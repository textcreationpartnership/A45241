            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been of old fore-propheſied that in the perillous latter times there ſhould be many <hi>murmurers</hi> and <hi>complainers (Jude v.</hi> 16.) who are ſeldome, if at all, ſatisfied with their lot, and with the diſpenſations of God toward them; And that becauſe (as is there added) they <hi>walk after their own luſts,</hi> and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but quarrel what doth croſſe them in that woful courſe, and complaine of their beſt and moſt uſeful enjoyments, if they finde not that ſatisfaction which they luſt after, in them: And we, in our times, have but too many ſad experiences of diſtempers of this kinde; evidencing the corrupt frame of our hearts, and our great diſtance from God occaſioning theſe diſtempers. But right diſcerners will judge otherwiſe of the Lords dealing. They will ſubmit unto, and acknowledge mercy in what is profitable; though it be not pleaſant, but grievous. They will read and acknowledge mercy in what they feele and ſuffer, when they conſider how much more they deſerve: and, They will admire the mercies which are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and continued with them in the midſt of wrath. Humility as it is a ſafe grace; and layeth a man low, beneath the violent blaſts which ſhake the lofty Cedars; So it is free of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe wherewith pride is attended and plagued, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. And in particular, True grace and humility will teach men to covet earneſtly after the beſt things, and to prize them, and bleſſe themſelves in the enjoyment thereof, though otherwiſe their condition be ſad and grievous. And indeed, if men under affliction, ought to enquire after, and eſteeme of God becauſe he hath endowed them with reaſonable ſouls, and <hi>teacheth them more then the beaſts of the earth, and maketh them wiſer then the fowles of heaven,</hi> Job 35.9, 10, 11. How much more ought they to prize the more ſpecial mercies of God continued with them? And eſpecially, that in the holy Scriptures he afords unto them the means of knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and an offer of Chriſt, with all the conſolations flowing from him, and an intereſt in him, and directions how to apply and improve the ſame in all caſes? Though this be the great and choice mercy aforded to the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. and to be eſteemed of above thouſands of gold and ſilver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72. as being able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, and containing matter of ſongs in the houſe of our pilgrimage; Yet it is not the ſimple enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this mercy, nor any pretence of an eſtimation thereof, that can prove a people bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, unleſſe in practice they labour to emprove the mercy, and do make uſe thereof as a glaſſe wherein to behold and know themſelves what they are, and be invited thereby to embrace and cloſe with Chriſt revealed therein, upon his own termes, and do ſtudy dayly to teſtifie their ſubjection to God ſpeaking in his Word, by ſetting it before them as the rule of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and to rejoyce in the conſolations thereof over all their ſorrows, bleſſing the Lord daily for the continuance thereof with them, though he ſtrip them of other things. And here, there is but too juſt cauſe of regrate, that though our day be ſhort, our journey long, and our way clear; Yet the generality of the viſible Church and profeſſors, are either idle, or out of
<pb facs="tcp:48148:4"/>
their way, and in their greateſt throng, are but labouring in the very ſire for vanity. If we look upon the moſt part of thoſe, we will finde that, being ignorant of their true good, or not giving credit to what is revealed in the Word concerning it, they do ſpend their ſtrength in ſeeking after <hi>any good,</hi> yea, or any <hi>ſhew</hi> of it, that hereby they may deceive and full themſelves aſleep, and take the beſt courſe they can to skin over theſe wounds, grievances and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which do attend miſerable and fallen man, the perfect cure whereof is onely to be found in Jeſus Chriſt; And that, by ſeeking more then is to be expected in and from the creature, they do not onely miſſe of their aime, but deprive themſelves of that good they might finde in the right uſe of the good creatures of God, all the dayes of their life. But it may further be regrated, that the abuſe of this mercy is more univerſal then that onely ſuch ſhould be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; Sad experience doth teſtifie how truly the Apoſtle did give warning, that in the laſt dayes, vileſt abominations ſhould mask themſelves under a forme of godlineſſe, denying the power thereof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and ſince the profeſſion of Religion hath been in any reputation among us, how frequently do we find men make uſe of a pretence of piety to render their vileſt errors plauſible; Yea, to carry on their ſelfiſh and carnal deſignes? Whence it is come to paſſe, that innocent and lovely holineſſe ſuffers for their ſake, and the Name of God is blaſphemed, and holineſſe ſo generally ſtumbled at, through them. Beſide, If we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who fear God indeed, How ſadly may it be lamented that they are idle, and turned off from their great work, to needleſſe diverſions and diſtractions? And among thoſe who are moſt buſie, How few are to be found who follow a right method in their walking? Many do covet more after what is adorning, then after what is ſaving; Some do earneſtly deſire after ſatisfaction to their ſenſe in the wayes of God, without acquainting themſelves with the ſolid way of living by faith: Some do habituate themſelves to a trade of diſcouragements; under which, after they have wreſtled awhile with anxieties and bitterneſſe; they fall faſter aſleep in ſecurity, then if they had a <hi>Delilah</hi> in their boſome. And generally, That Summary deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Goſpel way held out by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. is but the practice of very few. Men do not worſhip God in the Spirit, becauſe they learn not to rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus; and this they ſtudy not becauſe they are not put from all confidence in the fleſh, or, in any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Chriſt. And if they would begin at having no confidence in the fleſh, and look upon their being emptied of all things as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>As theſe conſiderations ſerve exceedingly to commend the patience and long-ſuffering of God, who hath not removed his Candleſtick from us, notwithſtanding our not walking in the light, and our abuſe of corrections, which have been ſent to chaſten us, for not entertaining the offer of ſalvation, and to quicken us in our Chriſtian courſe: And as they ought to excite all, in their ſtations, to mourn before the Lord, and to ſtand in the gap to make up the breach; and Miniſters in particular, to be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, if ſo be there may yet be a returning to him who ſmiteth, and we may become an afflicted and poor people truſting in the name of the Lord, and he may delight in us, and call us <hi>Hephzi-bah,</hi> and our Land <hi>Beulah:</hi> So it alſo hath prevailed with me to contribute my mite in this publick way (beſide my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weak travels in my charge) and to make offer of this Expoſition on that rich Treaſure of the Goſpel written by <hi>John.</hi> A ſubject (though handled by me briefly, and in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) full of the ſubſtance and marrow of Religion, tending (as <hi>John</hi> himſelf giveth an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſcope in it, <hi>Chap</hi> 20. 31,) to point out Chriſt the true remedy for ſinne, in his perſon, and offices, and to direct us how to attaine ſalvation through faith in him. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come to publick view, I have made bold to preſent it to the world under your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Names, and to joyne you together in this <hi>Dedication,</hi> whom God hath conjoyned in the ſtrict bond of nature; which is daily confirmed by that mutual reſpect, tenderneſſe and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which You bear one toward the other.</p>
            <p>It is not much my way, and I know Your Honours do not expect it, that I ſhould ſtuffe this Application with large commendations of You, or with acknowledgments of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to my ſelf, and Your kindneſſes towards others of my Relations. My great ſcope in it
<pb facs="tcp:48148:4"/>
is; As to encourage You in the good way wherein both Your Honours are engaged in Your ſeveral meaſures: So to excite and engage You yet more to emprove Your eminency (as You are or may be capable of this ſervice) for the advancement of Chriſts intereſts in this back-ſliding and degenerate time. Not that Chriſt needeth any ſuch help, who by weak things can confound the mighty, and by things that are not, bring to naught things that are. But that it is Your own true honour and intereſt, not to be among thoſe Nobles of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> who put not their necks to the work of the Lord; but to ſubject Your ſelves unto him, and lay out Your ſelves, in Your ſtations, for promoving his Kingdome, and the advancement of piety and the work of the Goſpel. As for your Honour, my Lady <hi>Weems,</hi> all the lovers of Chriſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> do with thankfulneſſe remember their obligations to Your late Father, The Right Honourable Earle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> of precious memory, whom the Lord raiſed up to be a prime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the late Reformation, and who ſpent himſelf, till his laſt breath, in that publick ſervice. And thoſe who know Your Ladiſhip beſt, will bear witneſſe that you have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in your Sphere, to trace his ſteps, not onely in Your private and ſecret practice, but in your open countenancing and encouraging of godlineſſe, and honeſt Miniſters of the Goſpel, at all occaſions: Wherein I truſt You ſhall be helped to perſevere and abound unto the end. Your Honour hath received many favours from the Lord, particularly; that he hath made you a joyful Mother of children, who are (the Lord continuing their life, for which I pray) to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſeveral Honourable families of the Land, beſide thoſe of them who are, or may be placed in other families, by marriage: Which, I doubt not, You look upon as a ſtrong obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lay forth Your ſelf that they may prove friends to truth and piety in their ſtation and generation. In ſubſerviency whereunto, I have preſented this piece to your Ladiſhip, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a brief hint at many of theſe precious truths which are neceſſary to ſalvation, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be inculcate upon theſe who minde the way to heaven. And for Your Honour, My La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Beuccleuch,</hi> Albeit, by reaſon of your young and tender years, many of theſe truths here preſented may tranſcend your capacity for preſent; yet as your grave, prudent, and ſweet diſpoſition and behaviour, your oppoſition to profanity, and reſpect to the Sabbath-day, and your careful obſervance of ſuch duties of Religion as your tender age is capable of, do much refreſh thoſe who are concerned in you, and converſe with you; (as being things not uſual in ſo tender an age; eſpecially in one who wants not ſufficient baits of worldly advantages and contentments to divert you) and do give good ground of hope, that if the Lord continue you, ye ſhall prove an ornament to your dignity and ſtation: So it hath engaged me to prefix your name alſo to this piece, as an incitement to you to proceed in that good courſe; and that your Ladiſhip may have an help ready at hand, from whence, as ye grow up, ye may drink in that ſound doctrine which is according to godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now that the Lord himſelf may bleſſe you both, in all your relations and concernments, may continue you long togther, may make you a bleſſing to each other, and may bleſſe this and the like means unto you, for your furtherance in faith and godlineſſe, till ye come to your eternal reſt, is the hearty prayer of</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I do again appear in Print, floweth from no other cauſe, but my deſire to do ſervice to the Church of Christ in my generation, and to contribute my endeavors for promoving that publike deſigne of making the holy Scriptures yet more cleare unto the Lords people. Some while ago I received ſuch an intimation of my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, as did excite me to emprove my time the beſt I could. And accordingly, I made haſte to perfect this Expoſition which formerly I had begun to caſt in this mould out of ſome Notes of Sermons I had preached on this Goſpel: And now, through the good hand of God upon me, thou haſt it here preſented compleat unto thee. I ſhall not ſay much to what is mine in it; But this may commend it unto thee, that the ſubject-matter is indeed divine, and as full of that marrow of the Chriſtian Religion as any other parcel of Holy writing. Here the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt myſteries of Religion are opened up by a beloved Diſciple. Christ is lively pointed out in his Perſon and Offices, and in his heart and affection to his people; We are here directed in the way of cloſing with him by faith, and the ſure grounds of loſt ſinners confidence are clearly demonſtrate. And albeit this Expoſition be ſwelled up to a great bulk upon my hand, yet ſuch is the riches of this Treaſure, that whoſo would ſearch into it, will finde that I have onely gathered ſome gleanings, and for what I have hinted at, I could with much leſſe trouble have given it more at large, then contracted it in theſe bounds. I need ſay nothing to the mould of it, being the ſame with that I made uſe of in the pieces formerly publiſhed. Onely, if any do think that the Summe of each Chapter is given too briefly, eſpecially toward the beginning of the Book; They will finde (for ſatisfaction) that to ſave my ſelf and them a labour, I have in going through the ſeveral parts of the Chapter ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that defect, and given a Summe of every part as I come to it. If any ſhall conceive that upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, to which they may turne, the Notes are not ſo many, nor ſo full, as might be expected; They may be pleaſed to conſider, that (beſide my too true Apology of my inability to ſatisfie the expectation of the judicious and learned, for whom this work is not chiefly intended) my ſcope is not in this to proceed after the way of a Sermon, on a ſelect place; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which occaſion many things might be brought in: But commenting upon an entire book of Scripture, I ſatisfied my ſelf with the moſt obvious things upon every particular verſe. And beſide, ſome purpoſes frequently occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, I reſolved to be more brief upon theſe afterward which I had once; and it may be, again, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before. And who ſo will be pleaſed to read the whole, or to compare the Notes on thoſe paſſages which frequently occurre, in all the places where they are obſerved, will (I hope) finde more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, then if they look onely on ſome one place: If the Reader finde many repetitions, not onely of the ſame Doctrines, but it may be alſo, of the ſame cautions or reaſons couched in, and ſubjoyned to the Doctrines, He ſhould conſider (beſide other reaſons) that in a work of ſuch bulk wherein there are ſo many doctrines, it was almoſt unpoſſible to get all in my view at once, that ſo I might have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected needleſſe repetitions. And as the Doctrines are (I hope) the genuine Doctrines of every place; and are, inculcate by Chriſt in his frequent repetitions of them; So I conceived it not fit to omit them: Eſpecially, ſeeing I could almoſt as briefly, and (I ſuppoſe) to better purpoſe, repeat them, then referre the Reader to the place where they had beene formerly obſerved. I ſhall adde no further Apology in behalf of this undertaking, but what ever my failings have been in it, (and I believe judicious Readers will finde more eſcapes then I could my ſelf obſerve) yet I hope thou wilt finde the Expoſition ſound, and the obſervations pertinent and Orthodox, and ſuch as may (through the Lords bleſſing) contribute to thy edification in the faith, which is in Jeſus Chriſt.

He was likewiſe entruſted by Chriſt upon the Croſſe, with the care of his mother, <hi>John</hi> 19.26, 27. and (which is above all) he was one ſpecially beloved of Chriſt, and very intimate with him, <hi>John</hi> 13.23. and 21.20, 24. After Chriſts aſcenſion, and the pouring out of the Spirit, he is employed with the reſt, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the glad tidings of ſalvation, and was joynt with <hi>Peter</hi> in healing of the creple, and enduring of the trials which followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. and 4. After that, we finde him ſent with <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8.14. &amp;c. Afterward, as hiſtories record, he went to <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſer, where he did propagate the Kingdome of Chriſt, not onely by preaching unto them, but by writing, at the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, to the edification of the whole Church, as appeareth by his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> whereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth he was the Penman. <hi>John</hi> 21.20, 24.</p>
               <p>His ſcope in this Narration of the Hiſtory of Chriſt, is to prove that Chriſt-man is alſo the very Son of God, and to clear up the way of ſalvation through faith in his Name, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 31. And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the time, and occaſion of his writing of it, as is (recorded in Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory) was, That, during the time of his exile in <hi>Pathmos,</hi> (where he wrote the <hi>Revelation</hi>) the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in <hi>Aſia</hi> were infeſted with many ſeducers, publiſhing their pernicious errors, as may be gathered alſo from his Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. and namely with <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who denied the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt; Therefore, after his return, (and ſo long after all the reſt of the Apoſtles were dead) he is ſet on work by Chriſt to write this Goſpel, and adde this witneſſe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, to make up a moſt perfect narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the uſe of the Church in all ages; Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth in a very ſublime way deſcribe and

aſſert the perſon, natures, and offices of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt all the errors of that time, or which might afterward trouble the Church; and, as the beloved Diſciple that had lien in his Maſters boſome, he ſoareth very high in ſpeaking of the great myſtery of godlineſſe. In his narration he doth not inſiſt to repeat what had been ſufficiently recorded by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſts, but pitcheth chiefly upon ſome noted, and ſpecial actions of Chriſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto divers of his excellent Sermons, upon the chief points of Chriſtian Religion, together with his ſolemn Prayer before his paſſion; which in the Lords holy and wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had been reſerved for ſuch a time and ſuch a Penman; and wherein the deepeſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſaith, and the rich treaſures of the godlies comfort, are clearly and ſatisfactorily pointed out.</p>

But further, becauſe as a word is a mean of revealing a mans mind to others; ſo Chriſt hath revealed the Father in his own perſon, <hi>being the brightnſſe of his glory and the expreſſe image of his perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3. ſo that God is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and is ſavingly known onely as he hath revealed himſelf in Chriſt; And in his office, as he is the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father,</hi> Prov. 8.12, 22, 23. and knoweth all the Fathers ſecrets, ſo he is the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father, as declaring him, his minde, and will to the Church in all ages, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 1 18. 2. As Chriſt in his perſon, natures and offices, is the great Theame of the Goſpel, and ought to be the matter of our ſtudie; ſo particularly it is needful that beleevers do know, and take him up as God; Not onely that they may avoid errours concerning his perſon, but, That they may ſee how little need he had of the ſon of men, whom yet he came to ſeek and ſave for their own good, not to receive from them, but to give unto them; That their faith may be led through the vaile of his fleſh, to this rock of his God head, where it will get ſure ſooting in his eſſence and attributes, againſt all aſſaults; That the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy of his Croſſe may not obſcure his glory, but they may have high and honourable thoughts of their humbled Lord in his loweſt eſtate; That they may ſee the infinite worth that is in his ſufferings, to ſatisfie juſtice, and to expiate ſin, conſidering the dignity of his perſon; And, That this may teach them rightly to receive his doctrine, and not to be aſhamed of his truth, and the profeſſion of his Name, or to ſuffer for him, who is ſo excellent a Lord: for theſe (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) reaſons, doth <hi>John</hi> begin this Goſpel, with ſo ſublime a deſcription of the Godhead of Chriſt. 3 The Godhead of Chriſt doth appear in his being eternal; and that he had his proper, and perfect ſubſiſtence; not onely before his incarnation, but before the firſt point of time, wherein God began to create all things; for, <hi>In the beginning was the Word:</hi> He doth not ſay as <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 1.1. (whom he imitates in this beginning of his Goſpel) <hi>In the beginning God created the Word;</hi> but, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> when all things created got a begining, <hi>the Word was,</hi> and did actually ſubſiſt. He thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth his eternity, that <hi>he was in the begining,</hi> becauſe there is nothing before the firſt period of times begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but eternity; and becauſe our ſhallow conceptions can follow eternity no farther, but onely over the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time. 4. Chriſt as God, is a perſon diſtinct from the Father, yet undivided and unſeparable from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his eſſence, with whom he eternally coexiſts; and this is another evidence of his Godhead; <hi>for the Word was with God;</hi> where the word in the Original ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48148:6"/>
God, with the Article, is taken perſonally, for <hi>the Father</hi> (as is alſo cleared. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.2.) ſignifying that he is one perſon, and the Father another <hi>with whom</hi> he was; As alſo that, notwithſtanding the diſtinction of the Perſons, yet he is inſeparably <hi>with the Father,</hi> in the ſame eſſence and nature, being <hi>in</hi> (as well as <hi>with) the Father, and the Father in him</hi> John 14.10, 11. and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally with him; ſo that the Father is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, <hi>John</hi> 17 5. 5. However men may take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to carp at theſe proofs of Chriſts Godhead, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging from his incarnation, that he was but man, or that there being but one God, the ſimplicity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence cannot admit of plurality of perſons, or that Chriſt in the exerciſe of the Mediatory office declareth that his Father is greater then he; or whatſoever elſe unſtable and deluded men may pretend; Yet the Holy Ghoſt puts the Godhead of Chriſt, his equality, and unity in eſſence with the Father out of all controverſie, &amp; would have it out of doubt in the hearts of believers, and all their reaſonings in this ſupernatural myſtery ſubjected to the revealed Word, which ſaith, <hi>and the Word was God:</hi> Where the Greek word ſignifying God, without the Article, is taken eſſentially, for the Divine nature, ſignifying, that as the Son is a diſtinct perſon from the Father, ſo he is one God with him, in the ſame indiviſible nature and eſſence, communicate unto him from the Father, and with him to the holy Spirit; ſo that their name, nature, properties, glorie, and working are one.</p>

How little able we are to comprehend this great myſtery, which we can but take in by little and little, and muſt put that together, as children do letters, ſyllables, and words, till we attaine a more full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, for our comfort and ſalvation; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>John</hi> repeat and conjoyne theſe two parts of the deſcription. 2. The knowledge of Chriſt as God, is a truth to be much and often inculcate upon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and which they ought to ſtudy again and again, and dwell upon, as having more in it then will be ſeene at firſt view; and when they have found moſt in it, yet there is infinitely more to be found in that inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible fountain; for, ſo much alſo doth this repetition teach. 3. It is but a robbing of Chriſt of his glory, to attribute unto him the name of God under any notion, or acknowledge any glory to belong unto him; unleſſe his ſubſiſtence from all eternity, and his eternal God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, one in eſſence, with, and a diſtinct perſon from the Father, be acknowledged; for <hi>John</hi> repeats and conjoynes his eternity with the other, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God,</hi> to ſhew that this aſſertion of his eternity is to be joyned with all the reſt; and that from all eternity he was God <hi>with the Father,</hi> one in eſſence, and a diſtinct perſon. 4. Chriſt who is God over all, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen,</hi> was in himſelf perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed, and infinitely happy and glorious from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity with his Father, before the world was made; Which he needed not to make, but onely it pleaſed him ſo to do, that he might let his glory ſhine therein, and communicate of his fulneſſe thereunto; and eſpecially to the children of men; for, ſo much alſo doth this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that <hi>he was in the beginning with God,</hi> before he made all things, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. import, as is alſo expounded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to 32. 5. The eternity of the Son of God is a ſubject worthy of ſerious meditation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; that ſo they may read all that tender-heartedneſs, theſe bowels of compaſſion, that mercifulneſſe and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy which is in him, to be not a mans onely, and in our kinſman; but in him who is alſo the eternal God, whoſe thoughts and purpoſes are eternal and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like himſelf; ſo much alſo may this repeated aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion teach us, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating whereof he puts us in minde to ſtudy it often, that we may reap more and more of the comforts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 6. The Sons coexiſtence with the Father, is alſo a matter ſeriouſly to be conſidered by beleevers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may ſee the deep wiſdome and rich love of God, who hath found a way of reconciliation of loſt man, by the ſame in nature and eſſence who is the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the unity of the Divine eſſence, and the diſtinction of perſons ſhould contribute to make the redemption and reconciliation of loſt man effectual by him; Wherein alſo believers, who have fled to Chriſt for refuge, may not onely finde him to be true God, able to ſupply all wants, and to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; but may alſo finde the Father in the Mediatour, as being one in eſſence with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and ſo, what he willeth, the Father alſo willeth; This alſo the repetition of his being <hi>with God</hi> may teach us, and that we ſhould ſtudy it, till we draw theſe or the like encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements from it. <hi>ver</hi> 3.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> having aſſerted the Godhead of Chriſt, as coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; coeſſential with the Father, he proceeds to prove the ſame yet farther by effects of his Divine attributes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in time, wherby he proves his ſubſiſtence before his incarnation, from ſeveral ſteps of his manifeſtation of himſelf to the world from the beginning thereof. The firſt ſtep of this manifeſtation, and proof of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, was in the creation of all things at the beginning, which is ſo univerſally aſcribed unto Chriſt, as nothing created is excepted, from being his handy-work. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> 1. The world and all things therein are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, but had a beginning, and were made by God, for this truth which is undeniable to right reaſon, is here made clear by revelation, <hi>all things were made.</hi> 2. Creation is an act of Divine power; and it is a proof of Chriſts Godhead, that he is the Creator of all things viſible and inviſible, and that all the creatures owe their very being to Chriſt the Son of God; for, <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> Col. 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. They were made <hi>by him,</hi> as working from the Father, the Father creating <hi>by him,</hi> the order of working follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of ſubſiſtence of the Divine perſons. 3. Chriſt is clearly excluded from being of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of creatures, in that he is not an inſtrument, but a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48148:7"/>
co-worker with the Father and Spirit in the work of creation, and that not of ſome creatures onely, but of all things that have a being by creation; So much doth <hi>Johns</hi> amplification inculcate, <hi>and without him was nothing made that was made:</hi> Where <hi>without him</hi> as a Creator doth not ſeclude the reſt of the perſons, who are with him, in their order of operation, in that work, but clearly ſecludeth him from being a creature, or any thing that was made. 4. It is uſeful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for believers to read the Godhead of Chriſt as ſhining in the creation of all things, by his omnipotent power; Wherein they may read a ground of intereſt to go to him as his own creatures, when other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are obſcured, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 73. They may ſee om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power, able to produce what they need, of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. and able to make a new work of creation in their regeneration, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.

                  <p>A further manifeſtation of Chriſt, and proof of his Godhead and ſubſiſtence before his incarnation, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his communicating of further excellency to ſome creatures then their bare being; as life to all living creatures, which was derived from him, and preſerved by him. And unto man, with his natural life, the light of reaſon and underſtanding alſo; together with holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the image of God, which was implanted in him at firſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It doth ſet forth the glory of Chriſt, and is a proof of his Godhead, that all creatures that live, have and hold their life of him not as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, but as the fountaine from whence their life floweth, and is preſerved; for, <hi>in him was life,</hi> Not onely hath he life in himſelf eſſentially from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.26. but the life of all living creatures, was <hi>in him,</hi> as in the fountaine cauſe, as the ſtreame is in the fountaine, and the rayes of light in the Sun: and <hi>in him</hi> ſtill as the preſerver when it is given, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conſtantly feeds the ſtream, that it dry not up; for <hi>in him we live,</hi> Acts 17.28. and, <hi>he upholdeth all things,</hi> Heb. 1.3. 2. Believers ought to ſtudy the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt their head, as ſhining in his giving life to all living creatures, and their having their life ſtill in him; That when they ſhall obſerve ſuch variety of living things from the leaſt to the greateſt, fed by that fountaine, they may come confidently to him for life and quickning, as to him who can create life, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a ſoul, and quicken a dead piece of clay: That they may not be diſcouraged by their baſeneſſe when they come to him, who diſdains not to communicate life to the baſeſt worme, and ſmalleſt midge, that they may hold their ſpiritual life of him, and by abiding in him, in whom life ſtill is, even when they get it; and, that they may not fear the decay of their life, when they dwell in him, in whom the inexhauſtible fountaine of life is, who preſerveth and continueth the life of all creatures. So much doth this proof of Chriſts God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head teach, <hi>in him was life.</hi> 3. In the creation man was exalted not onely above lifeleſſe creatures, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving life, but above all creatures, except Angels, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endowed with a reaſonable ſoul, and a faculty of underſtanding, and with the image of God, conſiſting in the lightſome and ſweet eſtate of clear knowledge in the underſtanding, of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in the will, and of peace, joy and comfort in the affections, for, <hi>the life was</hi> not onely the life, though man have life, but <hi>the light of men,</hi> he was endowed with a life of light. 4. The reaſonable ſoul of man, and the image of God, wherein he was at firſt created, was Chriſts gift, not as Mediatour (which office he did enter upon but after the fall) but as the Son of God, working with, and from the Father; By which work his Godhead is proven, the rayes of his glory ſhining ſo brightly in the making of man, that little world, and eſpecially of his moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, the ſoul, that none can conſider themſelves rightly, but they will ſee a finger of God in that work; for, this is another proof of his Divinty, <hi>the life,</hi> or the Son of God, the fountain and preſerver of life in living creatures was <hi>the light of men,</hi> or their life of light was from him as the fountain and preſerver, as was before ſaid of <hi>life.</hi> 5. Chriſt the Son of God, by creating man after his own image, and enduing him with a reaſonable ſoul, hath not onely laid obligations upon him, not to employ theſe noble endowments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Maker: But he hath alſo given an eſpecial pledge of his own reſpect to mankind, and a proof of his power, as Mediatour, to reſtore that image of God, which he at firſt implanted in him; As alſo of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and perfect knowledge of all things for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good; and of that life of light, and felicity, which he enjoyeth in himſelf with the Father and holy Spirit, to the ſight and fruition whereof he will at laſt bring beleevers, in ſuch a meaſure as finite man can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; for, therefore is this proof of his Divinity held forth by <hi>John,</hi> for the inſtruction and comfort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>

                  <p>A further proof of Chriſts Godhead, and of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and manifeſtation of himſelf before his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is taken from his dealing with man after the fall. He who is light in himſelf, and the fountain of light in man, did by divers means ſhine in mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and before man, now darkned by his fall; but was not entertained nor taken up as becometh: This is chiefly to be underſtood of the ſparkles of the light of nature ſhining in the darkened minde of man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. And of Chriſts ſhining in the view of all men in the works of creation, holding forth his eternal power and Godhead with the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures light could not by theſe meanes take him up, nor acknowledge him: Not ſecluding alſo (as is cleared from <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. where this ſubject is enlarged) his ſhining in the Church in all ages, after the fall of man to his incarnation, (as well as after it) as God and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, by Divine revelation, types and ſhadows, and other means: In which reſpect though ſome did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48148:7"/>
him as God and Mediatour, yet no man was able ſo to do (as at no time elſe) by the ſtrength or light of nature, and very few did acknowledge him at all (conſidering their natural darkneſſe) in the predictions and types pointing him out. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Man is fallen from that life of light and comfort whereinto he was created, and is become a dark maſſe of ſin and miſery, darkened in his minde with ignorance and abominable errours and miſtakes, and in his will and affections, with vices and luſts, and liable to a dark eſtate of diſcomfort, and ſorrow; for, ſo is ſuppoſed here, that he is not only <hi>dark,</hi> but <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> being wholly deprived of that light of the image of God, and over clouded with thick darkneſſe. 2 The Son of God did not ceaſe in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by ſundry rayes and beames, and means, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to communicate himſelf to fallen man; But did manifeſt himſelf unto all mankind by the light of nature, holding out ſome ſparkles of light concerning a Deity, and ſome principles of juſtice and moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and by the works of creation and providence: And to his Church, by Divine revelation did hold forth his perſon and office: All which do prove him to be God ſubſiſting before his incarnation, and do manifeſt his ſelf-ſufficiency that doth communicate himſelf to man now fallen from him: As alſo his love and pity to his own, that would thus follow them; And do prove that he exerciſed his office of Mediator before his incarnation; for it is a proof of Chriſts Godhead, and manifeſtation to the world in former ages, that the <hi>light,</hi> or, Chriſt the enlightner of mankind, <hi>ſhineth in darkneſſe;</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>ſhineth,</hi> in the preſent time, becauſe Chriſts manifeſtation of himſelf doth not ceaſe in all ages and times, though the way of it to his Church be changed by his incarnation; And becauſe his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſtations under the Goſpel are but the ſame continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing that was formerly, though in a different way. 3. What ever light men have by nature, or may gather from the book of creation; Yet ſuch is the power of darkneſſe in mans nature, that all who are left to theſe means do not receive that light, ſo as to let it ſhine through them to direct their actions, but do captivate it in unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, Nor do they take up that light which they have and uſe, to be from God, but become proud of it, as if it were their own; nor do they take up God as manifeſting himſelf in the works of creation, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and darken their own fooliſh heart more and more; far leſſe do they diſcerne the Son of God equal with the Father, nor can they diſcerne him as the true remedy of ſin thereby; for, <hi>the darkneſſe comprehended not the light that ſhineth in darkneſſe.</hi> 4.

                  <p>In the next branch of the firſt part of the Chapter, <hi>John</hi> having ſpoken of the manifeſtation of Chriſt before his incarnation, and how it did not ſuffice; he cometh to his more clear manifeſtation under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and beginneth (as the reſt of the Evangeliſts, and becauſe of that Prophecie, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5.) at <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> his forerunner, and by occaſion of him, ſpeaks yet more of Chriſt. Concerning this forerunner we have here held out, his calling, his name, and the ends of his calling and office, which were to point out and bear teſtimony concerning Chriſt, that men might be drawn to ſaith in him <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A ſpecial mean and way whereby Chriſt ſhineth to the world, and helpeth the world to know him, is the Miniſtry of men; whereby he condeſcendeth to our weakneſſe, who could not endure more glorious inſtruments; he trieth our obedience, and acknowledgment of his authority in the weak meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and he maketh manifeſt that the excellency of the power whereby they do ſo great things, is of him; Therefore doth he bring in <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mean whereby he ſhined. 2. Miniſters of Chriſt muſt not run unſent, but ought to have a calling from God, either extraordinary (in extraordinary times and caſes) or ordinary; as being that which will afford them matter of courage in undertaking their work, of comfort under difficulties, and of hope of ſucceſſe; for, ſo <hi>John was a man ſent from God;</hi> to wit, in an extraordinary way, as Chriſts forerunner. 3. Albeit an unregenerate man may be a lawful Miniſter, yet they will in a moſt lively way proclaime that geace of God bringing ſalvation, who have themſelves obtained grace and favour by it: And it is a ſweet thing, when men prove anſwerable to theſe names and titles which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture giveth them, becauſe of their Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for, this forerunners <hi>name was John,</hi> a name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Angel, without the conſent of friends, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.13.59, 60. &amp;c. which in the Hebrew ſignifieth, one that had obtained grace and favour, or, one to whom the Lord had been gracious that he might actively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the ſame to others, and a name to which <hi>Johns</hi> carriage was anſwerable. He was one, in giving of whom the Lord ſhewed himſelf gracious to his parents, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.13. One, to whom the Lord was gracious, in ſanctifying of him from his mothers womb, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him faithful and ſucceſſeful in his Miniſtry, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 77, 78. 4. The chief and ſpecial end of a Miniſtry, is, to point out Chriſt in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and uſefulneſſe to loſt men, to declare him in his perſon, offices and benefits, how he ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeved in, ſerved or ſuffered for; <hi>John came to beare witneſſe of the light,</hi> or of Chriſt in his glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and as he is the light of dark man, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and directions. 5. Faithful Miniſters are to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48148:8"/>
preach Chriſt as his witneſſes, with plaineſſe, with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in not adding or diminiſhing, with boldneſſe and conſtancy; and as men by whom Chriſt (who nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s not any teſtimony from men) doth temper and fit his light to our capacity, and who will be witneſſes one day againſt them who do not receive their doctrine; for, <hi>the ſame came for a witneſſe to beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> 6. The end and ſcope of a Miniſters witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and preaching is, and ſhould be, to bring ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to beleeve in Chriſt; his preaching of the Law and wrath is in order to that, and to bring men to ſee their need of Chriſt, and ſhould be joyned with the doctrine of the Goſpel; His preaching of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſanctification and holineſſe ſhould be joyned with the doctrine of faith in Chriſt, from whom vertue floweth, for that end: And faithful Miniſters ſhould not be content that their excellent gifts lead men to eſteeme of themſelves; but it ſhould be their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lead men unto Chriſt; for, albeit <hi>John</hi> did threaten ſharply, and call them a generation of Vipers, and did preſſe repentance and renovation hard; yet <hi>the ſame came for a witneſſe, that men through him</hi> (or by his Miniſtry and his leading them not to reſt or doat upon himſelf) <hi>might beleeve.</hi> 7. No man is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being allowed to beleeve in Chriſt, who hath the ofter, but every one of whatſoever condition or quality, who heareth the Goſpel, is bound to make this uſe of it, following the due order appointed for ſinners to come to Chriſt; And particularly, under the Goſpel, Chriſt is to be held forth as the common refuge of all his people of whatſoever kindred or Nation; for, <hi>John came for a witneſſe that all men might beleeve,</hi> not that all, even of <hi>Judaea,</hi> heard <hi>John,</hi> but that all who heard, were thus obliged, and all indifferently of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were now allowed to come to Chriſt.</p>

Chriſt is light by nature and of himſelf, not by participation onely, as creatures are; And whatſoever is ſaid of him as a light, is truly and really in him, and whatſoever is borrowed from the creatures to ſet out his excellency, is in him really and truly, and they are but ſhadows compared with him; for, <hi>that was the true light,</hi> ſaith he, not that <hi>John</hi> was a falſe light, but he was light by nature, <hi>John</hi> a ſtar and candle, borrowing light, and lighted from him; What is ſaid of the light of truth in him, againſt error, of comfort againſt trouble, of remiſſion, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, &amp;c. is really and truly to be found in him, and in him onely; and all the excellency we finde in light for the good of creatures, is far more eminently and truly to be found in him for the good of ſouls. 4. The efficacie and vertue of Chriſt, the light of his people, is, ſuch, as he cannot onely ſhine on them and make them diſcernable, as the Sun doth on inferiour creatures, but he can ſhine through them, and make them to be enlightned themſelves; This Sun ſhining can give an eye to what he ſhineth on; for, <hi>the true light lighteth,</hi> &amp;c. 5. All the light that men have, is borrowed from Chriſt; All the light of reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every one hath, and all the light of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the world, albeit Chriſt had made the world, and was ſtill preſent in it by his power and providence, yet the men of the world did not know him, nor take him up: As for the viſible Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> albeit, beſide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manifeſtations in the world, he came yet nearer to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48148:8"/>
them; yet the body of them did not receive nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him. This challenge holds true of the world and of the viſible Church in all ages, to whom he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neer by his Word and Ordinances, though here it be ſpoken eſpecially with relation to the time before his incarnation, if not alſo to his coming in perſon to the Church of <hi>Iſrael, Luke</hi> 20.13, 14, 15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

As Chriſts creating of the world is a manifeſtation of his glory to be ſeriouſly ſtudied, (and therefore is here again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated) ſo his creating of it is ſufficient to prove his conſtant preſence in it; it being impoſſible for the creatures made by him to ſubſiſt without him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſubjoyned to the former, <hi>he was in the world, and the world was made by him,</hi> as a proof that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to be in it, becauſe he made it. 3. It is the ſin of the world, not to know or take notice of Chriſt in his manifeſtations; And particularly it is the ſin of men without the Church, that they do not acknowledge nor glorifie God, when he manifeſts his glory to them in the works of creation and providence; for, <hi>the world knew him not.</hi> 4. God may juſtly make uſe of very common favours and means, as ſufficient to aggravate the ſinne of ſuch as do not acknowledge him; for ſaith he, <hi>he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not,</hi> which imports that his making of the world, and his preſence in it, was ſuch a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, as might have led them to know, acknowledge, and glorifie him as God, and that they were without excuſe, who having theſe means, did it not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. And that the common favour of mens being, and Gods providence about them, doth heighten their ſin who do not acknowledge their Maker, <hi>Iſa</hi> 1 3. 5. Beſides Chriſts common intereſt in all mankind as their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and his ſpecial intereſt in his own elect and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people; he hath alſo an intereſt in a viſible Church, and they in him, which no other people have, and that by vertue of a viſible Covenant, and election to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges of the Church; for in this reſpect the body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are <hi>his own,</hi> or his peculiar people. This intereſt may give ſelf-condemned ſinners a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go to him, as born in his own houſe, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priviledges are obſcured from them. 6. Chriſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before his incarnation, was preſent in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and beſide his common and general preſence, he drew neerer unto them, in his Word and Ordinances, and types pointing him out as Mediator, till at laſt he came to them in Perſon; for, even then, <hi>he came to his own.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 7.38. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9 7. All the favour and kindneſſe that is betwixt Chriſt and his people, begins at him, and he is at the pains to ſeek and come to them firſt, though he ſtand in no need of them; for, <hi>he came to his own.</hi> 8. Common relations betwixt Chriſt and a viſible Church are ſo farre from proving a peoples good condition, as to the particular ſtate of their ſoul, that ſuch may, and oftentimes do refuſe to make Chriſt and his offer welcome; for, <hi>his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not</hi> 9. The neerer the relation be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his people, and the greater his offer be, the ſin of not making uſe of it is the greater in it ſelf, and he will take the refuſall the worſe at their hand, as being a deſpiſing of his love; for, <hi>whereas the world knew him not,</hi> v. 10. their ſin was greater, that <hi>they received him not,</hi> when they knew him, and ſo ſinned of contempt: And Chriſt takes this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Chriſts excellency and manifeſtation of himſelf are here ſpoken of with relation to theſe, who, at any time, do embrace his offer made in the Church: His excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency herein appeareth, 1. In prevailing with ſome to make him and his offer welcome, though many reject it. 2. In advancing them to the dignity of Adoption and ſon-ſhip, who thus embrace him: And he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clears, how it is that men do receive Chriſt, to wit, by faith; and, whence it is that any come to beleeve, and ſo attain to the dignity of ſons; even from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of regeneration, which is wrought by no power of the creature, but by God only. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Howſoever many within the viſible Church do reject Chriſt, yet there will ſtill be ſome to make him welcome. As he never lighteth a candle, but where he hath ſome loſt groat to ſeek; So he hath excellency, even when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſpiſe him, to allure hearts, and vertue, not to take a refuſal, but to draw his own till they be made willing; for, there are who <hi>receive him.</hi> 2. Such as make the offer of grace right welcome, do firſt welcome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt himſelf, not contenting themſelves with his common gifts, nor yet ſeeking firſt after his ſaving graces, but after himſelf, that he may work theſe in them; for, <hi>they receive him.</hi> 3. Chriſt is received and made welcome by faith; and all they, who, hearing of the offer made to the Church on Chriſts part, do out of the ſence of their need, embrace, and conſent and roll themſelves upon Chriſt thus offered, theſe have made up an union with him, and are beleevers, though as yet they have not attained to particular aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is the fruit of the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. for, they who <hi>receive him,</hi> are even they that beleeve. 4. Such as rightly beleeve in Chriſt, ought not to take him up as in their preſumption, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, fear or diſcouragement they may imagine, but they ought to cleave cloſe to the Word revealing him, and bring all their thoughts of him to the touch-ſtone thereof, correcting them thereby, and ſubmitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for, they <hi>beleeve on his Name,</hi> or, as he hath revealed himſelf. 5. As all ſpiritual priviledges are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48148:9"/>
in Chriſts hand and diſpoſing; So, albeit we be by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath, yet he offers reconciliation to ſuch, and whoſoever they be that by faith receive him, he conferreth upon them the priviledge to become heirs and co-heirs with himſelf, and children unto God, with allowance to call him father; And inſtead of a ſlaviſh and worldly ſpirit, and a ſpirit of fear and bondage, he giveth them the ſpirit of enlargement, and of ſons, and a diſpoſition ſutable to their dignity and high calling in every condition; for, as <hi>many</hi> (of whatſoever rank or condition) <hi>as received him, to them he gave power</hi> (or, right, priviledge and dignity) <hi>to become the ſonnes of God.</hi> 6. As it is by faith that we come to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Adoption, by cloſing with Chriſt the onely begotten Son; ſo when we have beleeved, adoption is ſtill his gift, it being ſtill of grace that he exalts us to that dignity; and when we have done all, the comfort of that dignity muſt be his work, by ſending the ſpirit of ſonnes into our hearts, to loaſe our bands and elevate our hearts; for, <hi>he gave power to become the ſons of God.</hi> 7. Every one who is adopted to be a ſon of God, muſt have a new birth and ſpiritual being in Chriſt, by a change of diſpoſition, and qualities of the ſoul going along with that priviledge, to prove the truth of it; for, theſe ſons of God <hi>are borne,</hi> to wit, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> By this change they will be led to eſteeme high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this dignity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. to ſtudy conformity with Chriſt their elder brother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and to performe obedience, whatever they can attain to, with childrens diſpoſitions, out of fear to offend their Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. which are the kindly evidences of adoption. 8. Faith and receiving of Chriſt is ſo much the gift of God, as firſt by regeneration, Chriſt muſt make an inward offer, and joyne himſelf to us, and give us this hand to grip, before we can by faith actively receive him, or ſet about the work of ſanctification by faith; for, all who <hi>beleeve on his Name, were born again.</hi> 9. The change of man out of nature into grace, is a kind of new birth of the man, in producing whereof there will be ſome travelling in pain, by it there is brought forth a proportionable new man of grace; ſpreading it ſelf (though weakly as in the natural man) through the whole man; alſo a new life, and likeneſſe to the Father, an appetite after food ſutable to that life, and a being ſenſible of hurt from what is contrary to this life; for, ſo is imported in that they are <hi>borne.</hi> 10. Regeneration cometh not by natural generation, or by the dignity of mens race and deſcent from pious progenitors, for, <hi>they were borne not of blood,</hi> or <hi>of bloods,</hi> that is, by deſcent from their anceſtors of many generations, of which the Jewes boaſted. 11. Mens freewill, or natural power, is quite dead in the matter of regeneration, its utmoſt endeavours can contribute nothing to this work; for, <hi>they were borne, not of the will,</hi> or the ſtrongeſt inclinations, <hi>of the fleſh:</hi> 12. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſingular endowments of learning, wiſdome, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour men have, yet none of theſe do prove regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor can they contribute any thing to ſuch a work; for, <hi>they were borne, not of the will of man,</hi> or, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and vertuous men, as the word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal often ſignifieth. 13. Regeneration is Gods own work, who employeth his Word as the ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. ſendeth his Miniſters as inſtruments to ſowe this ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. and who quickeneth this ſeed by the Spirit, who is the immediate worker of regeneration in order of operation, <hi>John</hi> 3.6, 8. And ſo, whatever excellency regenerate men may have they are ſtill bound to acknowledge that grace prevented them, and made them to differ from others; for, they were born, not of any thing, <hi>but of God.</hi>

The Son of God became true man, and did take on our nature with all the eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, and all the common infirmities thereof, yet without ſin; for, ſo much is imported in that he was made <hi>fleſh,</hi> by which name is not ſignified that he aſſumed onely a body, his divinity ſupplying the place of a ſoul; for, as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is ſometime taken for the whole man, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.47. ſo alſo is <hi>fleſh, Pſal.</hi> 145.21.

But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation ſerveth to point out the reality of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, that he was true man, having a real body with all the properties thereof; And it points out his ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And is able not onely to ſuffer, but to carry through the work, to apply his own purchaſe, and repair all our loſſes. 6. As the ingratitude of the world did not hinder the Son of God to come into the world, and to take on our nature, ſo it pleaſed him in our nature to live in the world for a ſpace; That ſo he might prove the truth of his humanity to theſe who converſed with him; That he might ſanctifie the earth, by his reſidence upon it, as a place of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples pilgrimage, that he might in his owne perſon, who was greater then <hi>Moſes,</hi> abrogate the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and, That he might perfect the work of mans redemption appointed to him of the Father; Wherein his great love appeared, that no provocation, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners did prevaile with him to leave the earth, till he had perfected his work; for, the <hi>Word was made fleſh and dwelt among us</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> in name of all the Apoſtles. 7.

The glory of his Godhead did fill this Tabernacle and ſhine forth in view of his diſciples (as after followeth) as the glory of the Lord filled that Tabernacle, <hi>Exod</hi> 40.34, 35. And the Son of God thus incarnate, is the tryſting place wherein ſinners may draw neer unto, and meet with God, as of old they ſought him in the Tabernacle. Therefore it is ſaid in the Original, He, or, <hi>the Word dwelt as in a tent, or Tabernacle among us.</hi> 8. Chriſt our Lord during his abode in the world was content to ſubmit to a meane and pilgrims life, That through his poverty many might become rich; That he might ſanctifie a poor condition of life to his followers; and, That he might aſſure us of his being a fellow-feeling High-Prieſt, having been in his own perſon partaker of our miſeries; for, ſo much alſo is imported in that <hi>he dwelt as in a tent or Tabernacle</hi> (which is the habitation of pilgrims) <hi>among us;</hi> And to this alſo doth the type of the ancient Tabernacle agree, which was ambulatory, and fitted to their wandring conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Though Chriſt alſo be the ſubſtance of the type of the fixed Temple, <hi>John</hi> 2.21. 9. Chriſt alſo came into the world, and dwelt in it, to undertake a warfare, and did undertake, Devils, men, death, and all that had any thing to ſay againſt his people; and did overcome them, that ſo his people might have to do with vanquiſhed enemies, and might go to him in need, as to one who had experience of hard conflicts and exerciſe in his own perſon; for, ſo much further doth his <hi>dwelling as in a tent</hi> (which is a military habitation) import. 10. Chriſt in his abaſement and ſufferings, did not ceaſe to be the ſame glorious and excellent Lord ſtill, and this his glorious excellency and Godhead did ſhine through the veile of his fleſh, and in his low condition, and was ſeene by all them who got anointed eyes, and ſeriouſly conſidered it; for, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> in name of the Apoſtles and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>we ſaw</hi> (or, <hi>did contemplate,</hi> and ſeriouſly view, till we diſcerned) <hi>his glory;</hi> His ſtarres appearing while he was lying in a manger, the Angels proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his birth to the ſhepheards, his diſputing with the Doctors when he was young; the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances at his Baptiſme and transfiguration; yea, the whole courſe of his doctrine, miracles, and ſufferings, aſcenſion, and pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, did abundantly evince this. And by this we are taught not to judge of him nor of his members accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward appearance. 11. Chriſt, as God, comes of the Father by way of inexpreſſible genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proper to himſelf onely, as being an eternal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by communication of the ſame eſſence and properties; And a generation wherein the Father is not before the Son, but both alike eternal: And this his glory did ſhine forth in his loweſt condition; for, his glory was <hi>the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father:</hi> that is, ſuch glory as was ſutable and becoming Gods onely begotten Son; for, <hi>as,</hi> here, is not a note of ſimilitude or likeneſſe, as when we ſay of a beggar, <hi>he goeth as</hi> (or like) <hi>a King,</hi> but a note of ſutableneſſe, as when we ſay of a King, <hi>he goeth as</hi> (or as becometh) <hi>a King.</hi> And by this Chriſt is commended to his people, as he who ſhould be onely and chief in their hearts. 12. Albeit Chriſt converſed in the world in a poor and meane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet his furniture for the worlds behoof was rich, And particularly, there was in him grace; or the free favour of God, as a remedy for that wrath which the Law revealeth becauſe of ſin, and the gifts of grace to cure, and remove ſin; <hi>In him did the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwell bodily,</hi> and on him as man, was the ſpirit poured forth above meaſure; and he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this grace, to ſupply all his peoples wants, to make up the greatneſſe of their miſery, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48148:10"/>
even their abuſe of grace; for, <hi>he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us full of grace;</hi> as the conſtruction in the Original conjoyneth them. 13. Chriſt alſo came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world fraught with truth, and fulneſſe of truth, being as God, truth it ſelf, and as man, full of truth by vertue of the perſonal union; having treaſures of knowledge for all our ignorance and errours, the truth of all the ſhadows of the Law, and what was foretold of him by word, or ſignes, being found in him, and all that is in him, and ſaid of him, being true and ſolid, and ſuch as will not diſappoint us, whereas other things without him, prove but ſhadows; for, <hi>he dwelt among us full of truth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the firſt teſtimony, he holds forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, firſt, as being above himſelf in dignity,</hi> ver. 15. Next, <hi>as being above all beleevers in the point of fulneſſe, and ſufficiency for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of loſt ſinners,</hi> ver. 16. Thirdly, <hi>as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to</hi> Moſes <hi>the Miniſter of the Law,</hi> ver. 17. Fourthly, <hi>as being preferred to all men in the point of knowing and revealing of God.</hi> ver 18.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt branch of this commendation, Chriſt being now immediately gone from <hi>John</hi> after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, to be tempted in the Wilderneſſe (and therefore he ſaith, <hi>this was he,</hi> ſpeaking of one who had been with him, but was now gone) <hi>John</hi> doth repeat his former teſtimonies, and apply them to this individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſon who had been with him; Wherein he had declared, and yet again doth declare, that howſoever Chriſt did come after him in time of nativity, and in time of manifeſtation and execution of his office; Yea, and after him for a time in place, as coming to be baptized by him, and as yet more obſcure then he: Yet he was truly before him in dignity of perſon and office, as being the eternal God. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is a commendable and ſweet thing when Miniſters prove faithful in their truſt, and mind the work about which they are ſent; for, <hi>John</hi> was ſent <hi>to bear witneſſe of the light,</hi> ver. 7. and accordingly his practice is, <hi>John bare witneſſe of him.</hi> 2. The teſtimony of faithful Miniſters doth not evaniſh with the publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor dieth with themſelves, but continueth as a conſtant witneſſe to all thoſe to whom the knowledge thereof cometh: And particularly, it is ſo with the doctrine of extraordinary Meſſengers, whoſe doctrine being recorded, ſtandeth as a conſtant witneſſe; for, in the Original it is, <hi>John beareth witneſſe of him,</hi> in the preſent time, though <hi>John</hi> was long ſince dead. 3. Faithful Miniſters having to do with hearers at a great diſtance from God; who are deaf, and diſtracted with the noiſe of tumultuous luſts, had need to be earneſt and inſtant in their doctrine, and ſhould in plain termes, not going about the buſh, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fearleſſeneſſe, and with fervency, and not for the faſhion only, publiſh what they have in commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, in theſe reſpects, <hi>John bare witneſſe of him, and cried.</hi> Beſide that <hi>John,</hi> entring to his Miniſtry in a year of Jubilee, as is ſuppoſed, did thus become the trumpeter to proclaime the acceptable year of the Lord. 4. Chriſt needeth not viſible manifeſtations of himſelf, to invite ſuch as know him from the Word, to commend him, and eſteeme highly of him; for, <hi>John,</hi> before Chriſt came unto him, or he ſaw him, had given ample teſtimonies concerning him, <hi>This was be of whom I ſpake,</hi> even all theſe teſtimonies before Chriſts Baptiſme, recorded by the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts. 5. As faithful Miniſters ought to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people for Chriſts manifeſtations of himſelf; So when he doth manifeſt himſelf, a Miniſter is yet need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to expound theſe manifeſtations to be the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that ſo they may not be miſtaken nor ſtumbled at; Therefore, <hi>John</hi> having ſpoken of Chriſt before he manifeſted himſelf, finds it needful to apply that doctrine to that perſon, that they might not ſtumble at his low condition. <hi>This was he of whom I ſpake.</hi> And we are ready to fall in the like miſtake of his promiſed comforts and outgoings, when they come. 6. Chriſts real excellency and worth is ſuch, that commenders of him according to his word, will never have cauſe to change their note, but when he manifeſts himſelf, they will ſee all true that was ſaid of him, and when again he obſcureth himſelf; there is no cauſe to change our thoughts; for, here when Chriſt comes to <hi>John,</hi> he points him out, as making good all he had ſaid, and when now he is gone to the Wilderneſſe to be hungry and to be tempted of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> ſaith the ſame things of him, <hi>This was be of whom I ſpake, &amp;c.</hi> 7.

The dignity and eternity of Chriſts perſon as God, ſets him up above all creatures, how excellent ſoever; for albeit as man, he was for a time made a little lower then the Angels, yet by vertue of the perſonal union, he is, even as man, made head of Angels. And as God, there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the creatures; So much doth <hi>Johns</hi> reaſon teach us, <hi>he is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>

                  <p>In the next branch of this commendation, <hi>John</hi> preferreth Chriſt to all beleevers, as being he in whom all fulneſſe dwelleth, and from whoſe fulneſſe: all graces and gifts that ever any had, or hath, do flow, in all the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48148:10"/>
ſteps and degrees thereof. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. All men, and even the choiſeſt of Chriſts ſervants, are by nature, and of themſelves, empty of any thing that is good; for, ſo much is implied in that we muſt <hi>receive of his fulneſſe.</hi> 2. All fulneſſe of grace and goodneſſe for ſupply of beleevers wants, is treaſured up in Chriſt; He hath an increated fulneſſe as God, and as man, a created fulneſſe; A fulneſſe of dignities and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives; a fulneſſe of divine perfections, gifts, and graces anſwerable to theſe dignities, the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily, and the Spirit without meaſure is poured out upon him; for, this is alſo ſuppoſed that he hath <hi>this fulneſſe.</hi> 3. The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in Chriſt is for the ſupply of all beleevers wants, as their treaſure and ſtore-houſe. Theſe who come to him, he needs them not to receive from them, but to give unto them, he needs not their fulneſſe, but their emptineſſe, that his fulneſſe may overflow to the ſupply thereof; And this may invite ſinners to come to him as they need; for, <hi>of his fulneſſe we receive,</hi> 4. God hath in great mercy ſo ordered the way of his peoples ſalvation, as not to entruſt their own ſtock of grace into their own hands, as he did to <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, but to put them and their allowance in Chriſts hand, that he might keep it for them, who can contain infinitely more then they could receive, and they may come and draw it daily out of him as they need; for, ſo is it ordered here that he hath the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>we receive of his fulneſſe.</hi> 5. There is no man of any rank, quality, or degree that hath any gift or grace, but he hath it of Chriſt; The moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ought to look humbly on what he hath as Chriſts gift, and the meaneſt ought to adore and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his wiſdome and love who lets out ſuch a meaſure to every member as he pleaſeth, for, <hi>of his fulneſſe have all we,</hi> Prophets, Apoſtles, Beleevers, &amp;c. <hi>received.</hi> 6. Whatever beleevers get from Chriſt, yet he remaineth ſtill full; as the ſea diminiſheth not by rivers coming from it, and as the Sun doth not wear nor loſe light, by giving light to all; ſo Chriſt is ſtill the ſame for fulneſſe, notwithſtanding what he communicateth; for, it is <hi>of his fulneſſe we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> it is ſtill <hi>fulneſſe</hi> when all <hi>receive</hi> of it. 7. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any receive of Chriſt, it comes of grace, and not of merit; and the free favour of God, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious effects thereof, are the chief fruits flowing from Chriſts fulneſſe; for, in both theſe reſpects it is ſaid <hi>all we receive,</hi> and (or, even) <hi>grace.</hi> 8. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do receive true grace from Chriſt, they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving grace after grace; And as they do not receive grace all at once, but by degrees and ſo ſhould not ſit up on any meaſure received; So Chriſts giving of grace unto them is an argument why he will give them yet more grace; for, <hi>we have received grace for grace,</hi> that is, grace upon grace, grace after grace, and more grace, becauſe he hath already given grace. 9. Not onely what the Elect do receive at their firſt converſion, but even what they receive after grace given, comes not of merit, but from the firſt to the laſt, is grace ſtill; for, it is <hi>grace for grace,</hi> and ſo ſtill grace, and grace for graces ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.7. 10. This grace received by us <hi>for grace,</hi> or, <hi>anſwering to grace,</hi> as the Original will bear, may relate to grace in Chriſt and coming by Chriſt; And ſo it may teach further. 1. Chriſt is not onely the ſtore-houſe, from whoſe fulneſſe grace floweth to beleevers, but the procuring cauſe thereof alſo; grace being given to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his redemption and righteouſneſſe made theirs of free grace; And becauſe his gracious acceptance with the Father as Mediator, takes in all his people in and with him; Thus do <hi>we receive grace for</hi> (or, <hi>be cauſe of) grace</hi> in him, and flowing from him. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. 2. As every beleever is a member of Jeſus Chriſt his myſtical body, ſo do they in their own meaſure, as members, receive grace anſwering to the grace poured out on him as head; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſonnes and co-heirs anſwering to his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in their meaſure and getting proportionable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that there may be a conformity betwixt head and members; for, ſo we do <hi>receive grace for grace,</hi> or <hi>anſwering to grace,</hi> to wit, in him.</p>

                  <p>In the third branch of this commendation, (which cleareth alſo the former, of his fulneſſe to communicate grace for grace, and therefore is joyned with it by the particle, <hi>for) John</hi> preferreth Chriſt not only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, on whom the Jewes doated ſo much: And that, both in reſpect of the Doctrine and benefits brought by either of them to the world; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being the Miniſter of the Law, which reveales wrath, and pointeth out Chriſt in dark types, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification under Ceremonial waſhings; And Chriſt bringing grace and truth with him, to releeve ſuch as groaned under theſe Legal adminiſtrations: And, in reſpect of their perſons, and way of conveighing theſe benefits; <hi>Moſes</hi> being but an inſtrument and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger carrying that doctrine which he delivered, and Chriſt being the Author and procurer of theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he revealed to the world. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The faithful ſervants of Chriſt will not onely be afraid to meddle with his glory themſelves, but will cry down all glory that is given to any other, to Chriſts preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; and will ſtudy to exalt him above the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of men, conſidered in their beſt things; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> preferreth Chriſt unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as to himſelf, and that in theſe things wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> was moſt eminent; as his going up to the Mount to God, and his receiving of the Law from him. 2. Albeit the doctrine of free grace was revealed in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; and by him, and renewing grace, and grace as a remedy againſt the rigour of the Law was then known: Yet it was but very obſcurely revealed, and ſparingly let forth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the times of the Goſpel; And in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the paedagogy of the Law was much inſiſted on, preſſing the Moral Law of duties under the pain of the curſe, and holding out Chriſt under dark ſhadows; In this reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>the Law was given by Moſes,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>grace and truth</hi> brought by Jeſus Chriſt. 3 The legal pedagogy as it is contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the grace offered in the Goſpel, is a very hard and unſupportable yoke; for, in that reſpect the Moral Law requireth compleat and perſonal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under the pain of Gods curſe, and yet giveth no ſtrength to performe any thing; it beareth in our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48148:11"/>
duty upon us with rigour and terrour, diſcovereth our miſery without ſhewing a remedy, bringeth on a ſpirit of bondage without any hope of releaſe, irritates and provokes nature to ſin yet more, &amp;c. And the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law contained but a ſhadow of good things to come, was a veile caſt over <hi>Moſes</hi> face, and was a toilſome yoke, for theſe cauſes the <hi>Law by Moſes</hi> is poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to what Chriſt bringeth. 4. In Chriſt there is an caſe and relief to beleevers againſt all the burdenſomneſſe of the Law; And particularly, by the Goſpel he hath publiſhed the free grace and favour of God, accepting the ſelf-condemned ſinner in him, and freely juſtifying the ungodly through his imputed righteouſneſſe, conferring grace freely to ſanctifie and cure the perverſneſſe of mens nature, and ſo fitting them for glory. He hath alſo taken off the veile of <hi>Moſes</hi> face, being himſelf the ſubſtance of all the ſhadows. And having given the performance of all the promiſes; for, <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 5. Albeit Chriſt hath aboliſhed the Ceremonial Law, and hath aboliſhed the Moral Law to beleevers, in its condemning, curſing, and irritating power; Yet none get good of grace through Chriſt, but ſuch as are ſent by the Law as ſelf-condemned to him for a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſuch as continue under the Law as a rule of life, being enabled to the obedience thereof by Chriſt; for, not onely doth Chriſt bring <hi>truth</hi> of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, anſwering to all their legal purifications under the Law, but <hi>grace</hi> alſo, which preſuppoſeth a work of the Law diſcovering ſin and wrath, and grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling ſuch as come to him to endeavour obedience thereunto; And thus Chriſt eſtabliſhed the Law, not onely by fulfilling the ſame in his own perſon, as our ſurety, but by making his members alſo to walk in ſome meaſure according to it, which the Law of it ſelf could not do. 6. Chriſt is above <hi>Moſes,</hi> not onely in reſpect of the benefits or doctrine he publiſheth, but inreſpect of his efficiency about theſe benefits, he is above him, and all other Meſſengers, who are but inſtruments and meſſengers publiſhing the doctrine which they receive, and the benefits held out therein; whereas Chriſt is the Author and procurer, as wel as the publiſher of the ſpiritual benefits of the Goſpel; for, <hi>the Law was given by Moſes, as a Meſſenger,</hi> receiving the ſame from God, to deliver it to the people, <hi>but grace and truth came,</hi> (or was made, or <hi>brought to paſſe) by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>In the laſt branch of this commendation, Chriſt is preferred to all men in the point of ſeeing and knowing of God, and in particular, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that he ſaw God, and God talked face to face with him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.8. It is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that God is inviſible and incomprehenſible by any, ſave by his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, who being one in eſſence with the Father, and upon all his councels, doth perfectly know him, and doth reveale unto mankind all that they know of him. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. God, as being a Spirit, is inviſible to the bodily eyes of any, though ſome rayes of his glorious Majeſty have at ſome times been ſeen; nor can any creature take up the infinitely glorious eſſence of God with the eyes of their minde, but very Angels cover their faces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; Nor is there any knowledge of God at all attainable by men of themſelves, and what they ſee and know by revelation, is but as nothing in compariſon of what Chriſt hath: All this is imported in that, <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time,</hi> to wit, with bodily eyes, or fully as Chriſt doth, or without him. 2. Albeit God be inviſible and incomprehenſible by any of themſelves, yet there is a declaration and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of him to ſinful man, and a knowledge and ſight of him attainable in ſo farre as is neceſſary to ſalvation; for, ſo are we taught here, that God is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</hi> 3. As Chriſt perfectly ſeeth; and knoweth and comprehendeth the Father; ſo the declaration and manifeſtation of God to man, and eſpecially that which is ſaving and ſanctifying, is by Chriſt, who from the beginning of the world was the onely revealer of God to the Church; And eſpecially at his incarnation, he hath revealed the Father in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the knowledge of him and his will unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by his doctrine; for, <hi>the Sonne, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him.</hi> 4. Albeit God have many ſons by creation, (as Angels, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. and <hi>Adam, Luke</hi> 3.38.) and by adoption; yet he hath onely one natural Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his ſubſtance, by eternal and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible generation, who as he perfectly comprehendeth the Father, ſo he cannot but infallibly declare him, being the expreſſe image of his perſon; for, Chriſt is <hi>the onely begotten Sonne,</hi> and this is one ground of his declaring the Father. 5. Chriſt is one in eſſence with the Father, coexiſting with him from eternity, and is one with him in regard of familiarity and delight, and was and is upon all the Fathers counſels; And this doth yet further aſſure the Church of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what he declareth of God, and doth ſet out their happineſſe who have him for their friend and ſurety, who is ſo intimate with the Fathar; for, this is another ground of his declaring the Father, that he <hi>is in the boſome of the Father,</hi> which imports oneneſſe, intimacy and delight, that he hath a neere ſight, and intimate acquaintance with the Father.

                     <hi>Johns ſecond teſtimony after the Baptiſme of Chriſt, was given upon occaſion of Commiſſioners ſent unto him from the Councel at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in way of conference betwixt them and him;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48148:11"/>
Wherein, being poſed concerning his perſon and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he declares negatively that he was neither the Meſſiah, nor</hi> Elijah <hi>in proper perſon; nor that great Prophet they expected,</hi> ver. 19, 20, 21. Next, <hi>being further poſed, he declareth poſitively that he was Chriſts forerunner, of whom</hi> Iſaiah <hi>had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheſied,</hi> ver. 22, 23. Thirdly, <hi>being further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate concerning his office and adminiſtration of Baptiſme, he cleareth them in that,</hi> ver. 24, 25, 26, 27 Laſtly, <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> John <hi>ſubjoyneth the circumſtance of place where this teſtimony was given.</hi> ver, 28.</p>
                  <p>From theſe verſes wherein he declareth what he was not, <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Church Judicatories for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of Chriſts matters, and for trial of new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and opinions, are an approven Ordinance of God: And ſuch as are entruſted with that power, ought to go very gravely and tenderly to work, when providence puts them upon the trial of any ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent; for, theſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whom theſe Commiſſioners came, were their great Councel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of old by God for theſe matters; And their carriage in not condemning <hi>John</hi> untried and unheard, and their uſing of him reſpectively, in ſending grave men for deſcent, office (land of their moſt eminent ſect alſo, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 24.) to him, are rules of prudence, in ſuch procedure, worthy of imitation. 2. In a corrupt and declining time of the Church, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the teachers are furtheſt out of courſe, and are not with the firſt to enquire after Chriſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind many; for, notwithſtanding all <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine before Chriſts Baptiſme, yet it is after that ere the Councel of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> enquire after him or it, and but to little purpoſe then either, as the ſequel ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 3. Whatever be the purpoſes of corrupt men in enquiring after, or debating about truth; yet God can make uſe thereof to bring out more of his truth, and give occaſion to his ſervants, to publiſh it yet more; for, though theſe came rather to quarrel and jangle, then to be edified; yet it drew out a <hi>record of John,</hi> which is of uſe to the Church in all ages. 4. It is not onely requiſite that new doctrines be tried and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, but the authority of men who publiſh the ſame, not upon an ordinary call, nor in an ordinary way, is ſubject to trial alſo, and that in the firſt place; for, their firſt queſtion (which <hi>John</hi> holds himſelf bound to anſwer) is, <hi>who art thou?</hi> intimating, that if he were not an authorized perſon, he was bound to ceaſe. 5. It is the duty of truly godly men to walke reſpectively toward Church Judicatories appointed of God, even when ſuch as bear ſway in them are corrupt: nor ought they deny a teſtimony to the truth when they are called to it, and ſo long as there is any hope or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of doing good by it; for, <hi>John,</hi> though he was an extraordinary man, yet is content to give an account to the Commiſſioners of that corrupt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, ſeeing they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair; and by this means he doth confirme the truth for the good of others. 6. Viſible Churches and Councels, even ſuch as have moſt peculiar priviledges, may erre, and have erred; And that particularly, when they look more to tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to Scripture; for, theſe inſtructions do clear the Councel of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to have erred, in that they ſuppoſe the Meſſiah could be come (as <hi>Johns</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their firſt queſtion underſtands them) without a forerunner; In that they dreamed (following tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that <hi>Elijah</hi> was to come in proper perſon (for in that ſenſe onely <hi>John</hi> denieth that he was <hi>Elijah,</hi> though otherwiſe he was he, as coming in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Elijah, Matth.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.) And, in that they dreamed from <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15, 18. of any ſingular Prophet to be raiſed up after the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Prophets in the Old Teſtament, in the time of the Meſſiah, beſide the Meſſiah himſelf, to whom that paſſage is applied, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. and ſo <hi>John</hi> denieth that alſo, though otherwiſe he was <hi>a Prophet of the Higheſt, Luke</hi> 1.76. 7. As Gods ſervants in all their Teſtimonies ought to be plain, bold, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, ingenuous and conſtant; ſo in particular, they ought to be ingenuous and fervent in renouncing the honour due to their Maſter, not ſleeing from it for the faſhion onely, that it may follow them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Therefore <hi>he confeſſed, and denied not, but confeſſed I am not the Chriſt,</hi> not ſtanding on what they might do to him, not finding him to be ſo. 8. Such as come not to the Word to be edified, but to jangle and catch advantage, it is righteous with God to leave them lying in their errours and miſtakes, without clearings; Therefore, doth <hi>John</hi> not cleare their miſtakes concerning <hi>Elias,</hi> or the Prophet, nor clear in what ſenſe he was <hi>Elias,</hi> but nakedly anſwers their queſtions according to their apprehenſions of things.</p>

The reaſon which theſe Commiſſioners give for their ſo earneſt queſtioning of him, may teach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to be faithful in what is committed to his truſt, eſpecially in matters of publick concernment, relating to the Church of God; for, ſay they, <hi>Who art thou, that we may give an anſwer to them that ſent us?

Therefore came he with an Uſher and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, crying to prepare his way when he manifeſted himſelf; which is the prerogative of Kings, whereas private perſons will come in with leſſe noiſe, and at narrower paſſages. <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the voice of one crying, make ſtreight, &amp;c.</hi> 5.

                     </gap>epared for Chriſt to come into, which muſt be cured before he come; They are naturally averſe from the purity of true Religion; full of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of vanity, pride and ambition; valleys of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, diſcouragement, unbelief, and hollow-hearted hypocriſie; crookedneſſe and deceitfulneſſe in their hearts and wayes, whereby men deceive themſelves and others, and hide the need of Chriſt from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; roughneſſe of their paſſions, humours and luſts, ready to reject all warnings and offers: And all theſe make mens hearts an unſtreight way for Chriſts Chariot to march in; Therefore, cried <hi>John, make ſtreight the way of the Lord,</hi> under this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the making low of mountains, the exalting of valleys, &amp;c. of which <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. from <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.4. and turning the heart of the children to the fathers, &amp;c. of which <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16, 17. from <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5, 6. 6. As all men in all places are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unfit for receiving of Chriſt, ſo ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the offer of him is worſe entertained in places of eminency then in more obſcure corners; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is this proclamation made, not in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>in the Wilderneſſe;</hi> (or hill-countrey of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> where the inhabitants and Cities were fewer, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.61.) a place where he would more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be received then in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 7. Albeit that. Chriſt commands us to prepare his way, that he may ſhew us our duty, and make uſe of exhortations, as a meane whereby he works upon his own; Yet this work of preparation is not in our power, but muſt be his work, whole reward is with him, and his work before him. And unto ſuch as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of their own inability, he will firſt come with a work of converſion unto faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that this may make way for his coming with conſolation and ſenſible manifeſtation; Therefore, is this command ſweetned with a promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.4, 5.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Commiſſioners, ſeeking advantage, (as being no friends to the Goſpel) do queſtion <hi>John</hi> further concerning his office, and adminiſtration of Baptiſme, ſeeing he was neither the Meſſiah, nor any of theſe extraordinary men: To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that he pretended to no more then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the outward ordinance, the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whereof depended on Chriſt; And that he did this much becauſe he was the forerunner of Chriſt, who was already come, though yet unknown to them; And that Chriſt in his perſon and dignity was ſo farre above him, as he was not worthy to do him the meaneſt ſervice. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is an evidence of a ſick and corrupt Church, when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men are entruſted with moſt grave and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty employments in it; for, ſo was it with the Church of the Iewes, when <hi>they, which were ſent were of the Phariſees;</hi> A preciſe ſect, abounding in errour, ſuperſtition and hypocriſie, as the hiſtory of the Goſpel maketh manifeſt. 2. Corrupt men are more ready to jangle and lie at wait for advantages, then to embrace the truth of God delivered by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for, theſe Phariſees take no notice of what he had ſaid from <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> nor ſeek to be further cleared in it, but think they have an advantage of him, that he ſhould preſume to baptize. <hi>Why bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt &amp;c?</hi> 3. It was an uncontroverted truth, both among friends and foes, in the Jewiſh Church, that at the coming of the Meſſiah, there ſhould be ſome changes in the way of Religion, and an inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Ordinances; for, the Phariſees have nothing to ſay againſt his Baptiſme, if he were <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or the <hi>Prophet,</hi> their onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, <hi>Why baptizeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, neither that Prophet?</hi> And <hi>John's</hi> anſwer, <hi>I baptize, but there ſtandeth one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, &amp;c.</hi> importeth that he being Chriſts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, who was now come into the world, it was lawful for him to adminiſter this Sacrament. 4. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ought to arrogate no more unto themſelves, then to be Miniſters and diſpenſers of the external meanes of Word and Sacraments, leaving the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and efficacie thereof unto Chriſt entirely; And people ought ſo to be affected in coming to theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; Therefore, ſaith <hi>John, I baptize with water,</hi> not denying that Chriſt alſo baptized with water, nor yet denying that baptiſme adminiſtred by him was accompanied with Grace and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; but he onely compareth his perſon and office with Chriſts, and ſheweth that whatever grace came by the Sacrament adminiſtred by him, yet he was not the giver of it, but Chriſt onely, who had appointed him to diſpence the outward ſeale. 5. Chriſt may be among a people, and yet they who reckon themſelves very high in the Church, neither ſee him, nor know him; for, ſaith <hi>John there ſtandeth one among you,</hi> (not that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48148:12"/>
then at that time, for he came but the next day to him from the Wilderneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. but that he was come into the world, and converſant with the Jewes) <hi>whom ye know not.</hi> 6. It is the duty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and will be the care of ſuch as are faithful and zealous, to exalt and commend Chriſt at all occaſions, that men may fall in love with him; Therefore, doth <hi>John</hi> again repeat his doctrine, <hi>he it is who coming after me, is preferred before me, whoſe ſhooes latch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi> 8. The more high employment, and the more eminent gifts men have, and the more ready men are to eſteeme of them, the more will they abaſe themſelves, if they be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious, and be affected with the excellency of Chriſt; for, it is <hi>John,</hi> the greateſt among them that are born of women, and ſo much eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, and the fore-runner of Chriſt who thus abaſeth himſelf, <hi>he is preferred before me, whoſe ſhooes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi> 9. Albeit Chriſt, of free grace, do honour men with emi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nent employments under him, and particularly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel; Yet ſuch as know Chriſt and themſelves well, will not onely ſee that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the high employments they have, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to do the baſeſt ſervice to him; for, <hi>John</hi> ſaith not, I am unworthy to be his fore runner, though employed in that ſervice, but, <hi>whoſe ſhooes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe,</hi> which was a mean and baſe office.</p>

                     <hi>This is</hi> Johns <hi>third teſtimony concerning Chriſt after his Baptizme, given in Chriſts own preſence, when he returned to John after his tentations in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; wherein,</hi> firſt, <hi>he points out Chriſt as the true ſacrifice for expiating of ſin,</hi> ver. 29. Next, <hi>he again applieth his former doctrine concerning the Meſſiah, to this perſon,</hi> ver 30. Thirdly, <hi>he ſheweth how he came to know him, and thus to teſtifie of him, which was not upon any acquaintance by eye-ſight; but when he got Commiſſion for his Miniſtry, it was revealed to him that the Meſſiah was in the world, and to be manifeſted by him,</hi> ver. 31. <hi>and that he got a ſigne from God whereby to diſcerne the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, which was accompliſhed in this perſon,</hi> ver. 32, 33. <hi>vpon the ſight whereof he was encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Chriſt to be the Son of God,</hi> ver. 34.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe, <hi>John</hi> who had hitherto ſet forth Chriſt in the dignity and excellency of his office, doth now declare how he was to execute his office, and to bring about theſe benefits; which was by ſuffering; and therefore he points out Chriſt as the ſubſtance of the Paſſeover and daily Sacrifices, who by the merit and vertue of his death takes away the ſin of his own, both Jewes and Gentiles. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Faithful Miniſters, and ſuch as know Chriſt, will diminiſh nothing of his commendation, for any outward diſpenſations he may meet with; for, the occaſion of this teſtimony declareth, that when <hi>John</hi> was publiſhing the former teſtimonies, Chriſt was abſent, and particularly, under his tentations in the Wilderneſſe, as the Harmony maketh clear, and yet in the mean time he had been commending him. 2. Such as faithfully point out and commend Chriſt, he will give them occaſion to do it yet more, by becoming more familiar with them, that ſo they may make him better known; for, whereas <hi>John</hi> had preached Chriſt faithfully, <hi>the next day John ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him,</hi> and ſo will he do ſtill, though he come not any more in perſon. 3. As faithful Miniſters get more clear and renewed ſights of Chriſt, ſo they ought to improve thoſe diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by making him known yet more to others; for, when Chriſt cometh to <hi>John,</hi> he publiſheth a new teſtimony, and points out yet more of him. 4. It is no ſmall part of Chriſts excellencie in the eyes of loſt ſinners, that he was pleaſed to condeſcend to be a ſuffering and crucified Lord, whereby he purchaſeth unto them ſo great a good, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>amb of God,</hi> or, a ſacrifice for ſin. 5. The world without Chriſt, is lying in wickedneſſe under ſin, and under all that followeth upon it; under the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and the corruption of nature, under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power of actual ſin, and under the curſe and wrath of God for it; and the ſenſe of this is it which will make thoughts of a crucified Chriſt ſweet; for, ſo is ſuppoſed here, in theſe words, <hi>the ſinne of the world.</hi> 6. Mans miſery through ſin, and wrath for ſin, is ſuch, as he can onely be relieved from it by Chriſt the true ſacrifice for ſin; for, he is <hi>the Lamb of God who taketh away ſinne;</hi> And onely he, ſince the beginning of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. 7. The Legal Sacrifices and the Paſchal Lamb, were but types of Chriſt the true Sacrifice for ſin, and the ſubſtance of all they ſhadowed out,

is onely to be found in him, who was without ſpot and blemiſh; who is ſeparated from ſinners, as the Paſchal Lamb was ſet apart on the tenth day of the moneth; who expiates ſin by his death, which theirs did but typically; whoſe blood applied, doth quiet the conſcience, and turn away the curſe, as upon ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the blood of the Paſſeover, the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel paſſed over; who was content to be killed and roſted in the wrath of God, (as the Paſſeover was in the fire) that we might live, and he might be food for us; and, who was content to undergo all this meekly and patiently for our cauſe, Therefore is he called <hi>the Lamb,</hi> with relation ſpecially to the Paſſeover, and the Lambs employed for daily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and with relation to the properties of theſe beaſts, pointing out the way of his ſuffering, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.7. 8. Albeit the Paſchal Lamb, and Lambs for Sacrifice were Gods creatures, and appointed and enjoyned by God in the general for theſe typical uſes; Yet the chooſing out, and ſetting apart of ſuch as were moſt fit according to Gods direction, was mans work, and his judgment was interpoſed in it: But Chriſt the true Sacrifice, was ſingled out alanerly by God; who out of his infinite love to loſt man, did deſigne him for that work in his eternal counſel and the Covenant of redemption, when man had no way to help himſelf; who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated him from ſinners by ſpotleſſe ſanctification, to be a perfect Sacrifice; and, who ſent him out of his own boſome to accompliſh the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for theſe cauſes is he called <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> as his peculiar priviledge above theſe types. 9. Chriſt is the true Saviour who taketh the burden of ſin from off his people, and bears it himſelf, and by bearing of it, doth deſtroy and aboliſh it; This he did by his death in transferring the guilt of their ſin upon himſelf, and bearing the puniſhment and wrath due to it, by which he hath merited the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin away out of Gods ſight, and obtained a dominion over it; and this is made forth-coming to his people, partly by juſtification wherein the merit of Chriſts death is applied for taking away the guilt and puniſhment due to ſin, ſo as it ſhall not be inflicted, partly, by ſanctification, wherein the power of his death is applied for ſubduing and purging the filth of ſin, till the beleever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſpotleſſe; He is <hi>the Lamb of God which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away ſinne;</hi> or, taketh it oft them, beareth it himſelf, and taketh it quite away; for, the word will import all theſe. 10. The vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſts death doth expiate and take away the ſin of the univerſality of his elect throughout all the world, and is not reſtricted to Jewes only, as theſe typical ſacrifices were, but extended to all his elect among the Gentiles alſo; for, he <hi>taketh away the ſinne of the world,</hi> which is not to be underſtood of all and every man (for their ſinnes are not taken away) but of his own ſcattered through the world, and in all ages of it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, as taking in Gentiles as well as Jewes, as the word <hi>world</hi> is taken, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. Beſide, they may alſo be called <hi>the world,</hi> as being many in themſelves, as being in his eſtimation as good as all the world, and they who will one day be ſet apart from the reſt of the world, and make up a peculiar world of themſelves. 11. Chriſt, coming into the world for the redemption of loſt man, ought to be looked on as wonderful in his incarnation, ſufferings, and in the love from whence this flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and as rare and matchleſſe, there being no <hi>Immanuel</hi> but one, no love, no actions like his, and therefore much to be admired and eſteemed of; And all who would reap benefit by him, ought to turne their eyes off all other things, expecting no ſuch benefit from them in whole or in part, and fixe them onely on him: All theſe are imported in this duty to which <hi>John</hi> inviteth his hearers to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (or, <hi>ſee,</hi> and fixe our eyes upon) <hi>the Lamb of God.</hi>

Miniſters can never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be careful in ſetting out Chriſts excellencie, notwithſtanding any outward condition wherein he is; nor in putting away any honour due to Chriſt, when it ſeemeth to be given to them; nor in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying his eternal Godhead, and commending his excellency above all; becauſe of that; for, this is the ſumme of that doctrine which here again he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates; <hi>after me cometh a man, which is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi> 2. God doth approve in his ſervants, not fits and flaſhes, but fixedneſſe and conſtancie in their diſcerning Chriſt and his glory, in his loweſt eſtate; And they will finde no cauſe to repent, or eat in any honourable thoughts they have had of him; Therefore, doth <hi>John</hi> as no reed ſhaken with the winde, adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and again publiſh his former doctrine. 3. The ſame things ſpoken over and over again of Chriſt, will not be taſtleſſe to ſuch as know his excellencie; and truths often inculcate are the truths which we come ofteneſt ſhort in taking up; and yet ſhould ſtudy moſt; So much alſo doth <hi>Johns</hi> frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of this doctrine teach. 4. The dignity and excellencie of Chriſt as God, becometh comfortable to the Church, being found in our nature, by his becoming man and her kinſman, that he may do the duty of a kinſman and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to her. Therefore, doth <hi>John</hi> point him out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>a man; after me cometh a man, &amp;c.</hi> 5.

                  <p>Leſt any ſhould queſtion how <hi>John</hi> knew this perſon to be the Meſſiah whom he had preached; He declareth how he came to know him, and got ground for this teſtimony. And firſt, he declareth that when he entred upon his calling, he knew not Chriſt by face; or at leaſt, that he had not any converſe with him to know him to be the Meſſiah: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he knew by revelation, his offices, and that he was in the world, ſhortly to be manifeſted: And therefore he was ſent by the immediate call of God to preach his approach and being at hand, and by his Doctrine and Baptiſme to hold out the benefits to be had by him, having aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance alſo, that in the time of his Miniſtry, he ſhould have occaſion to point out his perſon to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as being his forerunner. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is an unjuſt calumnie and prejudice againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that what they ſay of Chriſt, is done but for by-reſpects; And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, there was no cauſe to ſuſpect theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meſſengers ſent to point out Chriſt, now come into the world, of any colluſion with him, or double-dealing; Therefore, God ſo ordered it, that, to prevent this, <hi>John,</hi> though a kinſman of Chriſts according to the fleſh, ſhould not know him, either not ſeeing him by face, or having no converſe with him. 2. A bodily ſight of Chriſt, or acquaintance with him outwardly, is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply needful for enabling a Miniſter to point him out ſavingly to the world: Albeit all the Apoſtles behoved to have been ſuch as had ſeen, and had converſed with him in the fleſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21, 22. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was raviſhed to the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſupply the want of ſeeing him in the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8. Yet even in the dayes of his fleſh, called men were able to preach him upon ſpiritual acquaintance by faith, though they had not ſeene nor known him in the fleſh; for, <hi>John</hi> was ſent <hi>to manifeſt him to Iſrael,</hi> when yet he <hi>knew him not.</hi> 3. Men called of God to the work of the Miniſtry, muſt not ſtand back becauſe of the conſcience of much inability, but ought to hazard on the call, expecting that their furniture ſhall grow upon their hands as they need it; for <hi>John</hi> is ſent not onely to preach Chriſt, but to point him out, when <hi>yet he knew him not,</hi> but had a promiſe that he ſhould know him, as afterward he did. 4. The chief end of the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments, is, to point out, and to make an unknown Chriſt, known to the world and the Church; for, <hi>that he ſhould be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to Iſrael, therefore, am I come baptizing with water. John</hi> had indeed a peculiar end in his Miniſtry, to preach that the Kingdome of God was at hand, that Chriſt was come in the fleſh, and to point him out in perſon: But the general end of the Miniſtry, in which he alſo joyned, is to point him out to faith, in his merit, vertue and efficacie. 5. Baptiſme with water is an Ordinance of God, wherein Chrſt is alſo held forth, as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord who is Sovereign Lord of the world, and may reveale Chriſt to whom he will, was pleaſed to make <hi>Iſrael</hi> his peculiar people, and to give unto them the firſt offer of Chriſt, and of all the priviledges of the Goſpel, that he might keep his promiſe made to their fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. and that he might leave a pledge of his fidelity, that no affection to the reſt of his ſheep, could make him break what he had ſaid; for, <hi>John</hi> was ſent, <hi>that he might be made manifeſt to Iſrael.</hi>

                     <hi>John</hi> declareth further, that he got a ſigne from God whereby he might know the true Meſſiah and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghoſt, which being accompliſhed on Chriſt at his Baptiſme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. did confirme <hi>John,</hi> and encourage him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime Chriſt to be the Sonne of God. Whereas <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. that he knew not Chriſt, it is not to be underſtood as if he knew him not at all, before the accompliſhment of that ſigne, for it is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13, 14 he knew him when he came to be baptized. But the meaning is, that when <hi>John</hi> entred to his Miniſtry, and got the promiſe of this ſigne, he knew not Chriſt by face, though afterward about the time of his Baptiſme, he knew him firſt by revelation, and was yet more confirmed by the accompliſhment of the promiſed ſigne. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The glorious evidences of Chriſts excellencie and Godhead, when he came into the world, are not cunningly deviſed fables; but moſt certaine and infallible truths; for, <hi>John bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſaying, I ſaw, &amp;c.</hi> He giveth a ſolemne teſtimony of it. 2. Chriſt in his ſolmne entry to his offices, was ſealed from heaven, and ſtated in them, that ſo the Church may learn to embrace him with all reſpect. Therefore doth the Spirit deſcend upon him in this viſible glorious way, and the Father beare witneſſe to him, as it is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. all the perſons of the Trinity manifeſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on <hi>Jordans</hi> bank. 3. Chriſt is endowed with the Spirit from on high for executing of his offices, and it is made manifeſt that the Spirit is to be found on him, and ſought from him; for, <hi>I ſaw
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48148:14"/>
the Spirit deſcending from heaven upon him,</hi> where the Spirit, who filleth heaven and earth, is ſaid to <hi>deſcend</hi> in reſpect of that viſible manifeſtation and ſigne of his preſence. 4. The Spirits deſcending <hi>like a dove,</hi> a meek, harmleſſe and affectionate creature, pointed out, what Chriſt is in his own nature to them that come to him, even meeke, harmleſſe, loving, and not dreadful; what he is in the execution of his office, even he in whom the Father is well pleaſed and pacified, and he who bringeth the good newes of aſſwaging the deluge of wrath, as <hi>Noahs</hi> dove of the drying up of the flood; And what he is in the operations of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon his people, that they are made meek, harmleſſe, and lowly as doves, not like birds of prey. 5. Albeit all Chriſts members do receive of the Spirit in their meaſure, yet it is Chriſts prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to have the Spirit reſting on him; Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God is the Spirit of one eſſence with him, proceeding from the Father and him, and ſo is ever preſent with him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> But even as man by vertue of the perſonal union, the Spirit floweth and reſteth on Chriſt, and efficaciouſly worketh in him all divine graces and vertues without meaſure, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, ſo that none can come wrong to him at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time for receiving of his Spirit: Therefore, it is ſaid, <hi>it abode upon him.</hi> See <hi>Iſa,</hi> 11.2, 3. 6. Chriſt in taking on our nature, did ſo cover his glory with the vaile of our fleſh and common infirmities, that he could not be known by bodily ſight from another man, without divine revelation, and evidences from God; for, without this, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I knew him not.</hi> See <hi>Matth</hi> 16.17. 7. The Lord is very tender and careful of his ſervants, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and confirme them in their calling and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; And will not faile to performe what he hath promiſed for that effect, when he ſendeth them out; for, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, he ſaw this ſigne in a peculiar way, as being to him an accompliſhment of that promiſe given to him; for, God had ſaid to him, <hi>upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending, &amp;c.</hi> and now it was accompliſhed. 8. The Spirit reſteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and was manifeſted to be on him by a viſible ſigne, not onely for himſelf, and to point out his ezcellency, but for the Churches good, and to certifie them that he received the Spirit to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto them, either extraordinarily, when need required, or ordinarily, to work that inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Spirit, which Baptiſme ſcaleth and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; for, this ſigne ſerved to point out that Chriſt is <hi>be which baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which is ſpoken, partly, with relation to the extraordinary pouring out of his Spirit after his Aſcention, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. partly, with relation to the external Ordinance of Baptiſme adminiſtred by <hi>John</hi> and others, whereof he onely can give the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when by his Spirit he ſanctifieth and cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beleever. 9. Albeit that extraordinary ſignes and wonders be not now needful to confirme the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſo oft confirmed already; Yet every Miniſter, would be ſure grounded in what they teſtifie to be the minde of God, and what they know of Chriſts excellency, they would not hide nor conceale it; So much may be learned from <hi>John's</hi> way, who <hi>ſaw, and bare record.</hi> 10. This truth, that Jeſus the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is alſo the Sonne of God in the ſame perſon, was confirmed by infallible evidences, and by eye and eare witneſſes; for, <hi>I ſaw, and bare record that this is the Sonne of God.</hi> See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. 11. It is not enough to receive Chriſt as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently endowed for the diſcharge of his offices; but to receive and beleeve in him as the Sonne of God by eternal generation, as being the ground-ſtone of our ſalvation, of our comfort, peace and ſtrength; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> hold him out not onely as <hi>the Baptizer with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but as <hi>the Sonne of God.</hi> See 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.5.</p>

Chriſts faithful ſervants will make conſcience to exalt him, and to lead people to him, and not to themſelves, And that not onely in publick, where many may obſerve, but even in their moſt private converſe, it will be their care that ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them moſt, may be led from them to Chriſt. Therefore <hi>John,</hi> even in private with two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is ſo careful to point out Chriſt. 3 A ſight of Chriſt is not onely an occaſion, but a notable help to enable Miniſters to preach and point him out to others; for, as <hi>John looking upon Jeſus as he walked,</hi> is encouraged to commend him, ſo a ſight and enjoyment of his ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, will notably furniſh men to ſpeak of him. 4. It is the duty of faithful Miniſters, to be much in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt crucified, and pointing him out as the onely propitiatory ſacrifice for ſin, as being a chief point of Chriſtian knowledge, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mean of converſion; therefore doth <hi>John</hi> again point him out as ſuch, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God.</hi>

As the doctrine of Chriſt, as a ſacrifice for ſin, is ſweet to ſuch as are trained in the ſchool of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples were; So this doctrine is the chief inſtrument of converſion: Whatever other divine doctrine men receive, it will but turne them Moraliſts, unleſſe they alſo receive and embrace the doctrine of Chriſt crucified, and himſelf ſo held out in it, to make them Chriſtians indeed; for, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lamb of God,</hi> was the doctrine they <hi>heard him ſpeak,</hi> which wrought upon them. 3. Such as do rightly hear Chriſt preached, will never get reſt till they attaine to ſome more acquaintance with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; The heart touched by the Word, is ſet on work to follow after and ſeek communion with him, and for this end, will miſſe and follow after him, never reſting till they get him; So much are we taught by theſe diſciples practice, <hi>they heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus.</hi> 4. Chriſt taketh notice, and knoweth wel-enough who they are that follow him, although his back ſeeme to be toward them; for, his <hi>turning,</hi> and ſeeing them follow, importeth, that he knew they were behinde him. 5. Albeit Chriſt ſeeme to go away from theſe who follow him, and let them follow awhile that ſo he may ſtirre them up, and exerciſe and diſcover their faith the more: Yet ere all be done, he will turn and manifeſt himſelf unto them: ſo much are we taught by this practice, <hi>Jeſus turned and ſaw them following.</hi> 6. Such as follow Chriſt would very ſeriouſly try and enquire their end in ſo doing; Whether it be eaſe and outward things, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, Chriſt at firſt propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Queſtion, <hi>What ſeek ye?</hi>

                     </gap>s needful to be anſwered, and till then he keeps a diſtance. 7. One right end of ſeeking to Chriſt, is, out of the ſenſe of our ignorance and errours, to employ him to be our ſouls Maſter and Teacher, who can infallibly and effectually inſtruct. So much may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that title they give him; They ſay unto him, <hi>Rabbi, which is to ſay being interpreted, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> or, <hi>Teacher.</hi> 8. Such as have any ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt will uſe meanes to be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him; And ſuch as come to him for right ends will not have ſoone done their errands with him, nor get enough of him; So much is imported in their anſwer; <hi>Where dwelleſt thou?</hi> as minding to have more familiar acquaintance with him, then to get a little information by the way onely. 9. Such as ſeek Chriſt for himſelf, will get warme invitations and entertainment from him at laſt; And as they are not willing to have ſoone done with Chriſt, ſo he will finde meanes to hold them on with him; for, <hi>be ſaith unto them, come and ſee,</hi> he doth not tell them, that they might come when they liked, but draweth them along with him: And if we take it up ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, it imports, That his ſincere followers will be made to know by experience the place where his honour dwelleth, by taſting of the bleſſing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, till they come to dwell with him for ever. And, That they can better take up theſe things by ſeeing and experience, then by any report. 10. When Chriſt giveth invitations, it is wiſdome in his people to embrace the offer, and not to ſit their time, when either the Word, or the lively operation of the Spirit with it, is calling and alluring their hearts; for, upon his call, <hi>they came and ſaw where he dwelt</hi> 11. Such as follow Chriſts call, may not onely get what good they expect, but his providence may caſt unex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pected benefits in their way; for, <hi>they abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour,</hi> or, (according to the Jewes calculation, who divided every day into twelve hours, which therefore were longer in Summer, and ſhorter in winter) two hours before night. They came onely to know the place of his abode, but providence ordered, that they got a nights lodging with him, that they might learn more of him.</p>

Such as have gotten any knowledge of Chriſt, and are brought in to him, ought to be careful to invite others unto him: And albeit ſuch as are unrenewed may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of converſion to others (otherwiſe we ſhould hear none in faith of a bleſſing to that Ordinance, ſince we cannot be infallibly certain of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of any) yet ſuch as are converted, will be moſt zealous that way, and ordinarily are moſt ſucceſſeful; Therefore, doth <hi>Andrew,</hi> being now called, ſeek <hi>Simon,</hi> and bring him to Chriſt. 2.

                     </gap>y eminent ones; for, <hi>Peter,</hi> the great Apoſtle, is called by <hi>Andrew.</hi> 4. Kindneſſe begins on Chriſts ſide, and his grace doth prevent the ſinner; for, <hi>Andrew</hi> the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Peters</hi> good, <hi>firſt findeth his own brother,</hi> which importeth he was ſeeking him, and did finde him before he dreamed of ſo good newes 5. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the Meſſiah promiſed in the Old Teſtament, whom the Prophets and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked for, ſo doth <hi>Andrew</hi> reckon, <hi>we have the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> implied alſo that he and his brother had been of theſe who looked for him. 6. The finding of Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah, is good newes indeed, and the moſt excellent of purchaſes, as making the finder eternally happy; for, theſe are the good news that went among them, <hi>we have found the Meſſias.</hi> 7. It is the will of God that his minde in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be not hid up in a dark language, but that it be made plain and intelligible to all who ſeek the way of ſalvation therein; Therefore, is the Hebrew word <hi>Meſſias,</hi> interpreted, <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> in Greek, in which the New Teſtament was written for the uſe both of Gentiles and Jewes, as being then a common language, ſo alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 38.42. 8. The titles and ſtiles given to Chriſt in Scripture are not to be lightly paſſed over, but pondered, what may be held out in them for our edification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; And particularly, that he hath taken to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the title of being the anointed one by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without meaſure, for the diſcharge of all his offices for the Churches good; therefore alſo is his name, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>the Anointed,</hi> interpreted in Greek <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> ſignifying the ſame. 9. Whatever is wanting in the light of Inſtruments pointing out Chriſt, will be made up if the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er go to Chriſt himſelf; And faithful Preachers will not be at eaſe till they draw hearers to Chriſt, and hearers ſhould be tractable when means are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and not reſt up in any mans word, but go to Chriſt themſelves; for, <hi>Andrew</hi> having little more to ſay, drawes him to Chriſt, and <hi>Peter</hi> goeth with him, <hi>he brought him to Jeſus.</hi> 10. Chriſt doth perfectly know all that come to him, and what concerns them, and this he diſcovereth, that they may be encouraged to employ him in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igents, and may walk before him as an heart ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; Therefore, <hi>when Jeſus beheld him, he ſaid, thou art Simon, &amp;c.</hi> At firſt view he lets him ſee he knew him. 11. Chriſt will welcome theſe that come to him, whoever were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their converſion, nor will he deſpite them for their outward mean condition; for, he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Peter,</hi> though called by the private inſtruction of <hi>Andrew,</hi> as well as theſe who were called by <hi>John,</hi> and that albeit he was poor <hi>Simon the ſonne of</hi> fiſher <hi>Jona.</hi> 12. Such as come to Chriſt he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them a new nature, and admits them into his family as children; for, his giving him a new name, imports he was now a borne childe in his family, and he his Father. 13. Whatever dignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Chriſt conferre upon his converts, yet he would have them not forgetting what they are of themſelves, that this may ſtill keep them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and commend Chriſts grace the more; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the promiſe he puts him in minde, that <hi>he is Simon the ſonne of Jona.</hi> 14. As conſtancie and firmneſſe in the truth and profeſſion thereof in variety of times and trials, is a commendable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; ſo the diſpenſation of the meaſures of faith whereby profeſſors are ſtronger or weaker, are in Chriſts own hand; And it is not onely beleevers duty to be firme, but Chriſts promiſe alſo, who undertakes to make them ſuch ſo farre as he ſeeth it meet; for, the thing ſignified by this name, <hi>Sephas,</hi> or, <hi>a Stone</hi> is conſtancy as <hi>Peters</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and Chriſt by giving him this name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh to make him ſo. 15. The Lord doth not meaſure nor judge of his ſervants by their fits of weakneſſe, but by the conſtant tenour of their way; And in great mercy, he giveth confirmations to his own, whom he is to try, that when their weakneſſe appeareth, they may not loſe hope; for, Chriſt calleth <hi>Simon, Cephas,</hi> or a fixed beleever, notwithſtanding his ſlips that followed, and by this name would ſore-arme him againſt diſcouragement therefrom.</p>

Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference and mutual edification is a notable means for advancing the Kingdom of Chriſt in our ſelves or others; for, by theſe means Chriſt gathereth his diſciples here. 3. The Meſſiah was ſpoken of and foretold, both in the Law and in the Prophets, and the godly before his coming, waited for him by ſtudying theſe Scriptures; And Jeſus is the true Meſſiah, in whom all things that were foretold are accompliſhed, the finding of whom is the beſt of newes; for theſe are <hi>Philips</hi> newes to <hi>Nathaneel, We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law and the Prophets did write,</hi> importing, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did write of him, as is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and 49.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. and frequently through the Prophets; import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, that <hi>Philip, Nathaneel,</hi> and other godly men were verſed in the Scriptures, point him out, and fed upon him as held forth in the Word, and that the finding of him now in perſon was joyful newes unto them. 4. Such as are true Converts and love Chriſt, may yet be very weak in knowledge, yea, and erre alſo, eſpecially when any thing of Chriſt is learned from tradition, or vulgar report, and not from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for, ſo doth <hi>Philip</hi> miſtake in calling him <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth,</hi> if it be taken for the place of his birth, and not of his education, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23. and, <hi>the ſon of Joſeph,</hi> as the common report was. 5. Men are naturally ready to ſtumble at ſomething of Chriſt, yea, even good men may have prejudices to marre their own growth &amp; progreſſe; for, <hi>Nathaneel</hi> ſtumbleth at the place, <hi>Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> not ſo much becauſe Chriſt muſt be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as becauſe of the baſeneſſe of the place, the inhabitants of <hi>Galilee</hi> where <hi>Nazareth</hi> was, being a blockiſh and groſſe people; ſo that it was generally conceived, no Prophet could ariſe from thence. <hi>John</hi> 7.52.

Albeit all who came of <hi>Jacob</hi> after the fleſh, were Iſraelites in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Court, yet all that were ſo by viſible Covenant, were not ſuch inwardly, and in the inward Court of God; And Chriſt is a diſcerner both of the one and the other, who cannot be deceived; Therefore, ſaith he of <hi>Nathaneel Behold, an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> or <hi>truly,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that many were not truly ſuch, or in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 4. The true mark of a true Iſraelite in the ſpirit, is, not perfection or ſinleſneſſe, but ſincerity, whereby men having gotten grace, and cloſed with Chriſt, and applied the vertue of his blood, are enabled to ſerve God from right principles, and for right ends; and are in ſo far purged from hypocriſie and diſſimulation, that it doth not reigne in them, but they love truth, and hate guile, they labour to be in reality and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, what they ſeem to others to be, they are jealous of the unſoundneſſe of their own hearts, and daily vexed with it; they ſet againſt all by ends in Religion, and aime at perfection in it; Thus was <hi>Nathaneel, an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite indeed, in whom is no guile,</hi> to wit, reigning or approven. 5.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of hearts, is ſuch as will ſtrike theſe who attain unto it, with admiration and wonder; for, ſaith <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> ſurprized with this encounter; <hi>Whence knoweſt thou me?</hi> as little dreaming how Chriſt could know him, and eſpecially his heart and inſide, ſeeing he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen him before. 7. Confuſed and ſurprizing thoughts concerning Chriſt, ought not to be reſted on, but the knowledge of him ought to be dived fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into, till we get diſtinct ſatisfaction; for, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaneel</hi> doth not reſt here, but dives into the matter, <hi>Whence knoweſt thou me?</hi> that he might know whence this knowledge came, and how he ſhould be affected with it; and Chriſt anſwereth him, to give proof of his willingneſſe to ſatisfie modeſt enquiries. 8. Chriſts Omniſcience and perfect knowledge of all things, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, theſe things that concern his people; is ſuch, as when he hath diſcovered ſo much as may make men wonder, he hath yet more to diſcover if he pleaſe; for, Chriſt tells <hi>Nathaneel</hi> how he knew yet more of him, <hi>Before that Philip called thee, &amp;c.</hi> A ſight of this did overcome <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139.1.— 6. 9. Chriſt hath an eye upon his people, before that any inſtrument deal with them, to draw them unto him, from whence it is that inſtruments fall upon them and are ſucceſſeful; for, Chriſt condeſcends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on this to <hi>Nathaneel</hi> before <hi>that Philip cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee, I ſaw thee.</hi> 10 Chriſts Omniſcience as God, and his Providence about all things, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about his people, doth condeſcend to very mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things, even poſtures of the body, circumſtances of time and place, and by this he would aſſure them of his taking notice of greater things that may concern them; for, ſaith he, <hi>Before that Philip called thee, when thou waſt under the fig-tree, I ſaw thee</hi> 11. As a ſincere heart, through Gods bleſſing, will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction concerning Chriſt, and be gained to him; ſo the kindly fruit of ſuch a work, is, to beget an high eſtimation of Chriſt; for, <hi>Nathaneel</hi> is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and his ſatisfaction brings out a faire confeſſion and commendation of Chriſt. 12. The more a ſoul know of Chriſt, it will not only eſteem him, but think and ſpeak the more reverently of him and to him; therefore doth <hi>Nathaneel</hi> call him <hi>Rabbi,</hi> which he did not before. 13. Chriſts All-ſeeing eye is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof of his Godhead, whereby he knoweth all things of himſelf, which every one would ſtudie who embrace and cloſe with him; for, whereas <hi>Philip</hi> had called him, <hi>the ſon of Joſeph,</hi> v. 45. <hi>Nathaneel</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of more from what he heard; <hi>Thou art the Son of God,</hi> and as ſuch a one cloſeth with him. 14. That which maketh Chriſts Godhead comfortable to his people, is that as Mediatour, and by vertue of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they have a peculiar intereſt in him; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that he is a King unto them, who will employ his divine power to ſubject them to his Government, and to protect and defend them, therefore <hi>Nathaneel</hi> ſubjoyneth, <hi>Thou art the King of Iſrael.</hi> We need not enquire whether by <hi>Iſrael</hi> he underſtand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, being yet ignorant of the extent of Chriſts Kingdom, or all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God alſo, ſeeing the truth in that point is elſewhere ſufficiently cleare to us.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48148:16"/>
is the Opener of heaven, and the way to it; who reacheth to heaven in his divine Original, and to earth in his manhood, and whom Angels ſerve. But it ſeemeth more ſafe to take it literally, for ſome ſignes of his glory manifeſted to ſome, that by their Miniſtry, it might be publiſhed to all; And as before this, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had been opened at his Baptiſme, <hi>Matth</hi> 3. And Angels aſcended and deſcended as he had ſervice for them, and particularly, at the publication of his birth, and in the time of his tentation in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo afterward heaven was in a ſorr opened at his Transfiguration and Aſcenſion, and Angels miniſtred to him in his Agonie, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion; We may alſo ſafely conceive, that this might have been yet more literally accompliſhed, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, though the accompliſhment be not recorded, as many other particulars were not, <hi>John</hi> 20.30, 31. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt is really well pleaſed with the faith and converſion of any, and would have them to look on it as no common benefit; And he is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed the more eaſie termes we beleeve upon, when we beleeve though we ſee not, or againſt ſenſe; or cloſe with him, notwithſtanding mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difficulties; for, ſaith Chriſt, admiring and commending his own grace in him, <hi>becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree, beleeveſt thou?</hi> 2. As Chriſt hath ſtill more and more proofs of himſelf, to give for confirmation of our faith, as we need; So they who are willing to beleeve on leſſe apparent grounds, ſhall be more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſee ſtill greater cauſe of beleeving; for, this is Chriſts promiſe to <hi>Nathaneel; Thou ſhalt ſee greater things then theſe.</hi> 3. The encouragements allowed by Chriſt to particular beleevers, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and recorded for the comfort of all beleevers in the like need, and following the ſame way; for, ſo is this promiſe given, <hi>he ſaid unto him, I ſay unto you,</hi> that is, to all then preſent. Even parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular extraordinary promiſes made to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, do allow general comfort to all beleevers in an ordinary way, though they are not to expect what is extraordinary: So much appeareth from <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. 4. Chriſts promiſes would be looked on as ſure and infallible; being not onely promiſed by him, who cannot lie, but moſt gravely aſſerted for our confirmation. And we ought to be humbled for our infidelity, which ſo readily miſtruſt; him, and to admire his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent condeſcendencie to ſatisfie our weakneſſe; Therefore, Chriſt prefixeth to this promiſe, <hi>verily, verily I ſay unto you,</hi> a grave and vehement aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration putting the matter beyond all doubt and controverſie. Not that this maketh the promiſe any ſurer on his part; but that our weakneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief needeth it, and he condeſcends unto it, and having given this aſſurance, expects abſolute and entire credit to what he ſaith. 5. The ſight of Chriſts glory is the great encouragement and ground of beleevers confirmation, as being all for them and their good, and letting them ſee what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency there is in him to be relied upon; Therefore is there a promiſe of <hi>Nathaneels</hi> confirmation by ſeeing more of Chriſts glory. 6. Chriſt our Mediator is approved from heaven, and he by whom heaven, formerly ſhut againſt ſinners, is opened; for, it is a part of Chriſts glory, that <hi>heaven is open</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, teſtifying an approbation of him, and his acceptance for him and his. 7. It doth alſo illuſtrate Chriſts glory, and further confirme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers faith, that Chriſt is Lord of Angels even in his ſtate of humiliation, and hath them ready at his call, as he or his people ſhall need their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for, it is alſo promiſed they ſhall <hi>ſee the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man;</hi> or, moving from earth to heaven, and from heaven to earth as he required. 8. All this glory of Chriſt is further comfortable, when he is found dwelling in our nature with it, yea and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in this his condeſcendence, and to be our kinſman, for, it is promiſed they ſhould ſee all this <hi>upon the Sonne of man,</hi> ſhewing that the Son of God was alſo the Sonne of man, and that he delighted to be ſo, and therefore doth ſo often take this title to himſelf.</p>

                  <p>In recording this firſt miracle of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> begins with three occaſions thereof; The firſt and remoteſt is, a marriage-feaſt, which is deſcribed from the place <hi>Cana,</hi> a village of <hi>Galilee</hi> lying at leaſt within a dayes journey to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>John</hi> 4.46, 50, 52. Called, <hi>of Galilee,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from another <hi>Cana,</hi> or, <hi>Kanab,</hi> in the tribe of <hi>Aſher, Joſh,</hi> 19.24, 28. which lay farther off from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> being near <hi>Zidon:</hi> It is alſo deſcribed from the time of it, which was the third day, to wit, after the former conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. or after his coming into <hi>Galilee,</hi> of which <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 43. The ſecond and nearer occaſion is, that Chriſts mother was there; (being, as appeareth, a friend to ſom of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48148:17"/>
in that it is not ſaid ſhe was invited, and ſhe is ſolicitous for the want of wine, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and hath ſome power with the ſervants, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.) and that Chriſt and his diſciples were invited to it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts practice, being now to enter on his publick Miniſtry, teacheth us not to paſſe away time, but to be frequently about the employments of our calling; for, he lets few dayes paſſe but he is manifeſting himſelf openly by word and work. 2. In Chriſts account Marriage is an honourable Ordinance, to which he will not deny his preſence and countenance; for, he is at this Marriage, and honoureth it with his firſt miracle. 3. Feaſting, and better faire then ordinary, and calling of friends together at marriage, are lawful, providing the rules of ſobriety, preſcribed in the Word to ſuch feaſts, be obſerved: And it is not againſt Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in any perſon to countenance their kindred or friends in marriage-feaſt; for, <hi>there was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> or <hi>marriage-feaſt,</hi> (as the word importeth) wherein they had wine, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>and the mother of Jeſus was there, and both Jeſus was called, and his diſciples,</hi> and they came. 4. Albeit men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now have alike occaſion of inviting Chriſt, yet this practice may minde us, 1. That married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do need, and ſhould ſeek Chriſts preſence to their marriage. 2. Men in marriage-feaſting ought ſo to carry themſelves in the uſe of their liberty, as they might invite Chriſt to it, and not to take ſuch prophane liberty, as may provoke him not to countenance them. 3. Such as would be kinde to Chriſt, and welcome him, ought to prove! it by their kindneſſe to his diſciples alſo. 4. Chriſts working a miracle upon this occaſion; teacheth, that in our moſt chearful and free times, we would be ſtill mindful of doing all to Gods glory, and not omit any occaſion of honouring him.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third and neareſt occaſion of this miracle, is, the want of wine, occaſioned, as would appear, rather through their poverty, and that ſome of their gueſts, (and belike Chriſt and his diſciples new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to the countrey) had not been expected, then through any exceſſe. Unto this is ſubjoyned the miracle it ſelf, in recording whereof <hi>John</hi> ſets down what paſt betwixt ſeveral parties, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to it, and manifeſtation of it; and firſt we have, by way of preparation, <hi>Maries</hi> part with Chriſt, and his anſwer; She being ſenſible of the want, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting (as ſhould ſeem) her kinsfolks credit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving known many things of her Sonne, partly by the Angels intimation at his conception, partly by what <hi>Simion,</hi> and <hi>Janna,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt had ſaid of him, if not alſo by his own private information during his private life, that he was ſhortly to manifeſt himſelf by doctrine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: She, I ſay, knowing this, doth repreſent the matter unto him for remedy: But he judging of her diſcourſe by her ſecret thoughts, doth ſharply reprove her for thinking to uſurpe power over him in the works proper to his Godhead, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his office, and for preſcribing of times to him wherein to work, though he were otherwiſe willing to do the thing. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Such is Chriſts tenderneſſe, that he doth not diſcover wants, that he may leave men in miſery, but that he may take occaſion to let the riches of his power, providence, mercy and help be ſeen; for, their <hi>wanting wine,</hi> whatever cauſe it ſlowed from, was the occaſion of this miracle. 2. Very lawful ſuits and requeſts to Chriſt may be ill managed, and propounded; And there may be great ill in Saints wayes, then they are aware of, or do ſee; for it was a very lawful courſe to go with needs to Chriſt, and yet he findeth matter of reproof in her ſo doing: and Albeit <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſeeme to deale very ſubmiſſively, in telling the need, <hi>they have no wine,</hi> without preſcribing, yet Chriſt, who underſtood the ſecret thoughts of her heart, findeth great preſumption in it; So <hi>Peter</hi> little dreamed that Satan ſhould borrow his tongue in wiſhing well to his Maſter, till himſelf told it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22, 23. 3. Such is Chriſts vigilancy, and zeal, and tenderneſſe, that at be diſcovereth, ſo he will not beare with faults in thoſe that are deareſt to him; for, he faileth not to reprove his own mother. 4. Albeit <hi>Mary</hi> was bleſſed among women in being the mother of Chriſt, yet was ſhe not free of ſin, not onely Original, but even of actual out-breakings; for, ſeeing Chriſt, who could not erre, reproveth her, ſhe is not faultleſſe. And this is regiſtrate in Scripture, to prevent mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting of that bleſſed woman above what is meer. 5. It is an affront offered to Chriſts glory, to think that <hi>Maries</hi> motherhood gave her any power over him, to direct him in works wrought by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, or in works of his office of Mediator, or to employ her for that end; for, his reproof tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ſecret preſumption in her ſelf, while as he who was ſubject to her, as man, during his private life, as to a mother, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51. doth now ſay unto her, <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> not <hi>mother,</hi> as accounting her to have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly authority in the matter of his office; and, <hi>What have I to do with thee?</hi> thou haſt nothing to do to meddle by any motherly power, for as a (ſupplicant ſhe might) with what I do now in my publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, not ſo much as to obtain a miracle of me. 6. Chriſts ſaddeſt reproofs of his people, for their miſcarriages in coming to him, ought not to put them out of hope that he will reſpect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all neceſſities in due time, as he ſeeth meet; for, though Chriſt thus reprove; yet the laſt part of it, <hi>mine hour is not yet come,</hi> importeth that it would come, yea, and that he had been waiting for it, and thinking on the matter before ſhe ſpake. 7. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when Chriſt is about to manifeſt himſelf; yet our time wherein we would have him work, and his time wherein he will work, are often very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; We are haſty, and would be through ſtraits without any humbling exerciſe and trial of graces;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48148:17"/>
But Chriſt looks on theſe fruit as better then ſimple out-gate, and our preſuming to preſcribe to him, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproof; for, <hi>mine hour is not yet come,</hi> ſaith he, reproving <hi>Mary,</hi> who would have had an out-gate already. 8. Whatever our deſires be under wants, yet Chriſt will not manifeſt his help, when it would pleaſe us beſt, but when his glory in working may be beſt ſeen, and particularly, when our emptineſſe without his help is moſt ſenſibly ſeen; for, <hi>when wine began to be ſcant,</hi> (as the words will beare) and was ſparingly diſtributed, was the fitteſt time in <hi>Maries</hi> account, for keeping the Bridegroomes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and hiding the want; but Chriſts <hi>hour was not come,</hi> till the want was better known and felt, and by his ſo doing, he looks more to the ſetting forth of his own glory, then to ſaving the credit of a creature.</p>

                  <p>Secondly; by way of preparation to the miracle; <hi>Maries</hi> part with the ſervants is recorded, She ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the reproof, and being humbled, and yet gathering hope from what he ſaid; directeth the ſervants to give ſimple and abſolute obedience to Chriſts directions, that ſo they might not fall in her fault, and he might do the work. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As we are not to think of <hi>Mary</hi> above what is meet, ſo we are not to run on another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, in not thinking reverently of her, and as becometh; for, <hi>John</hi> notwithſtanding of Chriſts ſharp word, calleth her Chriſts <hi>mother</hi> ſtill. 2. It is an evidence of a truly gracious heart, and of one that ſinneth of ignorance or infirmity, and not of pride or obſtinacie, that it taketh with a reproof from Chriſt, and humbly ſubmitteth to it; for, ſo doth <hi>Mary,</hi> in not anſwering again, though ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved. 3. As Chriſt by reproving his peoples faults, taketh not away ground of hope that he will do them good; So it is the mark of one who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth kindly with a reproof, that their humility hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth them not to take advantage, and grip to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may give hope; whereas proud diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is ready, under a pretence of humility, to caſt away all ground of hope when it is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for, humbled <hi>Mary</hi> her ſpeech to the ſervants, importeth that ſhe gathered from Chriſts word, ſome ground of hope, which ſhe laid hold on. 4. Such do take rightly with a reproof, and do prove that they are bettered by it, who do labour to prevent the ill they have fallen in, in others as well as in themſelves; for, ſo doth <hi>Maries</hi> direction to the ſervants teach, that ſhe would have them humble and ſubmiſſive, and not to preſcribe. 5. Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ought to be the rule of our actions, to which we ought to give ſimple, implicit and abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without queſtioning or murmuring; and the beſt way to come ſpeed at Chriſts hands, is to give him all his will by ſubmiſſion, eſpecially in things outward, and in the time, manner and meaſure of giving ſpiritual things alſo: providing that in things outward, we do not pretend to ſubmiſſion onely out of deſigne, to get our will; And in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that our ſubmiſſion flow not from careleſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and produce not negligence in the uſe of meanes; but that it be a fruit of faith and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a guard to keep the heart from fretting, when it hath done duty; This ſubjection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is held forth in <hi>Maries</hi> direction, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaith unto you, do it</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>John recordeth</hi> Chriſts part with the ſervants, which is contained in two directions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt, and their obedience. The firſt is, to fill up ſome great veſſels (uſed by them for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water for purifying themſelves) with water, which they did: And this was by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the miracle. The ſecond is, to draw out and carry this wine to the governour of the feaſt, whoſe skill was beſt, and his ſenſes moſt entire; which they alſo obey; And this direction preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the miracle wrought by his ſecret power, and their obedience maketh way to the manifeſting of it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. <hi>This manner of the purifying of the Jewes,</hi> for which they had the <hi>water-pots,</hi> to have water ſtill in readineſſe, whether it be underſtood of purifications enjoyned by the Law, or of the multiplyed waſhings brought in among them by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.3, 4, &amp;c. doth teach; That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and ſuch as have loſt the life of Religion, may yet be unwilling to quit all ſhew of Religion, but may hold up external ceremonies, yea may be ready then to multiply them moſt, as quieting any thing of a natural conſcience that is left, and as being very eaſie, and craving no inward exerciſe of the heart; for, ſo was <hi>the manner of the Jewes,</hi> in their declining times. 2. It is not in vaine to wait for any thing Chriſt giveth hope of by his Word, for he will make it good in due time; As here, the want of wine is ſupplyed by miracle, of which he gave ſome hope by his ſpeech to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. Chriſt doth not deceive people in the good turnes he doth for them, but they are all real, and every circumſtance of them being marked, doth confirme the ſame, and ſet out his glory; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are the circumſtances ſo narrowly marked, to ſet out his glory, in proving that there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the miracle; the <hi>water-pots,</hi> and not hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheds, where wine dregs might have given ſome reliſh to water, do prove there was no jugglery;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48148:18"/>
their matter, being <hi>of ſtone,</hi> not capable of the ſent of former liquor, confirmeth the ſame; their great capacity prevented ſuſpition of ſtealing in of wine, which might have been ſuſpected of leſſer veſſels; his employing of the ſervants, and not his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, takes off any ſuſpition of colluſion; his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Ruler, or orderer of the feaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as taſting it himſelf, ſhewed how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he was of the thing. 4. Where ever Chriſt cometh, he is worthy of his own roome, and doth liberally recompence any entertainment he, or his receive from any; for, whether his preſence and his diſciples (being beyond the number of gueſts expected) occaſioned the want or not; yet he payed his dinner well with abundance of wine in <hi>ſix wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pots, containing two or three firkins apiece.</hi> 5. Miracles wrought by Chriſt for confirming his doctrine, were ſuch works as were uſeful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to men; ſuch as this here. Whereby he would condemn ſuch as boaſt of idle and uſeleſſe miracles, ſerving for no profit, which favour not of Chriſt, not of power from him, nor of his doctrine, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them; And by this alſo he would prove himſelf to be the merciful Saviour of ſinners, in that he manifeſts himſelf to be God by theſe works and the like, when he might have proved it by ſad judgments on ſinners. 6. It is no difficultie for Chriſt to work the greateſt work he pleaſeth, and to make a change from worſe to better; for, this miracle is wrought immediately by his Godhead, without ſo much as a word, only he bids them fill water and draw wine. 7. Chriſt, in his deepeſt humiliation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement, is full of Majeſtie, and he knoweth how to get inſtruments to do him ſervice when he pleaſeth; yea, he can bow their hearts, who in appearance know nothing of him, to be foot and hand for his work; for, being in the forme of a ſervant, yet theſe ſervants, who knew him not, as would ſeem, obey all his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how uſeleſſe — like ſoever they ſeemed to be.</p>

What the Ruler ſaith, of giving of wine to men who have well drunk, is to be underſtood, not of exceſſe, but of drinking to ſatisfaction. However, it is but a ſimple narration without an approbation on Chriſt, or his pen-mans part. Nor did Chriſt, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſo much good wine to them, who had already drunk ſo much, give any evidence of his allowance of intemperance, for he had another end in it, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And beſides, all the creatures which men daily conſume by exceſſe, are his gift by common Providence, to which mens exceſſe and abuſe cannot be imputed. But it is a mans dutie, to look on Chriſts liberality as a trial to his ſobriety. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts works, when they are rightly conſidered, will be found worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and albeit the worker were not known, yet they will commend themſelves; for, the Ruler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the wine, when he <hi>knew not whence it was.</hi> 2.

Ignorance of Chriſts hand in a work, makes men to aſcribe it to others, and ſo take Chriſts glory from him; for, <hi>the Ruler called the Bridegroom,</hi> and aſcribed it to him. 4. In the compariſon which the Governour of the feaſt maketh betwixt other mens way, and the Bridegrooms, which was indeed Chriſts work, we have a fit reſemblance betwixt the faſhion of the world and Satan, and Chriſts way; They ſet out their beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities firſt, but worſe come after, but Chriſt in his dealing, may begin more harſhly, but he is ſtill the longer the better.</p>

Chriſt did begin to work miracles, not in his infancie, nor in the time of his private life, but when he entred to his Miniſtry, and to publiſh his doctrine which his miracles were to confirme; for, <hi>John</hi> ſaith not only, this was the firſt miracle he did in <hi>Cana,</hi> though that was true, but. <hi>This beginning of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did Jeſus,</hi> as being ſimply the firſt. 2. Chriſt doth not chooſe perſons or places for manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in or to them, as men or carnal reaſon would judge, nor will he ſtand to manifeſt his glory in an obſcure place, and by ſo doing, make it famous; therefore it is again marked, that he did this in <hi>Cana of Galilee,</hi> now made famous, of an obſcure village, by his working. 3. Chriſts glory is his ſupreme end in all his working, to which all other ends and effects muſt be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; for, he did this, <hi>and manifeſted forth his glory.</hi> 4. The end of Chriſts miracles was to ſet forth his own proper glory of his Godhead, as principal Agent of them, though his Manhood ſometime concurred as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48148:18"/>
a Miniſter in the work: for he manifeſted forth his glory, as doing this by his own power; whereas Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles were but inſtruments in what was done by them. 5. It is a part of Gods glory, that he only can work a true miracle, and neither Satan not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtrument by their own power; for, in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle he manifeſted his glory proper to him as God. 6. One work and miracle of Chriſt doth ſet forth his glory much, being well conſidered: for, by this one, <hi>he manifeſted forth his glory;</hi> for, in it ſhined the glory of his Omnipotencie, and of his Liberality; by it he declared that he is a Supplier of wants whetever he cometh; that he can bring excellent things out of that which is naughtie; that he can make things more comfortable then they are in their own nature; that it is he who turnes water into wine, and ſorrow into joy; that he made that change betwixt water and wine in a moment, which nature doth but in a year, by making water to fructifie the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt hath errands in eminent places, as well as obſcure, and will not deſpiſe eminent perſons or places for their eminencie, more then the baſe for their baſeneſſe; and he can make the work of his Kingdome in a land advance from obſcure beginnings and places, to be more eminent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; So much may we gather from Chriſts going out of obſcure <hi>Cana</hi> to <hi>Capernaum</hi> a chief City in <hi>Galilee.</hi> 3.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48148:19"/>
into the outer Court of the Temple, under a pretext of having them near at hand to the people, and that the cattel that were there, had been already overſeen by the Prieſts to be perfect: if not alſo, that they were more acceptable which were bought there. Theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions Chriſt reformeth, partly, by terrour and force; driving the men and their cattel out with a ſcourge made (belike) of the cords wherewith they led and tied the cattel, and overthrowing the Tables with the money; and partly, by his word, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome to take away their commodities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all to prophane the Temple with their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. What is here ſaid concerning the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is not to be applied to places ſet apart for publick worſhip under the Goſpel; (for, however it be a fault to apply ſuch places to common and prophane u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eſpecially to the impeding of publick worſhip, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the caſe of neceſſity, yet they are not typically holy as the Temple was) but to the Church of Chriſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1 The obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and ſuch like dayes is a Jewiſh rite, proper to them, and not belonging to the Chriſtian Church; for, <hi>John,</hi> who wrote laſt, knew it for no other then the <hi>Jewes Paſſeover,</hi> or, a feaſt of theirs. 2. Chriſt our Lord went up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> at the Paſſeover, in obedience to the Ceremonial Law, yet in force, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 23. and that he might take occaſion in the concourſe from all places in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like time, to publiſh his office and doctrine. By the firſt, to teach us condeſcendence and reverence to all the Ordinances of God, and by the ſecond, that we ſhould neglect no occaſion of promoving the honour of God in our ſtations. 3. Great abuſes may creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the viſible Church, and corruption may get far in; for, ſo was it here, <hi>He found in the Temple thoſe that ſold oxen and ſheep, &amp;c.</hi> This one was the fruit of many more. 4. The covetouſneſs of Church-men is the great breeder and entertainer of abuſes and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions in the Houſe of God, whatever be the pretences they are cloaked with; for, this was the riſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes here. 5. There is no hope of reforming abuſes in the Church, till Chriſt come and take order with them; and when ſuch as ſhould ſee to it, will not, Chriſt will finde a way for it, though he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of mens following any unlawful courſe, or to which they have not a calling to promove this; for, here Chriſt cometh to purge, and when the Civil Magiſtrate was Heathen, and cared not for Religion, and the ordinary Church rulers had an hand in the tranſgreſſion; yet Chriſt doth it by his abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as Lord of the houſe. 6. When other means faile, Chriſt can uſe violent remedies, and by plagues put ſinners from their courſes; Yea, when he cometh to reforme, he may ſee it juſt to ſmite the very creatures for ſinners cauſe. So are we here taught, in that by force, <hi>be drave them all out of the Temple, and the ſheep, and the oxen</hi> 7. Our Lords face is very terrible when he is angry, even in his abaſement; and a weak mean of Reformation in his hand, and aſſiſted with his power and terrour, will ſerve the turn; for, <hi>when he had made a ſcourge of ſmall cords</hi> (more fit in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for affrighting children, then for this work) <hi>he drave them all out,</hi> and none durſt reſiſt him. 8. It is the duty of all ſuch as are employed in a work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to teſtifie their zeal and integrity, by not minding or ſeeking their own things under pretext thereof; ſo much doth Chriſt: practice teach, who <hi>poured out the changers money, and overthrew the Tables,</hi> but put none of it up. 9. There ought to be no tryfling nor compoſition in the matter of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Houſe of God no leſſe muſt ſatisfie then putting them out at doors, as here Chriſt doth. 10. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, even after they have been caſt out by Chriſts own hand, may yet creep in again into the Houſe of God; in which caſe Chriſt will deal more ſeverely; for, Chriſt, having purged the Temple in this firſt year of his Miniſtry, hath it again to purge of the ſame evils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.12, 13. in the laſt yeare, where, in ſtead of <hi>an houſe of Merchandize,</hi> he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with making it <hi>a den of thieves.</hi> 11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation will not be through, when only force and violent remedies are applied to purge, unleſſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be joyned with it, to take out the roots of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions out of mens mindes, and to make them willing to concurre and reforme themſelves; for, Chriſt joyneth his Word here, bidding ſome <hi>take theſe things hence,</hi> and warning all not to abuſe his houſe. 12. As Chriſt is Lord and heire of his Fathers houſe, the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. and therefore careth for it; ſo all who have relation to God as their Father, their heart will riſe in his quarrel, when his honour, houſe or ſervice are wronged, nor can they endure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of what deſireth his houſe; <hi>Make not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my Fathers houſe an houſe of merchandize.</hi> 13. Albeit men would paſſe over faults done to Gods houſe, and beare with them, yet Chriſt will not, but in due time will ſee to the redreſſing of them; as here we ſee in this inſtance. 14. Things lawful, being done in a wrong time and place, become ſin, as it is alſo unlawful to ſpend what is dedicated to God, in common or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uſes; both which are reproved in this, <hi>Make not my fathers houſe,</hi> dedicated to him, <hi>an houſe of Merchandize,</hi> though Merchandize be lawful in its own time and place.</p>

Such as are faithful diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and conſcientious hearers, have the promiſe of a ſanctified memory, by the Spirits bringing Scriptures to their remembrance as they need; for, thus it was, that <hi>his diſciples remembred that it was written, &amp;c.</hi> Yet we ought in this to guard againſt neglect of ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Scripture, expecting ſomewhat to be ſuggeſted;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48148:19"/>
againſt leaning to the ſuggeſting of it, as the reaſon why we faſten faith on it, rather then if we found it by ſearch agreeing with our need, which were to make it no divine Scripture to us, but when it is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted; and againſt Satans deluſions who may ſuggeſt Scriptures, unto ſoules taken with this way, under falſe gloſſes. 4. Much is ſpoken of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament under types, and it ſhould be our care in reading it, to underſtand theſe types well, and ſee Chriſt the truth in them; for, ſo do the diſciples ſee a Prophecie of Chriſt held forth in the profeſſion and practice of <hi>David</hi> the type. 5. Zeale, providing it be according to knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable grace, when men are employed about right things, not negligently and for the faſhion, but affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately. As herein Chriſt hath given us a patterne, who excelled in all graces, and particularly, that of zeale. 6. As Gods houſe, and the matter of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Ordinances, are the chief object of zeale, which ſhould be ballanced with meekneſſe in our own matters; ſo true zeal is the only right and acceptable principle of Reformation; and men will go no further in the ſtudy of Reformation, then there is zeal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt what diſhonoureth God, and love to that which honoureth him; for, upon this principle did Chriſt reforme; and he was affected with the <hi>zeal of Gods houſe.</hi> 7. Albeit true zeal do truſt God with caring for his own affaires, and ſo is neither diffident nor haſtie, yet the nature of it is to be a ſpending grace, and it will affect the perſon with pain, till what is amiſſe in Gods houſe be rectified; And it will encline a man, having Gods call, to ſtoop to meaneſt employments, and to feare no hazards in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on Gods work; for, <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up,</hi> and Chriſt evidenced how much his zeal affected both body and minde, by abaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this mean emploiment of ſcourging out beaſts and men, and by expoſing himſelfe to their fury, if he had not been armed with divine terrour. 8. Albeit that zealous inſtruments were removed, and love and zeal among men ſhould decay, and they neglect and become careleſſe of the matters of God; yet Chriſt never wanteth zeal to reſent and redreſſe the wrongs done to Gods houſe; for of him it is ſtill true, <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up.</hi>

For, ſeeing theſe that were in power did tolerate theſe things they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was boldneſſe in him to undertake it, unleſſe he had an extraordinary calling, or were the Meſſiah, and if ſo he were, they deſire a proof of his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſome ſigne. Chriſt in anſwering, remits them (but in dark termes) to his death, which he foreſaw and would permit them to put him to, and to his Reſurrection, to prove that he was the true Meſſiah, and Saviour of ſinners. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Gods houſe, will never want oppoſition from corrupt men, even when Chriſt and his terrour is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently ſeen in it; for, Chriſt met with oppoſition thus far, that we ſhould not ſtumble when we meet with more. 2, Obſtinate wicked men, and eſpecially polluters of the Houſe of God, will hardly be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however they be convinced; for, theſe Jewes <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> again, or except againſt what he did, now when terrour had driven them out, and they had nothing to ſay. 3. Whatever pretences men may have, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they think to palliate their corruptions in Gods ſervice, and make them plauſible, yet when Chriſt cometh, he will make their greateſt Patrons ſpeechleſs in that cauſe; for, they are put to the door with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and when they would carp moſt, they dare ſay nothing in defence of the corruptions themſelves, only they queſtion his authority to purge them out 4. When mens hearts are once hardened in ill courſes; even a ſhake with the terrour of God will not gaine them, but ſo ſoon as the fit is over, they will not fear impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſpeak againſt Chriſt; for, ſo do they when he draweth back his terrour. 5. When enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation cannot juſtifie their own faults, they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarrel the calling of Reformers, then yield to the convincing truth held out by them; for, their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion importeth their queſtioning of his calling to do this, ſince he had given no ſigne for it. 6.

The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of ſuperſtitious and greedy enemies of Truth and Reformation, will be ſatisfied with no leſſe then the lives of Reformers; and as God permitted Chriſt to be killed, ſo he may permit the lives of notable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers to be taken by enemies, that ſo they may be made conforme to their head, and that their ſufferings

may be a ſeale and teſtimony to their doctrine; for, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple,</hi> doth import, that he knew no ſignes would ſatisfie them, but to have him killed, hereby alſo teaching all his followers, what to expect in doing the like work. 10. Chriſt foreknew that he would not ſuccumbe in his ſufferings, but would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and all the malice of his enemies, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them their will, and then riſing again the third day by his own power, as it accordingly came to paſſe: for, ſaith he, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up.</hi> 11.

A work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is a work of great difficulty, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with much oppoſition and many delays, before it be perfected; for, ſo much doth the Jewes exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption againſt Chriſts words, taken in their own ſenſe, import, <hi>Fourtie and ſix years was the Temple in building,</hi> reckoning all the time betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> edict, of their laying the foundation, and the ſixth yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> wherein it was finiſhed, after many delayes, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.15. Or, however their ſupputation hold, yet it was certainly long in building. 4. Men do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake Chriſt, (take his words as they will,) when they meaſure his power by their carnal reaſon: for, take them even in their own ſenſe, it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to <hi>reare up the Temple in three dayes,</hi> ſince he was God, and did undertake a greater work, even to raiſe up his own body from the dead. 5.

                  <p>Laſtly, in this part of the chapter, <hi>John</hi> recordeth ſome further of Chriſts proceedings at this feaſt; that he wrought ſuch miracles, as drew divers to profeſſe faith in him, whoſe profeſſion he would not truſt, as knowing well what they were, as he doth all men, even what is moſt inward and ſecret in them, and that of himſelfe, without any information from others. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt will not ſatisfie the curioſity or tempting humours of men; yet he will not denie to work whatſoever may be needful for the confirmation of the faith of his own: for, though he would grant no preſent ſigne to the contentious Jewes, <hi>v.</hi> 18. yet he <hi>did miracles in Jeruſalem at the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in the feaſt day,</hi> though it be not recorded in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular what they were; hereby alſo giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that when Chriſt cometh to work a work of Reformation, (as here) he may ſometime ſecond it, (not with miracles now, but) with notable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of Providence, to gain credit to his work, and faithful inſtruments about it, and, it may be, to quaſh the fury of malicious oppoſites. 2. It is not unuſual for ſome natural men to be ſo far affected with Chriſt and his working, as to be convinced in their judgement of ſome excellency in him, and be drawn to profeſſe ſome ſort of embracing of him; and yet they remain ſtill in nature, and unconverted; for, <hi>many believed in his Name,</hi> or profeſſed to do ſo, who yet were unſound, as the ſequel cleareth. 3. It is a clear evidence of unſoundneſſe, when Chriſts works are the chief thing, drawing men to profeſſe faith, and not his Word, revealing his nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: for, ſuch was their faith, <hi>They believed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw the miracles which he did.</hi> Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are not affected with their own miſery and Chriſts mercy, and ſo have not a right principle; and Chriſts works will not be alwayes alike glorious, and ſo their affection bottomed on that, will ebbe and flow, and at laſt evaniſh. 4. As Chriſt no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to reforme, but Satan in enemies will be raiſing ſtormes, and laying ſnares for him, in which unſound converts will not prove truſty, nor back him, but be ready to turne enemies; ſo it is wiſdome in trying times to be wary whom we truſt, even of Profeſſors: for, <hi>Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them,</hi> that is, ſeeing hazard appearing, he would not familiarly converſe with them, as men to be confided in: for, he kept but one <hi>Judas</hi> of ſuch, and he betrayed him. 5. Albeit we cannot infallibly diſcern of Profeſſors, before they diſcover themſelves, yet Chriſt knoweth hypocrites before they diſcover themſelves to men; for, <hi>he knew all men,</hi> and them among the reſt, ſo as not to truſt them. 6 Chriſts diſcovering of one or more hypocrites, is a document to all to take heed to themſelves, as being ſeen and known of him: therefore is his knowing them expreſſed in a general, <hi>He knew all men,</hi> 7. Chriſts knowledge of men is not conjectural, or by report, but certain, as being by and from himſelf as God: for, <hi>he needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man.</hi> 8. Chriſt doth infallibly know what is in-moſt, or moſt ſecret and hidden in man, the thought whereof ſhould excite all to ſelf examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be an encouragement to the ſincere; ſo much is imported in this reaſon, <hi>For he knew what was in man.</hi>

                  <p>The occaſion of this Conference and Sermon of Chriſt, is, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (a Phariſee, and not one of the common ſort, but a Ruler and Member of the Councel) his coming to Chriſt by night, and in his diſcourſe giving him reverent titles, and teſtifying that he and the reſt of the Phariſees were convinced by Chriſts miracles, that he was a teacher ſent of God, however their malice drave them over the belly of their light. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1 So great is the excellencie of Chriſt, and the riches and efficacy of his grace, as he can not only convince, but will even, (when he pleaſeth) convert and draw in greateſt enemies to him: for, <hi>Nicodemus a Phariſee and ruler of the Jewes came to Chriſt,</hi> and albeit the beginnings were but ſmall, yet they came to further maturity afterward. 2. Even Perſecutors and haters of Chriſt may be ſo for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48148:21"/>
convinced of his excellencie in his Miniſtry, as in cold blood they will be forced to ſee God ſhining in it; for, ſaith <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in name of his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, the Phariſees and Rulers, <hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God:</hi> and the like thoughts may men be forced to have of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſence in and with good Miniſters, who yet have not found enough evidences of grace for all that. 3. There may be alike conviction and light in mens minde, which yet doth not work alike on their will and affections; but many who know as much as others, being left to the natural corruption of their hearts, do yet ſit ſtill, when theſe others by the power of grace are drawn to Chriſt; for, ſaith <hi>Nicodemus, we know, &amp;c.</hi> and yet onely he came to Jeſus. 4. Great places, and honour, and credit prove oft-times great ſnares to men, to hold them from Chriſt, or from ſuch an open avowing of him as becometh; for, <hi>Nicodemus came to Jeſus by night,</hi> as fearing to loſe his place and reputation with the reſt, or to ſuſtaine ſome damage, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to be found ignorant, and one that needed come to be taught. So great cauſe have men to be content with their mean eſtate which hideth them from many ſnares, and to pity and have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to others who have greater tentations. 5. Men may ſeeme to have very high thoughts of Chriſt, who yet come farre ſhort of that eſtimation that is due to him; for, all he ſaith is, <hi>Rabbi, thou art a Teacher come from God,</hi> or, an extraordinary Teacher, whereas he was God over all. 6. Chriſts miracles were known, even to enemies, to be done by no jugglery, and to be ſuch as could be wrought onely by divine power, and to be a proof of his authority; for, it was acknowledged, <hi>no man can do theſe miracles that thou doeſt</hi> (of which ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 2.23.) <hi>except God be with him.</hi>

Secondly, <hi>meeting with an ignorant ſcholar, he repeats and explaines the way of this birth,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Thirdly, Nicodemus <hi>continuing yet ignorant, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked for the ſame, and for the unbelief common to him with the reſt of the Phariſees,</hi> ver. 9, 10, 11, 12. Fourthly, <hi>he leads</hi> Nicodemus <hi>up to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, as the onely revealer of ſpiritual myſteries, and author of ſalvation through faith in him,</hi> ver. 13, 14, 15. Fifthly, <hi>this way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the certainty thereof, is confirmed and commended from the love of God in ſending Chriſt for that end,</hi> ver. 16.17. <hi>Unto which is ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the condemnation of ſuch as ſhall, by unbeliefe and delight in their ſinful wayes, reject this remedy,</hi> ver. 18, 19. <hi>Proving that it is their evil deeds which makes them ſo to do.</hi> ver. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe Chriſt begins with this Phariſee at the firſt principles of Religion, and by a grave aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration teacheth the neceſſity that all men have of a change by regeneration, if they would expect to enjoy a part either in the Kingdome of grace or glory, for ſo this <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> may be extended to ſignifie. It is ſaid Chriſt <hi>anſwered,</hi> and ſaid this to him, either becauſe <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had moved a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning this matter unto him whom he had called a Teacher, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. though it be not record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or becauſe Chriſt ſaw his need, and <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to it, by applying fit remedies, and ſeeking to cure all his ills at the root. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt is very meek to ſuch as come to him, though with many weakneſſes, and will not ſaile to take pains upon them to bring them further up; for, though <hi>Nicodemus</hi> failed in acknowledging him onely for a Teacher, and ſtealing to him by night; yet Chriſt paſſeth over all this, and conſidering his need, doth teach him. 2. The great buſineſſe of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially profeſſing themſelves ſcholars at Chriſts ſchool, ſhould be to know the way of ſalvation, and how to be in a ſtate of grace, and in the way to glory; for, ſo much doth Chriſts grave and doubled aſſeveration in preſſing this point, as moſt neceſſary, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the want of a part in this Kingdome as a certification ſad enough, whatever a man have elſe, teach us. 3. Every man by nature (be he in appearance better or worſe) is out of the ſtate of grace, and unmeet for glory, till a change be wrought. So much doth Chriſt gravely aſſert, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man</hi> (be who he will, an Epicure, or Civilian, or painted Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, a groſſe ſinner, or under the power of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and heart corruption onely) <hi>be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he cannot ſee,</hi> (or enjoy, or partake of, or, as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>enter into) the Kingdome of God.</hi> And by this doctrine, Chriſt puts this Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee from all conceit of himſelf, by diſcovering his danger of periſhing, that ſo he may become teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 4. For working of this change in man, mans nature is not in ſuch a condition as needs ſome reparation onely, but is wholly corrupt; Not will a bare acknowlegment of Chriſt, nor a moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of carriage and principles, nor common gifts and graces ſerve a mans turn, unleſſe there be a change of the whole man from the ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to the ſtate of holineſſe, and a reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and renovation, in ſome meaſure, of that image of God wherein he was created; for, a man muſt be <hi>born again,</hi> or, <hi>the ſecond time,</hi> (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) before he be right. The word rendred <hi>again,</hi> ſignifieth alſo to be born all of new; as a man going to build his houſe better, razeth it to the very bottome to lay a new foundation, and as a man beginning to declare a matter from the very original and firſt riſe of it, and ſo <hi>Luke</hi> uſeth the word, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.3. 5. This change and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is called a <hi>birth,</hi> with alluſion to a mans being born of his mother, becauſe of many reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances betwixt the one and the other. As, 1. As a child is not born without ſome pain, ſo every true convert finds ſome pain, in leſſe or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in working this change; and they who find
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48148:21"/>
leaſt at firſt, may meet with more afterward. 2. As in a birth, a new creature is brought forth; So in regeneration there is (not a new ſubſtance of ſoul and body, but) a new nature communicate, in the renovation of the faculties of the ſoul and of our nature, and not a parching up of the old. 3. As in a birth, there is a perfect creature brought forth in reſpect of parts; ſo regeneration goeth through the whole man, and worketh a change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. 4. As it is not a birth, when there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much pain, and yet there is nothing brought forth; ſo convictions, terrors, challenges of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a ſpirit of bondage, will not prove a man regenerate, unleſſe theſe beginnings contribute to, and be followed with the bringing forth of this new creature, 5. As in a birth, the creature is brought forth, living, endued with properties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and diſpoſitions agreeable to the nature that began it; ſo by regeneration there cometh a principle of new life, whence flow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> actions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, comforts and contentments in ſome meaſure of reſemblance and conformity with God. 6. As a babe new born is ſenſible of what is contrary to that life it hath, and is deſirous of the means that may preſerve that life. So every regenerate perſon will feele hurt from what is contrary unto grace, and will long after the means appointed for feeding of it. 7. As every born child hath an inclination to love thoſe who are begotten of the ſame parents, and hath a natural inclination to multiply its kind; So regeneration leads men to love all thoſe who bear the image of God, and to deſire an enlargement and encreaſe of Chriſts family. 8. As upon the birth there ariſeth a viſible relation betwixt the child born and its parents; So in regeneration, beſide the change of diſpoſition, wherein progreſſe is made by ſanctification, there is a relative change of a mans ſtate and perſon being ingroſſed in Chriſt the ſtock, by Chriſts application of himſelf unto him, and his apprehending of Chriſt by faith; whereby he becometh a Son of God through Chriſt <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. This change by regeneration as it is of the whole man, to it cannot be rought by any power in man, but muſt come from above: At firſt man is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and Chriſt muſt apply himſelf to him, before he can do any thing, and what he doth afterward for carrying on this work, he muſt do it by ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A regenerate man is not onely enabled to ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cern the things of God, but is tranſlated into the ſtate of grace, and made ſure of glory, the ſtate of grace being the porch of heaven, and grace, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the bud; for, from Chriſts aſſertion we may clearly gather, that <hi>a man who is born again, ſhall ſee the kingdome of God.</hi> 8. Such as are regenerate and brought into the ſtate of grace, come under a peculiar dominion of God, being not onely under the external Ordinances and government of his Kingdome, but having a throne erected to God in their hearts, righteouſneſſe and grace reigning over the Law and the curſe, the love of Chriſt ſet up as a Commander in them, and they abiding under the ſhadow of his wings and protection; and at the end of their courſe, they enter into glory, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity whereof can be no better expreſſed to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, then under the ſimilitude of a Kingdom, which is the greateſt outward glory and happineſſe imaginable here; for theſe cauſes is the felicity of a regenerate man held forth under the name of enjoying a part in <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely the ſtate of glory is to be underſtood, as <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. and frequently, but the external adminiſtration of the Goſpel, as is frequent in the Goſpels, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. and the ſtate of men regenerate by the Goſpel, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. and elſewhere.</p>

Shewing that this birth was not natural, but ſpiritual, wrought by the Spirit whoſe working is like unto water cleanſing filth. To underſtand this <hi>water</hi> of Baptiſme will not agree with this place; for, this water doth certainly regenerate, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is baptized is not certainly regenerate, as witneſſe <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8.13.23. and others. Further, this water is preſſed as abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation; whereas men may go to heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptiſme, if it be not contemned; as of old the elect ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> who died in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without circumciſion, were ſaved, ſo the thief on the Croſſe was ſaved without baptiſme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>the holy Ghoſt and fire</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one thing, or the Spirit working like fire in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging droſſe, ſo <hi>the water and Spirit</hi> ſignifieth the Spirit working like water. Hence it is that verſe 6. he repeats onely the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as including all that is here ſignified by <hi>the water and Spirit.</hi> And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the Spirits working, under the name of water, is no unuſual expreſſion in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa</hi> 44.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. No apprehenſion of impoſſibility in the matter of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, doth warrant men to ſhift the thoughts of the neceſſity of it, or to think that any leſſe then regeneration will availe them to ſalvation; for, Chriſt notwithſtanding <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his doubt; preſſeth it as neceſſary, and gravely interpoſeth his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (whom <hi>Nicodemus</hi> acknowledged for a Teacher come from God) to perſwade him of it, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne of water, he cannot into the kingdome of God.</hi> 2. As Chriſt is meek and tender unto ſuch as bring their doubts and ignorance unto him (and therefore informeth <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) ſo, mens queſtioning of truth, and their propounding of doubts againſt it, is an occaſion that Chriſt makes uſe of for clearing of truth yet more; for, he taketh occaſion of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his doubt, to clear the doctrine of regeneration. 3. Regeneration is wrought neither by the power of nature, nor by outward Ordinances onely and alone, but by the efficacy of the holy Spirit, who doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſinner, and bleſſe outward means to him, before he can be changed; for, <hi>a man is borne of the Spirit.</hi> 4. The Spirit in working this change of regeneration, worketh like water; for, as water cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is filthy, and makes it bright, ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth apply the blood of Chriſt, for cleanſing polluted nature, and renewing of it in true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as water cooleth and refreſheth the thirſty and faint-hearted, ſo the benefits purchaſed by Chriſt being applyed by the Spirit, do refreſh the fainting ſouls of ſinners in the perplexities and pangs of the new birth, or afterward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. And, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fructifieth the barren ground, ſo the Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the regenerate man fruitful in every good word and work; Therefore is this birth deſcribed to be a mans being <hi>born of water and of the Spirit.</hi>

The corruption of mens nature, being well ſeene, would ſoone diſcover the neceſſity of a change by regeneration, and none will ſleight this, but they who are ignorant of the former; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt upon this ground preſſe the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a new birth. 2. Men by nature, or by their natural birth, are altogether corrupt and fleſhly creatures, in all the powers and faculties of ſoule and body; for, <hi>he that is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> or, one lump of corruption, <hi>fleſh</hi> being taken here for corrupt nature, and ſo including not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and fleſhly ſinnes onely, but even the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde alſo, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. 3. The corruption of mens nature is tranſmitted by generation and propagation from their parents, and, ſo is the ſeed of actual tranſgreſſions before they break forth; and (however children of Church-members be borne federally holy, and in viſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. yet) every one who cometh of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ordinary way of generation, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it; for, <hi>that which is borne of the fleſh,</hi> or, of corrupt man, <hi>is fleſh.</hi> 4.

The corruption by our natural birth, and our unfitneſſe for heaven thereby, is, to the Lords own, cured and made up by the Spirit of regeneration; for, therefore is it ſubjoyned, <hi>that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> 6. A true evidence of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of mens being fitted for heaven by it, is when men become ſpiritual in diſpoſition, ſenſes and diſcerning, motions and inclinations, and in actions, leaving a ſtamp of their diſpoſitions even upon their common actions; and when they labour not onely to have habits of grace, but to have the ſpirit of theſe graces; or, the daily influences of the Spirit, to make them lively, freſh and active; for, <hi>that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> not by a change of ſubſtance, but as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>

it is nothing the leſſe true that he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the way of it; for, as the winde blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth freely, and at the command of no creature, and as the ſound and effects thereof prove that it is, and yet mens reaſon cannot reach to know from whence it ariſeth, and whether it goeth, or from how far it cometh, and how far it goeth, ſeeing at the ſame time there are contrary winds in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the earth; ſo in this ſpiritual birth and change, wherein the Spirit worketh freely and efficaciouſly, it may be ſenſibly found by effects, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the manner and way how it is wrought, be incomprehenſible. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Albeit Gods works, and particularly in regeneration, be glorious and excellent, at which faith may far more wonder then at a mans conception in the womb, <hi>Pſal</hi> 139.14. Yet Chriſt condemneth that wondring as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which ſloweth from unbelief, and from mens counting that impoſſible which they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; Therefore Chriſt forbids ſuch wondring, <hi>marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> when yet he holds out the thing as incomprehenſible. So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is the nature of faith, that it maketh that to be a commendable duty, which were ſinful, if coming from unbelief. 2. Albeit all men, even the greateſt Doctors, lie under a neceſſity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate if they would be ſaved; Yet Chriſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded from that number, being ſanctified in his conception by the holy Ghoſt, and borne without ſin; Therefore he ſecludeth himſelf here, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and all others, when he ſaith, <hi>ye muſt be borne again.</hi> 3.

Good uſe may be made of common and obvious things, to further ſpiritual mindedneſſe, and to help to ſatisfie us and quiet our reaſonings in ſpiritual things; for, Chriſt by this ſimilitude caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a copie to all, to be led by thoughts of the winde, to think on regeneration, and ſilenceth his wondring, by making his common ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about the winde, ſubſervient to quiet his faith about this myſtery; and by the condſietation of ſuch things as theſe, God bringeth <hi>Job</hi> to duſt and aſhes before him. 5.

As the winde bloweth through the world freely, not ſtaying for the command, nor caring for the prohibition of any creature; ſo the Spirit in his working is a free agent, working where, on whom, when, and in what meaſure he pleaſeth, and will be hindered by none, <hi>the winde bloweth where it liſteth.</hi> 2. As there is ſomewhat in the winde which is ſenſible, and felt or heard, proving that it is, <hi>thou heareſt the ſound thereof;</hi> ſo is the working of the Spirit diſcernable in the effects, by them that have it, Onely as the winde is not alwayes alike loud, nor ſenſible, ſo the working of the Spirit is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, nor in all alike diſcernable; and as they who hear the winde, muſt have the ſenſe of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear; ſo men who deſire to feele the effects of the Spirit, would not over-cloud their own diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with jealouſies and miſrepreſentations; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it would be conſidered, that the Spirit is one gift, and diſcerning of him and his working is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother gift, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.) to be ſought of him, or elſe we may miſtake; Likewiſe, this diſcerning faculty may ſometime be keept up where the true work it, either for trial, that we may not build our ſelves on what is within us, but on Chriſt; or for chaſtiſement, becauſe we have grieved the Spirit. There may alſo be ſome babes in Chriſt, who cannot for a time diſcern their own members, though they really have them. 3. As there is ſome what in the winde incomprehenſible to natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>thou canſt not tell, whence it cometh, &amp;c.</hi> So in the Spirits working, there is ſomewhat not onely beyond the reach of natural reaſon, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.14 but even above ſanctified reaſon, as to know how he inſinuates himſelf with the Word upon us, and frameth that hidden man of grace; There are myſteries here to be adored, and calling for praiſe, that he ſhould work ſo admirably in us, rather then to be pried into: In all theſe reſpects, is this compariſon of the winde applied, <hi>So is every one that is borne of the Spirit.</hi>

The great cauſe of mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of divine things, is, their carnal reaſon, which (eſpecially in able men) keeps them from ſimple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and reſting on what is revealed, till they ſee a reaſon for every thing: for, this is <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his conſtant objection, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> 3.

                  <p>In the next place, Chriſt reproveth his unbelief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his ignorance, which was common to him with the reſt of the Jewes, eſpecially the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees; this he doth upon two grounds, whereof the firſt (in this verſe) is taken from the aſſurance he had of the certainty of his doctrine, it being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known as by eye-ſight. This way of certainty by <hi>ſeeing,</hi> is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 32. as proper to him who was in the boſome of the Father; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it thus ſtrictly, while Chriſt ſaith, <hi>we have ſeen,</hi> it may be underſtood of the whole Trinity, bearing witneſſe with him, <hi>John</hi> 8.16, 29. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5 7. But taking this <hi>ſeeing</hi> more largely, the expreſſion ſeemeth rather to take in <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was the preſent publick witneſſe with Chriſt at that time, and who (as others, Prophets and Apoſtles) had the certainty of what he preached in his own meaſure, from Chriſts illumination, and did indeed preach what was moſt certain, and what Chriſt revealed out of the boſome of the Father; though few did believe and embrace either Chriſts teſtimony or his. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Where Chriſt hath men to reprove for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, there will be alſo unbelief found that is blame-worthy; for not only cannot ignorant men believe, but in many things men are bound to embrace truth by faith, though they cannot comprehend them by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, and ſo unbelief is the cauſe of not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with theſe high myſteries; therefore doth Chriſt challenge <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for <hi>not receiving the witneſſe;</hi> or not embracing this truth by faith, reſting on the Authority of God the Revealer. 2. Ill Scholars that come to Chriſt may be led back to ſee more of their miſery, common to them with others, that ſo they may not reſt on any thing they think peculiar in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but be ſtirred up effectually to ſtudie to profit; therefore doth Chriſt ſhew <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that he was lying yet in the common ſin of others; <hi>Ye receive not, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Whatever miſtakes men have about ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual truthes, yet they are infallibly certain in them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, and infallibly known to Chriſt, who revealed them out of the boſome of the Father, as the ſure ground of our faith, and that he cannot miſlead ſuch as he teacheth; therefore doth Chriſt ſo gravely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and inculcate this principle, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen.</hi> The latter word explains the former, that he is as certain of it as of a thing ſeen, though not with bodily eyes. 4. Such is Chriſts condeſcendence, as to take in ſinful men with him in the ſame yoke of bearing witneſſe to the truth, and of partaking in their meaſure in the ſame honour with him the chief Shepherd, and of holding out the ſame infallible truth with him from the Word, though their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and certainty of it be from his gift, and inferiour to his; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>we ſpeak &amp;c. John</hi> being a conjunct witneſſe, ſpeaking the ſame ſure truth, and knowing it certainly in his meaſure, though Chriſt knew it in an higher way, both as God of himſelf, and as man by vertue of the perſonal union. 5. As it is no ſtrange thing to ſee men, (however they may hear, yet) not liking, embracing nor believing moſt certain and ſaving truths; even when ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf; ſo the certainty of divine doctrine will agg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond ground upon which Chriſt reproveth and aggreageth his unbelief, is, the plainneſſe of his doctrine: Chriſt had ſpoken of heavenly things in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48148:23"/>
plain way under a ſimilitude taken from earthly things, as, <hi>v</hi> 8. and if he did not comprehend and believe them ſo, what would he do if they had been ſpoken of as heavenly things in a ſtile ſuitable to their own nature? <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the will of Chriſt, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſouls do not affect high and lofty ſtiles, and quaintneſs of expreſſion, but that in doctrine they deſcend as low as may be, and accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the capacity of people; for, herein Chriſt commends his own love in drawing the copie; <hi>I have told you earthly things,</hi> 2. Even ſpiritual things, when they are ſpoken of under earthly ſimilitudes, are but earthly things in compariſon of what they would be, being ſpoken of in their own language and termes; therefore he calleth them, being ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>earthly things,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>heavenly things,</hi> expreſſed in a ſuitable ſtile. There is an eminencie in theſe things above what any ſimilitude can expreſſe, and when we come to know as we are known, we will finde it ſo. 3. When all is done that can be to bring down ſpiritual things to a peoples capacity, yet there is no power in men of themſelves to underſtand or cloſe with them; for, Chriſt found it ſo, I <hi>have told you earthly things, and ye believe not:</hi> and Miniſters need not think it ſtrange, if their doctrine be no better entertained then Chriſts was. 4. The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of doctrine doth aggreage the ſin of ignorance and unbelief, and make it more inexcuſable: for, it is a challenge, <hi>I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Such as are rightly convinced of their dulneſs in taking up ſpiritual things, when plainly expreſſed, will much more ſee their inability to take up theſe things in their own nature; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this will ſtand as a witneſſe how far men are from knowledge, or cloſing with ſpiritual things: for, ſo doth Chriſt hold out, <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things.</hi>

But the dependance on the former purpoſe, and the expreſſion of this in the by-paſt time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt was not yet aſcended in his humane nature, leads us rather to underſtand this aſcending to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, figuratively, of comprehending heavenly myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and entering on Gods Councel concerning the way of ſalvation, as it ſeemeth to be underſtood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 8. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 14. And ſo the meaning is, that no man of himſelfe can know or take up theſe things, that being Chriſts prerogative, who manifeſted himſelfe from the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in our nature, and yet as God, is ſtill in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and thus Chriſt having reproved <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for his ignorance, doth yet ſhew the remedy thereof in himſelfe. <hi>Whence Learn.</hi> 1. Chriſts ſharp Word is not his laſt Word to his own, but when he hath chalenged moſt ſharply for any fault, he is willing to offer himſelf, the onely remedy, to cure it; For, ſo doth he deale with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ignorance. 2. It is alike impoſſible for men, by their own parts and natural endowments, to take up and comprehend ſpiritual myſteries, as to climb up to heaven and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Gods Councel; Therefore is it called an <hi>aſcending up to heaven.</hi> 3. In ſo far as ſinners come to a true and ſaving knowledge of heavenly myſteries: they are in a ſort tranſported up to heaven from off the earth, as knowing the counſels of God, and being raviſhed with what they know; therefore alſo is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>aſcending to heaven.</hi> If <hi>Capernaum</hi> were exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23. becauſe of the offer of theſe things, what are they, who in ſome meaſure comprehend and embrace them? 4. It is proper to Chriſt the Mediatour only, in ſome ſenſe, to aſcend to heaven, and comprehend ſpiritual myſteries, both for the meaſure and degree of knowledge in theſe things, which, as God, is infinite, and as man, is large, as the humane nature is capable of, and for the kinde and manner of knowledge, which, as God, is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and, as man, by vertue of the perſonal union, whereas all others have any knowledge they have it from him; for, <hi>no man hath aſcended up to heaven,</hi> (or comprehended theſe things fully or of themſelves) <hi>but he that came down from heaven.</hi> 5. The Son of God in the boſome of the Father, was pleaſed to condeſcend ſo far, as to manifeſt himſelf unto the world in our nature, that ſo he might in our nature underſtand hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly myſteries, and communicate the knowledge thereof to his people; therefore it is marked as the ground of his <hi>aſcending to heaven,</hi> or comprehending of theſe things for his peoples uſe, that he <hi>came down from heaven, the Son of man,</hi> hereby ſhewing, that his abaſing of himſelf did exalt him as Mediatour God-man to that dignity, to be the ſtore-houſe of wiſdome and knowledge to his people; and that his love in ſtooping ſo low, to bring and communicate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to us, is remarkable; In all which, we are not to underſtand, that Chriſt, as God, did change place by his Incarnation, but only did ſtoop and demit himſelf to aſſume the humane nature in a perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 6. Chriſt by his Incarnation, and becoming man, did not ceaſe to be God, but continueth ſtill the ſame, filling heaven and earth; for, <hi>he that deſcended down from heaven, is in heaven,</hi> and ſo is upon the counſel of God ſtill, to teach us infalliblie. 7. The Son of God hath aſſumed the humane nature into ſo ſtrict a perſonal union, that what is proper to either nature, is aſcribed unto the perſon under whatſoever name; for, ſaith he, <hi>the Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> which is not to be underſtood, as if either his humane nature came from heaven, (for he is ſpeaking of what ſtill is there) or that his humane nature were in every place, but that the ſame perſon who is the Son of man according to our nature, is in heaven according to his divine nature, and yet but one perſon ſtill.

Chriſt by ſubjoyning this to the doctrine of regeneration, doth partly teach <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the way of a taining regeneration, which is by the Spirits applying of the merit and vertue of Chriſts death in the firſt act thereof, and by the regenerate mans applying the ſame by faith, for carrying on that work to cure themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; and partly, he teacheth him that regeneate men are not to reſt on any thing in them, but muſt be led out of themſelves to Chriſt for attaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1: Truly regenerate men, and ſuch as are minding that work in earneſt, will ſee great cauſe and need to make much uſe of Chriſt; for, ſo much doth this doctrine, and the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof teach. 2. Chriſt and the uſe to be made of him was pointed out to beleevers under the Old Teſtament by types and figures; which as it ſhould ſweeten unto us the reading of theſe things, ſo it ſhould point out our mercie, that we have not ſuch dark and long proſpects through which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they could look to him, but we may ſee him more clearly; for, Chriſt ſheweth here, that he was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the lifted up Serpent. 3. It is our duty to dip in the application of this and the like types, till we finde the agreement that is betwixt the truth and the type; for, ſo doth Chriſt caſt us a copy in the explication of this type, wherein we may ſee, firſt, They agree in the original occaſion: As Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels deadly miſery occaſioned the ſetting up of the Serpent, ſo the occaſion of Chriſts ſending into the world was mans ſinne and miſery, man being ſo bitten with that old Serpent, that the venome is gone through him all, and he become liable to intolerable pain, if his conſcience were not lulled aſleep. Secondly, they agree in the impulſive cauſe; That, as the Serpent was a remedy of Gods own preſcribing out of his great mercie, ſo is this remedy for loſt ſinners. Thirdly, they agree in their preſent condition when they were mad uſe of; for, as the Serpent was like that which bit them, ſo was Chriſt true man the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> anſwering to him by whom ſinne came into the world: as this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was without venome, ſo was he without ſin: as the Serpent was made of braſſe, and not of gold; ſo appeared he not in glorious ſtate, nor majeſty: and, as the Serpent was a very unlikely mean in it ſelf, ſo they needed clear eyes who would ſee ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on coming by a ſuffering Lord, by a worme and not a man. Fourthly, they agree in the uſe to be made of them, and in the fruits that follow thereupon. And ſo 1. As the Serpent was <hi>lifted up</hi> on a pole at Gods command, that the offer of this remedy might be made conſpicuous unto all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo Chriſt, in regard of Gods decree and ſentence againſt ſin, and in regard of predictions concerning him, <hi>muſt be lifted up</hi> on the croſſe, and be broken there, that this ointment might be let out for our cure, and he is made conſpicuous to the Church on the pole of the Goſpel, that faith may get footing on the offer made of him. 2. As the way of cure by the Serpent was a look, ſo it is <hi>beleeving in him,</hi> and laying hold on him by faith, that onely bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cure of the guilt of ſin, of the pain of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through ſin, and of the dominion of ſin. 3. As it was ground enough for any bitten Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite to look to this Serpent, that he had need, and thirſted for cure by this appointed mean; ſo a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As this look healed the bitten Iſraelite, and kept him from death, ſo though all men are in a ſtate of periſhing, and ſecluded from heaven without Chriſt, yet by faith in him ſinners are freed from death, and made heirs of life, <hi>they ſhall not periſh but have eternal life,</hi> and this includeth remiſſion, reconciliation, perſeverance, and all the means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe ends, and is a benefit far beyond what an Iſraelite got by looking to the Serpent.</p>

And here the benefit of giving him unto the world is commended from the free love of God contriving ſuch a way of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of loſt ſinners, and the certainty of ſinners ſalvation through faith in him, is confirmed from this, that it is Gods very end in ſending him, that beleevers ſhould not periſh. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The world of it ſelf is liable to pardition, and under ſinfulneſſe and miſery, from which there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, but by Chriſt the Sonne of God onely; for ſo it is here implyed. 2. This way of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is not to be aſcribed to any thing in man procuring the ſame, for God might juſtly have damned all, but to the free love of God onely; for,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48148:24"/>
ſo are we here taught. 3 Love to loſt man is not to be looked upon as ſhining in Chriſt onely, who willingly gave himſelf to redeeme him, but in the Father alſo, who loving loſt man, ſent his Sonne to ſuffer and do the office of a Mediator, that through his mediation he might (not begin to love them, but) communicate the effects of his love in a way agreeable to his juſtice; for, <hi>God loved the word,</hi> and that antecedently to his giving Chriſt, and as a cauſe of it. 4. This love, being rightly ſtudied, will be found matchleſſe and inexpreſſible, and ſo will all think of it, who are ſenſible of an intereſt in it, and of the fruits of it, <hi>God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world.</hi> See 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. 5. The match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe of this love may appear if we conſider, 1. The perſon who loveth, even God who was provoked by man, and who ſtandeth in no need of man, or of any thing to adde to his infinite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: <hi>God loved.</hi> 2. The object loved, which is <hi>the world,</hi> whereby we are not to underſtand all and every man (for that were to make God be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of his will; and of what he intends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man out of his love, ſeeing all get not good of Chriſt, and to have him giving Chriſt for them, for whom he will not ſanctifie himſelf, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, <hi>John</hi> 17.9.19.) but onely his owne in the world among loſt mankinde, who are not onely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from among all Nations and conditions of men in the world, and not of the Jewes onely, (as <hi>the world</hi> is taken, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. See <hi>John</hi> 11.51, 52. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.29) and who (as there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity or world of the reprobates as diſtinguiſhed from the elect, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. ſo they) make up a world or community of themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>John</hi> 6.33. But they are by nature the ſame that others of the world are, of the ſame race of curſed mankinde, and not onely living in the world, but after the faſhions of the world: And herein ſhineth the matchleſſe love of God, that he would not ſo far abandon loſt mankinde, but he would have a new and holy community to himſelf from among them, and would love theſe who had nothing love-worthy in themſelves more then they who were left in their miſerable eſtate. 3. This matchleſſe love appeareth in the effects, or gift beſtowed by it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Fathers onely Son by eternal generation and communication of the ſame eſſence, to be a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and Mediator for ſinners; <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Sonne.</hi> This gift and an intereſt in it, ſpeaketh more love then any other benefit a man can receive, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. and aſſureth of all other things in ſo farre as they tend to the mans good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 6. The way whereby benefit is reaped and gotten from this gifted Saviour, is onely by faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man, being put out of himſelf, and ſeeing himſelf in the ſame condition with the loſt world, doth flee to Chriſt the onely remedy, and roll him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon him as a ſufficient Saviour; for, it is <hi>he that beleeveth in him,</hi> that <hi>ſhall not periſh;</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a ſelf-condemned ſinner have not a particular aſſurance of an intereſt in Chriſt, yet he beleeveth when he caſteth himſelf upon him on all hazards: And albeit he miſſe many other qualifications, yet he is not to ſtand back, but to come to Chriſt, to get what he wanteth. 7. Albeit Chriſt be given onely to the elect, yet unto the viſible Church the offer is held out generally upon condition of faith, whereby reprobates are left inexcuſable, through their voluntary rejecting this mercie, and the elect, through Gods bleſſing on theſe offers and exhortations, are brought in in a way agreeable to their nature, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such as come to Chriſt, the Lord maketh no exception of what they have been, nor of the degrees of their faith, if it be true; for, <hi>whoſoever beleeveth ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> 9.

                  <p>To confirme the certainty of beleevers ſalvation, Chriſt inſiſteth yet upon the end of Gods ſending him in the fleſh, which was not to condemne the world, but for the ſalvation of the world through him.

For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt in his firſt coming, came not to judge and ſentence any, but to hold out the way of life as a meek Saviour and Mediator, as <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55, 56. <hi>John</hi> 12.47. but nothing he did then was to procure condemnation to any, but on the contrary to make offer of ſalvation to loſt man, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, by reaſon of mans corruption, and not making uſe of him, his coming did heighten mens condemnation, as <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1.

wherein Chriſt would have us well verſed and rooted, to know the ſure and happy condition of theſe who beleeve in him; that we may be ſtirred up to ſtudie to partake thereof; therefore doth he ſo much incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the certain advantage to be had thereby. 2. In the matter of mans Redemption, the Son of God was pleaſed to demit himſelf in our nature to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Servant and Ambaſſadour, that we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Fathers being well pleaſed with what he doth; for, ſo much are we taught in that <hi>God ſent his Son.</hi> See, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. 3. It pleaſed the Son of God, at the Fathers appointment, to caſt a veile upon his glory, by appearing on earth in our nature, and to converſe among men, and endure all their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and enmity, that he might finiſh the work gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to do; ſo, he was <hi>ſent into the world,</hi> which is to be underſtood here of the habitable world and of men in it, and ſavouring of it; and this commendeth his love, that at his Fathers appointment he came willingly among ſuch. 4. It is as certain that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall be ſaved, as it is certain God cannot be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of his end in ſending his Son into the world; therefore it is ſubjoyned as a reaſon of that, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Believers ſhall not periſh, &amp;c. for God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, &amp;c.</hi> yea, his not ſending his Son to condemn, as he might have done, is a clear evidence of his willingneſſe to ſave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. 5.

Albeit the ſentence of the Law be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to condemn mankinde, and will condemn all them who have not heard of Chriſt; yet under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, unbelief and not receiving of Chriſt is the great condemning ſin; for, as no ſin will condemn the man, who fleeth to Chriſt the remedy, ſo when the remedy is not embraced, the ſentence of the Law is ratified in the Goſpel and Court of mercy: for, <hi>he that believeth not is condemned, becauſe he hath not believed.</hi> The ſentence is declared juſt and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a new ſentence, ſince he will not take help.

The world without Chriſt lieth in darkneſſe, void of ſpiritual light, and full of errours, and of the works of darkneſſe: God is withdrawn from the creatures, and they wander and ſtumble (as in the dark) upon Satans ſnares, their caſe is void of true peace and comfort, as men in a dark pit; their way tends to utter darkneſſe; and yet, as men in the dark, their caſe and miſery is not diſcerned in its own colours; for, in oppoſition to all, this, it is ſaid, <hi>that light is come into the world,</hi> by Chriſts being manifeſted in the Goſpel. 2.

The firſt whereof (being a proverbial ſentence, and holding true both in natural and ſpiritual light,) ſheweth, that evil doers hate the light, leſt it ſhould diſcover them; and the ſecond, that the godly, on the contrary, delight to have their wayes tried and made manifeſt by this light. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is yet in nature, and on whom Chriſt hath not ſhined with the renewing light of the Goſpel, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doer, not only in a legal ſenſe, (as all have ſinned, and the godly do ſin daily) but habitually, it is his courſe, ſtudy and endeavour to do that which diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, and this ſtudy of doing evil is the aire he breathes in; ſuch is he <hi>who doth evil.</hi> 2. The Goſpel hath not only a refreſhing light to comfort ſinners in the due order, but a reproving and diſcovering light, which (however men will ſtand as long as they are able, in the defence of their own righteouſneſſe, yet) will convince and diſcover them to themſelves: for, this is the light here ſpoken of, which <hi>reproveth</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth,</hi> or, (as the word is) <hi>argueth</hi> and <hi>convinveth</hi> men to be what they are. And albeit nature will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome groſſe ſins, yet mens ſelf-righteouſneſſe, the emptineſſe of moral civility, &amp;c. muſt be of the words diſcovering; And albeit the Law which is ſpiritual, diſcover theſe alſo, yet it is aſcribed to the Goſpel in this challenge, becauſe it aggravateth theſe ſins ſo much the more, that the Goſpel diſcovereth them with the offer of a remedy. 3. The great plea betwixt Chriſt and ſinners in the Goſpel, is about this reproving lights getting place, and about mens being diſcovered to themſelves, as being the firſt leſſon where the moſt part of men ſtick, and ſo get no more; for, <hi>they hate the light and come not to it.</hi> 4. As in the matter of natural light, evil doers wait for the dark, <hi>Job</hi> 24.15. ſo it is a mark of evil doers, that they hate the ſpiritual light, and ſhun all means of ſearching and knowing themſelves, as wiſhing ſuch things were not ſin, not deſiring to know them to be ſo, and wiſhing there were not a God to puniſh them; for, <hi>every one that doth evil, hateth the light.</hi> 5. All theſe who do not (out of jealouſie over themſelves) come to the Word, with a deſire to be diſcovered to themſelves, but deſire to hear what may flatter them in ſin, and to whom it is not only their tentation at ſome times, but their habitual frame to take ill with reproof; All theſe I ſay, do prove themſelves evil doers, and haters of the light, whatever reſpect they pretend to have to it; therefore doth he explain who are haters, <hi>neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the light, left his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> 6. A mark of a man who hath embraced Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is, (not ſinleſneſſe, but) a ſtudie and endeavour to do what is commanded in the Word of truth, and to do it in truth and ſincerity; for, <hi>he doth truth.</hi> 7. As the godly man muſt have been at the light before he can do the truth, ſo this light maketh him jealous and ſuſpicious of himſelfe, as knowing that Satan and a deceitful heart may out-wit him, and therefore he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48148:26"/>
loveth ſelf ſearching and examination well, whereby he may know himſelf; for, this is his character, <hi>He cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt,</hi> not ſo much to others, as to himſelfe. 8. The godly mans jealouſie of himſelf, will not be ſatisfied in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf with others, or the faſhions of the world, or with the external duties required in the law, or in judging of himſelf, as ſelf-love would preſcribe; but it bringeth him to Gods ballance, and the light of the Word, as his Judge: for, <hi>he cometh to the light, &amp;c.</hi> 9. The matter wherein a godly man puts himſelf to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, are his particular actions, and that daily, and not now and then only; for, he cometh, <hi>that his deeds may be made manifeſt.</hi> 10. That which the ſincere man trieth in his way, and which only quieteth his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about them, is, when he findeth them agreeable to Gods direction, (whatever others think of them) and tending to his glory; when he findeth they are done by him, whoſe perſon is in God by reconciliation, and who hath his ſtrength in God, by dwelling in him by faith; for, he trieth his works, that <hi>they are wrought in God,</hi> that is, at the direction of God, and by a perſon dwelling in God by reconciliation, ſo empty in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he not only now and then employeth God, but dwelleth in him for ſtrength; <hi>To live and walk in the Spirit,</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.16, 18, 25.</p>

                  <p>Followeth in the ſecond part of the chapter, <hi>Johns</hi> laſt teſtimony given to Chriſt before his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, three occaſions wherof we have, to <hi>v</hi> 27. The firſt &amp; more remote occaſion, is, that Chriſt leaving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> came to the territory of <hi>Judea,</hi> and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized there by the Miniſtry of his diſciples, and that <hi>John</hi> (being yet at liberty) was buſie, baptizing alſo at the ſame time, and having left <hi>Bethabara</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> was come to <hi>Aenon,</hi> (ſuppoſed to be in <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> or <hi>Galilee,</hi> where <hi>Herod,</hi> who behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, had power,) and baptizing there. Their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing both at one time occaſioned that emulation, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. which drew out the teſtimony. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt was pleaſed to ſubmit unto a toſſed life, and went from place to place according as he had to do, or ſinners to convert; for, <hi>after theſe things Jeſus came</hi> (from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he was ordinarily ill-wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed) <hi>into the land of Judea.</hi> where he got work, and had occaſion to do good. 2. It is the duty of Chriſts diſciples to follow him, whitherſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and however Chriſt may get many ſleeces of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, yet it is only diſciples that follow him in well and wo; for, therefore, (and not only becauſe it was their particular calling) is it marked, that <hi>Jeſus came with his diſciples into the land of Judea.</hi> 3. Chriſts own bodily preſence, being filled with the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure for his peoples good, did not take away the uſe of external Ordinances of Word and Sacraments, as being the means in and by which he conveighs himſelf, and his grace and fulneſſe to his people; for, <hi>he tarried with them and baptized,</hi> to wit, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 4.2. he uſed the ſame means that he appointed <hi>John</hi> to uſe, that he might binde all to Ordinances. 4. The Ordinances of Chriſt are as truly his Ordinances in the hands of weak men, appointed thereunto, as if he did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſame himſelf; for, ſo is here ſaid of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in particular, <hi>He tarried and baptized,</hi> when his diſciples did adminiſtrate it: The vertue of Ordinances doth not depend on the excellencie of the inſtruments. 5. It is the duty of Miniſters to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their diligence, whatever other means Chriſt uſe to further his own work; and Gods raiſing up of clearer lights ſhould not diſcourage faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to go on in their duty: for albeit Chriſt was now getting the name, yet <hi>John was alſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</hi> 6. Whatever circumſtantial difference there was betwixt Chriſts and <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, yet in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they were the ſame, pointing out and ſealing up the ſame thing; therefore they baptize together at one time, and people go to both of them as to the ſame Ordinance. 7. Under the Goſpel the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Ordinances are not confined to any one place; for, <hi>John</hi> baptizeth in <hi>Aenon,</hi> as well as in <hi>Bethabara,</hi> with other water as well as <hi>Jordan,</hi> and Chriſt is baptizing in another place. 8. Miniſters who are free, ought to chooſe ſuch places for to exerciſe their calling in, where in wiſdome they finde maineſt circumſtances concurre for furtherance of the work of God; for, <hi>he baptized in Aenon, becauſe there was much water there,</hi> to baptize withal. This doth not by any conſequence give us to inferre that <hi>John</hi> did not ſprinkle, or poure water on theſe he baptized, but that he dipped them: for, in theſe hot countreyes, water being ſo ſcarce, that oft-times it occaſioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to get it for neceſſary uſes, as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. and elſewhere; it needeth not ſeem ſtrange that <hi>John</hi> was not permitted to make uſe of wells, even for ſprinkling the multitudes that came to him, but behoved to go to rivers and brooks where the water was copious and common. 9. Where God employeth his ſervants, he will give them ſucceſſe in ſome meaſure; and albeit God raiſe up more ſhining lights, yet the work of God in the hands of any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, will not wear out of requeſt among be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for, when Chriſt is baptizing, yet <hi>they came and were baptized by John.</hi> 10. The moſt faithful of Gods ſervants may expect hard meaſure from the world for their pains, and that they will do what they can to impede them in their work; for, it is here ſuppoſed that <hi>John was caſt in priſon,</hi> though not yet. 11. The ſervants of God are not, upon feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to lie by of their own accord, but while they have liberty and opportunity of doing good, they ought to uſe it well, that it may further their account in a day of trial: for it is a reaſon why <hi>John</hi> ſtill baptized: for, <hi>he was not yet caſt into priſon</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond and nearer occaſion of this teſtimony, is, a debate betwixt ſome Jewes, and ſome of <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples, whether his baptiſme or their waſhings were beſt for purging of ſin; and the Jewes (it ſeemeth) having nothing to object againſt <hi>John</hi> or his baptiſm, will yet depreſſe it what they can, by caſting up Chriſt and his baptiſme, as now out-ſhining <hi>John.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diſciples, out of carnal emulation come to him with a regrate, that Chriſt who was brought in credit by his teſtimony, did now gather diſciples of himſelf; and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rie all the praiſe from him; and this is the third and neareſt occaſion of the teſtimony. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Truth will alwayes be liable to conteſt ſo long as men are carnal, and eſpecially times of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will readily breed debates and queſtions; for, <hi>there aroſe a queſtion</hi> at this time. 2. None are more bold and ready to fall on debates, then thoſe who are weakeſt in Religion, having much raſh zeal, being conceited of the little light they have, and ignorant of their own inability, and of the ſubtility of errours and hereticks; for, <hi>it was ſome of Johns diſciples,</hi> who were weak, very ignorant and emulous of Chriſt, who enter on this queſtion. 3. Adverſaries of the truth, are ſo deeply rooted in their ſuperſtitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as they will be as ready and bold to diſpute for them, as others are for truth, eſpecially when they meet with a weak party: for, <hi>the Jewes queſtion with Johns diſciples about purifying.</hi> 4. It is an old policie of adverſaries of the truth, when they can do no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to put Chriſts friends by the eares among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for, ſo it is ſuppoſed the Jewes did here, by caſting up Chriſts baptiſme to diſparage <hi>John.</hi> 5. Such diſciples as are weak, and raſh, and fooliſhly forward in debates, get more hurt then good by them one way or other; for, <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples are ſent away poiſoned with carnal emulation and envie againſt Chriſt. 6. In ſo far as men know Chriſt, he will grow in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation, and men will come down, and get only their own room: for, it is ſuppoſed that Chriſts train was greateſt, <hi>he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi> 7. Carnal emulation is an old and great ſin in the Church, and even among Profeſſors; it being the foule fruit of a carnal temper, to look on the ſucceſſe and applauſe of one mans gifts, as the debaſing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who is faithful: to count the thriving of the work of God in one Miniſters hand, the diſgracing of another who is not ſo flocked unto: to be forty that any praiſe ſhould go by our ſelves, or theſe we eſteem of; or to be taken up, not ſo much with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Goſpel and the glory of God, as with the reputation of men employed about it; for, in all theſe they failed, they think Chriſt wrongeth <hi>John,</hi> that his riſing diſgraceth him, (and therefore they give him honourable titles, and debaſe Chriſt as one that had been with him, and brought in credit by him) and the thriving of the work in Chriſts hand angereth them, ſince it brought (as they judged) their Maſter out of requeſt, <hi>Rahbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, &amp;c.</hi> See; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. 8. It is a great injury done to Chriſt, when his voluntary humiliation aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in mens hearts, when men think he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to any for giving him due reſpect, or that he wrongeth any when he is in greateſt repute in his Church; for, herein they wrong him, in caſting up that <hi>he was with John beyond Jordan,</hi> as one of his hearers, in alledging ingratitude upon him, in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to <hi>Johns</hi> prejudice, who had born witneſſe to him, and brought him in credit, and in quarrelling that <hi>all men come to him.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe, <hi>John</hi> in a general Aſſertion ſheweth, that the difference betwixt Chriſt and him (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men and men) for dignity of calling, gifts, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and ſucceſſe, flowed from a divine diſpenſation, which could not nor ſhould be quarrelled, unleſſe men would bark againſt heaven. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faithful Miniſters will be far from emulation themſelves, and from foſtering it in others: and where grace is lively, it will reſiſt tentations, which would kindle the fire of emulation; for, when they blow this corruption, zeal to Chriſts honour doth not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48148:27"/>
onely quench that fire, but ſets him on work to quench it in them. 2. Every excellency and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling men have, is from God, who diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth variouſly for eminencie in calling, gifts and ſucceſſe, as he pleaſeth; for, ſo is here imported, that God <hi>giveth from heaven,</hi> what men have in their ſeveral meaſures. 3. Men are to ſubmit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of divine providence in what they enjoy of any of theſe, and upon that ground ought to cure carnal emulation; it being neither lawful, nor to any purpoſe, to do otherwiſe, for <hi>John</hi> keepeth down his own, and curbeth their emulation with this, <hi>a man can receive (or, take to himſelf) nothing, except it be given him from heaven,</hi> from which theſe grounds of curing this diſeaſe may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 1. Any calling or gift, and any ſucceſſe men have in the exerciſe of their calling and gifts, is from God; which they ought rather to acknowledge, then quarrel what they want. 2. The variety of diſpenſations which men are ready to quarrel, is chiefly in gifts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies given for the uſe of others, and which are adorning rather then ſaving; for, of theſe the text is ſpeaking, and men have the leſſe cauſe to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel for a leſſe meaſure of theſe, if they have the truth of ſaving graces, neceſſary unto life. 3. There can be no envying of any who excell us in theſe, without reflecting on God who hath ſo diſpenſed his own gifts; for, it is <hi>from heaven</hi> that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is. 4. As no man can lawfully uſurp any calling which he hath not from God; (as they would have had <hi>John</hi> above Chriſt) ſo it will be to no purpoſe to aſpire higher, in calling or gifts, then God hath ſet men, nor will it proſper; <hi>No man can receive,</hi> or, <hi>take to himſelf, but what is given from heaven;</hi> he can neither lawfully uſurp a calling, nor think to be bleſſed in it, if he uſurp it, nor can he proſper in ſtretching himſelf beyond his gifts and abilities, or in hunting after eminencie and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by them.</p>

And this is the firſt, and a great difference betwixt Chriſt and him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faithful Miniſters, and eſpecially ſuch as have eminent gifts, ought ſo to carry themſelves in doctrine and practice; as to give no occaſion to people to eſteeme more of them then is meet, or to have emulation and envie; for, ſo had <hi>John</hi> put marches betwixt Chriſt and himſelf. 2. Let Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters walk never ſo circumſpectly and wiſely, yet people are ready to debord, and run on ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for, ſo had <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples done, though clearly warned. 3. Negligent hearing, or forgetting of doctrine preached, is the ground of much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which might be prevented; for, they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried through not heeding what <hi>John</hi> had ſaid, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had ſpoken but modeſtly of himſelf, or they could not think of a greater, conſidering his gifts; or they had forgotten this in their fit. 4. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever people may miſcarry with fleſhly emulation, yet the teſtimony of Miniſters ſincerity, in walking cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, and labouring to prevent ſuch exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies, will give ground of peace and comfort; for ſaith he, <hi>Ye your ſelves beare me witneſſe that I ſaid I am not the Chriſt.</hi> 5. Chriſt is ſo far above all Miniſters, that it becometh them to put marches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and themſelves; And he is ſo great a King, and there is ſo much need of preparation to receive and entertaine him, that it is the higheſt honour of Miniſters to be Uſhers to prepare his way; and it is their duty to prepare the way for him, by ſtirring up people to receive him, and not to ſtop the way, by obſcuring of him, or keeping people hanging on them; for, this was <hi>Johns</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and high honour; <hi>I am not th Chriſt, but am ſent before him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> proceedeth to a ſecond difference betwixt Chriſt and himſelf: Namely, that Chriſt is the Bridegroome to whom the Church is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and it is a great enough honour to him, or any Miniſter to be employed betwixt him and his people, to invite them to him, and to ſee Chriſt enjoy his own peoples affection, and them brought to enjoy fellowſhip with him, by their Miniſtry; And this made him inſtead of envying, to rejoyce at the ſucceſſe Chriſt the Bridegroome had. This difference and employment, though it was peculiar to <hi>John</hi> in ſome reſpect, yet may take in all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The relation betwixt Chriſt and his people is a relation of marriage, wherein the ſupreme, and all-ſufficient Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth to take loſt ſinners to himſelf, in a ſure bond not to be broken for every fault; doth make them one with himſelf; deigneth them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of eſtates, he taking part in their wants, and ſharing with them in his fulneſſe; and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them dignities and entertainment ſutable to their ſtate and relation; And on the other hand, his people are bound to embrace this offer, to acquieſce in him, to be ſubject unto him, and give him alone their heart and affections, not proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to any other, nor ought any other to uſurp an headſhip over them, nor urge for that reſpect and roome that is due to him alone; for, the relation is expreſſed under theſe tearmes, of <hi>bride, and bridegroome who hath the bride,</hi> and enjoyeth her. 2. The relation betwixt Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is expreſſed as eſpouſals, and under the name of <hi>Bride</hi> and <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> rather then under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a compleat marriage; Not onely becauſe it is begun here; and to be conſummate in heaven;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48148:27"/>
but becauſe, however Chriſts affection reſpects ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his peoples profit then their humours, yet it is ſtill freſh and tender toward them, as of perſons new married, or in termes of it. 3. Albeit Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do not uſurp Chriſts place, yet their office, being faithful in their duty, affordeth them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant honour, under the name of <hi>the friends of the Bridegroome,</hi> an office which was uſual in thoſe times in the ſolemnities of marriage. Wherein are held forth, 1. It is their great honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and be <hi>friends</hi> to Chriſt. 2. It is alſo their honour to be friends eſpecially to further the marriage, and that Chriſt will be honoured by their attendance, and commending and appearing for him, and by their inviting the Bride to embrace him, and being inſtrumental to bring them together, ſuch were the friends of the Bridegroom, his moſt eſpecial and intimate friends. 3. It is alſo their duty to do him honor, by waiting on him as ſervants, to receive his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, &amp; get commiſſions to deliver from him, &amp; it is their dignity to ſtand in ſo near a relation, though of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for, ſo is imported in that <hi>he ſtandeth,</hi> as ſervant and friend near the Bridegroome. Such ſervice of him is great honour. 4. It is alſo their dignity to bring the Bride to hear the Bridegroome, and it will be matter of their great joy to ſee the Church brought to acquaintance with Chriſt by their Miniſtry; for, <hi>he ſtandeth and heareth him, and rejoyceth greatly, becauſe of the bridegroomes voice,</hi> as the friend of the Bridegroome ſtanding in the Brides chamber, and ſeeing the parties brought together by his means, and himſelf admitted to be a witneſſe of the fruit of his pains. This dignity faithful Miniſters may attaine in their own meaſure, though <hi>John</hi> had it in a peculiar way, even in that which his diſciples quarrelled; to wit, his ſeeing ſo many of his followers imbrace the Meſſiah in perſon, whom he had point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out unto them <hi>Doctrine</hi> 4. Faithful Miniſters, bleſſed of God, and denying themſelves, have more compleat matter of joy in the Churches thriving, though with their own abaſement, then any they could have by their own advancement, or uſurping what is not due to them; Therefore ſaith <hi>John, this my joy is fulfilled,</hi> by ſeeing people flock to Chriſt. What is an eye-ſore to envie, will be matter of joy to ſincerity.</p>

                  <p>A third difference betwixt Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> is, that <hi>John</hi> ſhining as the morning-ſtar, before him the Sun of righteouſneſſe, was to be obſcured more and more by Chriſts appearing, and his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary office of preparing the way to Chriſt, was to give place to the full manifeſtation of him and the Goſpel, which was to ſhine more and more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This is not to be underſtood of any reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in <hi>John,</hi> but of his decreaſing in the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and appearing to be but what he was, when Chriſt was ſeen. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When Chriſt is not known, he will be but little thought of, and not duly acknowledged; and then others may be too much eſteemed; for, ſo <hi>John</hi> inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that Chriſt was not fully manifeſted, nor eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of as became, and that himſelf was but too much eſteemed by many; yea, by ſome to be the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, through ignorance of Chriſt. 2. Where Chriſt manifeſteth himſelf, and is truly known, mens eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of him will be upon the growing hand, as the light ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day; there being ſuch excellency in him as cannot at once be comprehended, and the more he is ſeen, the more will he be eſteemed and accounted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and his kingdome and glory will ſtill increaſe; for, <hi>he muſt increaſe,</hi> not in himſelf, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, and eſtimation. 3. As the ſhining of Chriſt in his glory, will obſcure the excellency of other things; ſo particularly of Miniſters, not in reſpect of what they are appointed for of Chriſt (for ſo they will come more in requeſt) but in reſpect of mens over-weaning conceits. Their light and glory will be ſeene to be borrowed from him, as the day-ſtar doth borrow light from the Sunne; his ſplendor and light will obſcure and ſwallow up their borrowed light, as the riſing Sunne doth the day-ſtar; their light and ſhining will be looked on as ſubſervient to lead men to Chriſt, and not to be doated or reſted on; for, this (beſide what was ſingular in <hi>Johns</hi> calling, which therefore was to ceaſe) is imported in this, <hi>he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe</hi> 4. Carnal envie and emulation will be ſo far from getting ſatisfaction, that men who give way to it, may expect to finde moe and moe occaſions of it, and moe and moe tentations to it, in Gods holy providence; Therefore <hi>John</hi> tells his envious diſciples, that they ſhould ſee him yet leſſe eſteemed, and Chriſt more, <hi>he muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.</hi> 5. Faithful ſervants of Chriſt, whoſe ſcope in their Miniſtry is to commend and ſet him out, will be content to be abaſed and obſcured, providing he be exalted and come in requeſt, and to ſee the Maſter more eſteemed, then themſelves the ſervants; therefore, <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of this as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penſation he was content with.</p>

                  <p>A fourth difference wherein Chriſt is not onely above <hi>John,</hi> but all men, is taken from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his perſon; In reſpect of the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of his perſon, he is above all men, and all creatures.

                     </gap>d his perfect and glorious being before; for, <hi>he cometh from above,</hi> and conſequently was there before. 2. It is Chriſts prerogative to be matchleſſe and ſingular above all creatures, in glory, excellencie, efficacie of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and every perfection. He is above Angels,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48148:28"/>
above principalities and powers, above Paſtors in the viſible Church, above all the members in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body, and all things in the world are under his feet; for he is <hi>above all.</hi> 3. It is not poſſible for created conceptions to take up Chriſts excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as it is in its ſelf, but muſt point it out, by ſetting it above all created excellencie, further then which they cannot follow it; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> ſay no more to it, but <hi>he is above all.</hi> 4. What ever may be the perverſe or blinded judgments of men, yet in due time, that which is moſt eminent before God will carry the preheminence even before men, above what they otherwayes doated on; for, ſo much doth this verſe, with the former, teach, <hi>he muſt increaſe,</hi> for he is indeed above all. 5. Chriſts excellencie is indeed founded upon real worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above all, becauſe his original is divine, and from heaven; Not onely is he incomparable in his deſcent as God, but in his humanity, his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification of his nature, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof with the perſon of the Sonne of God, are from above; for, <hi>he cometh from above,</hi> or, <hi>from heaven</hi> (as it is in the end of the verſe) who is <hi>above all.</hi> 6. It pleaſed this excellent and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Lord to ſtoop ſo low, as to commend his love to ſinners, by coming unto them, to ſeek and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them and their aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction; for, <hi>be cometh from above.</hi> 7. Albeit Chriſt, by coming on earth, did put a veile upon his glory, yet his ſtooping did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate nothing from his ſovereignty and highneſſe; for, <hi>he that cometh from above, is above all.</hi> 8. Mans original is ſo low and baſe, and men do ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, that it is high preſumption to enter in any compariſon to Chriſt; for, in oppoſition to what was ſaid of Chriſt <hi>that be cometh from above,</hi> and is above al, it is added, <hi>he that is of the earth, is earthly,</hi> or, <hi>of the earth.</hi> Not onely is man <hi>of the earth</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the original of his body, and the union of the ſoul with it, and ſo infinitely inferiour to him who is alſo God over all, and but duſt and aſhes before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. But every man is <hi>of the earth,</hi> in regard of the corrupt qualities he hath by ordinary generation, of which he favoureth, ſave in ſo farre as he is renewed by Chriſt; and yet that is but imperfect here, and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re beneath the divine condition and ſtate of Chriſt even as man; And thus to be <hi>earthly,</hi> or, <hi>of the earth,</hi> or <hi>world,</hi> is to be underſtood of mens corrupt eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>John</hi> 8.23. <hi>James</hi> 3.15. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48, 49. 9. As man in his perſon is inferiour to Chriſt; ſo alſo in his office and doctrine, his way of it, and his authority in it, is farre beneath Chriſts; for, <hi>he that is of the earth, ſpeaketh of the earth;</hi> Whereby we are not to underſtand that their doctrine according to the Word, is earthly, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the wiſdome of the fleſh, (though indeed they be ſubject to errour;) Nor yet that their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and authority to preach it, is from the earth, or men; for in both theſe reſpects <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme and Miniſtry was from heaven: But, 1. In reſpect of mens natural condition, they favour and can ſpeak onely of things of the earth, and what they can do beſide that, is by gift. 2. Thoſe who are enabled and endowed with authority to ſpeak the things of God; Yea, ſuppoſe they be regenerate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; yet their renovation and gifts are ſo imperfect, that their way of preaching favoureth of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and putteth them farre beneath Chriſt; and therefore the beſt have need of touched lips dayly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7. 3. Their authority in preaching is from Chriſt, and as farre inferiour to his, as the earth, or the footſtool, from off which (as the word ſignifieth) they ſpeak, is to heaven, or the throne from which he ſpeaketh; and thus the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon ſeemeth to be inſtituted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> 10. It is our part to dwell much on the thoughts of the excellencie and ſovereignty of Chriſt, and to ſee it ſhining in every ſtep of his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions toward us; Therefore it is repeated, <hi>he that cometh from heaven, is above all,</hi> partly to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this point, and partly, to point him out as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in doctrine above man who <hi>ſpeaketh of the earth,</hi> which is further inſiſted on in the next verſe. For albeit he ſtooped to our weakneſſe in ſpeaking heavenly things under earthly ſimilitudes, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. yet his way and authority even in that, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether heavenly, <hi>John</hi> 7.46.</p>

                  <p>A fifth difference betwixt Chriſt and all men, is taken from his knowledge and the manner of it, All men of themſelves do but ſpeak and favour of the earth, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. and what they have above this, is of free gift; but Chriſt in this alſo is above all, having the knowledge of that doctrine which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth, by <hi>ſeeing and hearing,</hi> that is, by a clear, full, certain and immediate comprehenſion of it, as being in the boſome of the Father and upon all his counſel; whereof mens being eye and eare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of what they ſpeak, is but a ſhadow. And yet for all this, <hi>John</hi> regrateth that ſo few embrace his doctrine, of which ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is Chriſts prerogative to have the knowledge of divine truths of himſelf from the Father, and to have all others who know any thing beholden to his bounty and illumination; for, his doctrine is, <hi>what he hath ſeene and heard,</hi> in a way peculiar to him. 2. It ſets out the bounty of Chriſt, that he doth not keep up this knowledge, but diſcovereth it, that ſo ſinners may have a ſure guide and teacher, and the ſolemne teſtimony of an eye and eare witneſſe, on which they may lean; for, <hi>what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth.</hi> It is called a <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying</hi> both in reſpect of the certainty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in reſpect of Chriſts earneſt perſwading of men to embrace it, as <hi>teſtifying</hi> ſeemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.5. 3. Chriſts gracious condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in revealing the counſel of God concerning mans ſalvation, gets but ill entertainment in the world; the moſt part of men either not hearkning to him, or not embracing his offer with reſpect, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or faith, for <hi>no man</hi> (that is, very few or

It ought, and will be matter of regrate to all the friends and ſervants of Chriſt, that his doctrine is ſo ill recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the world; for, whereas <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. that <hi>all men</hi> came to Chriſt, he ſeeth rather cauſe to complaine that <hi>no man receiveth his teſtimony.</hi>

                  <p>That receivers of Chriſts doctrine do ſeale the veracity of God, is confirmed from this reaſon, that he is the ſent Angel of the Covenant, and therefore ſpeaketh the minde and truth of God. This is again confirmed from another ground, that Chriſt hath the Spirit without meaſure, as for other ends, (of which in the next <hi>verſe</hi>) ſo alſo to reveale the Father and his minde infallibly, and this alſo ſets forth his excellencie above all others. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is beleevers duty to ſtudy much, and be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that what is revealed in the Word, is the minde of God, and that it is his truth which is ſealed by beleeving, for ſo much doth this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the former aſſertion teach, that they ſeale that God is true, becauſe what Chriſt propoundeth to be beleeved, is his Word. 2. As they who are ſent of God ought to ſpeak onely what they have in Commiſſion; ſo ſending by God, and ſpeaking of Gods minde, for inviting ſinners to beleeve, muſt go together; for, they are conjoyned even in Chriſt: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. 3. Chriſt is a meſſenger ſent of the Father in a way peculiar to himſelf, not onely in his coming to the earth, but in the exerciſe of a publick calling thereupon; being the great Angel and Mediator of the Covenant, and the chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church; for, it is <hi>he whom God hath ſent</hi> in a ſingular way. 4. As Chriſts ſending, <hi>ſo alſo</hi> his ſpeaking of the minde of God, is in a way peculiar ſo himſelf; Not onely is the matter which he ſpeaketh, infallibly the words of God, ſo that it is all one to have his minde, and to be upon the Fathers counſel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. but (though others may ſpeak Gods word for matter; and be infallibly guided in doctrine alſo, yet) he hath this priviledge of himſelf, and his authority in ſpeaking is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, not onely from God, but being God who ſpeaketh, and the man Chriſt having a more divine way of uttering the minde of God then any meere man; ſo much is imported in that <hi>he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the words of God.</hi> 5. Chriſt as Mediator is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Spirit for diſcharge of his office, and particularly, for revealing the minde of God; whereby he teacheth all who are ſent on ſuch an employment, to have much need, and make much uſe of ſuch furniture; ſo much doth this reaſon of ſpeaking the words of God, import, <hi>for God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spirit unto him.</hi> 6. Albeit Chriſt as man have not an infinite meaſure of the Spirit, (though indeed in that perſon, the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwels, as being God alſo;) for that were to be no more man, but God: yet the gifts and graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are poured out upon the man Chriſt in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure farre above all creatures, for, though every beleever be compleat in him; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.10. yet as for what is inherent in them.

They, as members of the body, have but gifts for ſome and fewer uſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 4. He for all uſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. They have a meaſure of gifts, which are capable of increaſe, he above meaſure, ſo much as the humane nature is capable of, which though it be finite in it ſelf, yet it cannot be meaſured nor comprehended by us: So much is imported in that <hi>God giveth not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by meaſure to him,</hi> being underſtood of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſo <hi>Pſal</hi> 45.7.

In carrying on the Redemption of ſinners, as the matter is accorded betwixt the Father and the Son; ſo the redeemed are not left to themſelves, but are put on Chriſts hand, to purchaſe and be forth-coming for them; and all things are concredited to him that may tend to their good: for, <hi>the Father loveth the Son,</hi> (in the quality of Mediatour) <hi>and hath given all things into his hand:</hi> under which <hi>all things</hi> we are to comprehend the elect themſelves, who are in ſtead of all things to him; together with all the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit (of which, <hi>v.</hi> 34) needful for their Converſion and Salvation, which are not entruſted to our ſelves, but to him who can keep us and them, and let them out as we need: and a dominion over all things that may contribute to help or hinder his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples happineſſe, that he may order them ſo as may be for their good.

                  <p>The laſt difference, (and the uſe to be made of all the excellency of Chriſt formerly mentioned) is, that he is to be believed in for attaining of eternal life, and that without this we periſh. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Such as cloſe with Chriſt by faith, are not only ſure of eternal life at the cloſe of their dayes, but they have it here, partly, in the word of Promiſe, partly, in Chriſt who is the fountain of it, and in whoſe hands it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and partly, in the bud of begun cummunion with Chriſt, which is an heaven on earth; for, <hi>he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life,</hi> where faith only is held out as the hand to receive this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. 4.

                  <p>The occaſion of Chriſts removal was, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees began to take notice of his gathering &amp; baptizing moe diſciples then ever <hi>John</hi> did (though indeed he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized none, but by his diſciples) and Chriſt knowing of this, and what they were hatching upon it, did decline their fury, and went again into <hi>Galilee,</hi> where he had been before, <hi>chap.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The meſſengers of the Goſpel, getting ſucceſſe, may look to meet with envie and malice from Satan and his inſtruments, and eſpecially from corrupt Church-men; for, <hi>the Phariſees heard how Jeſus made and baptized diſciples,</hi> they heard it with an hoſtile minde, and with a purpoſe to do him hurt, which therefore made Chriſt to withdraw. 2. The more that men ſtudie to bear down truth, and the work of the Goſpel, the Lord can make it to flouriſh the more; and though one inſtrument be laid aſide, yet he can raiſe up another, in whoſe hands it will proſper yet more; for they who bear down the work in <hi>Johns</hi> hand (who, as ſome think, was now in priſon) finde it riſing more in Chriſts; <hi>he made and baptized moe diſciples then John,</hi> which ſeemeth to relate to that, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.26. 3. As it is an evidence of a wicked diſpoſition to have hatred againſt Chriſt and his Miniſtry, upon the very report of it; ſo it is a judgement on theſe who will not themſelves come to hear and ſee, that his way and his ſervants be ſo repreſented to them by others, as may ſtir up their corruptions, and ſet them on edge to perſecute; for, <hi>the Phariſees</hi> but <hi>heard all this,</hi> that ſet them on edge, and that (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) by no friends to Chriſt. 4. Albeit the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God may be in a very ſecure condition when perſecution cometh, and God may ſend perſecution of purpoſe to ſtir them up; yet perſecution is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſo much fruit and ſucceſſe of a Miniſtry, as is Satans eye-ſore; for, here perſecution is raiſed againſt Chriſt in <hi>Judea,</hi> becauſe he <hi>made and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed moe diſciples then John.</hi> 5. Chriſt obſerveth and knoweth how every one is affected; and be mens machinations what they will, yet none will ſteal a dint on him, but he will know their projects before-hand, to avoid them if he pleaſe; for, <hi>the Lord knew how the Phariſees heard</hi> theſe things, as he might eaſily do by his Omniſcience. 6. Chriſts diſreſpect from men, diminiſheth nothing of his true excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and worth, nor ought it to obſcure it in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts; for, when the Jewes are about this, <hi>John</hi> calleth him the Lord, which is a name of maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and dominion. 7. The preaching of the Goſpel is the great and principal work of the Miniſtry, whereof adminiſtration of Sacraments is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory; and Chriſt would not have men to judge of the efficacie of Baptiſme, as depending on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; and would have all to put a difference betwixt the outward ſeale, which any inſtrument authorized thereto, may adminiſtrate, and the thing ſignified, for which he alone muſt be depended upon; for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to teach this it was, that <hi>Jeſus himſelf bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized not, but his diſciples;</hi> which is added by way of correction to the report: he betook himſelfe to preaching as the great work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. He taught his followers to look on baptiſme adminiſtrated by his diſciples in his Name, to be as ſufficient as if he had adminiſtrated it himſelf; and by baptizing none at all, he kept that diſtance clear betwixt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and his part in that Ordinance. 8. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Miniſters to withdraw themſelvs from the plots of perſecutors, when their calling is cleared ſo to do, by the general rules of the Word, relating to ſuch a caſe and practice; for, upon this ground, <hi>Chriſt left Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and departed again into Galilee,</hi> a more obſcure place, and more remote from the Phariſees power. 9. No pretence of confidence ought to ſlacken mens diligence, in the uſe of lawful means for their own preſervation, for albeit Chriſt knew his houre was not yet come, yet he uſed means, and withdrew. 10. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſt might either have prevented or repreſſed his enemies fury by his Omnipotencie; yet he chooſed rather to let it break forth, and uſed this mean of his own preſervation; that he might fight with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his weak followers, and, in his own perſon ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie theſe means, of retiring and ſleeing in hard times, unto them; therefore, he who might have ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Judea,</hi> and driven the Phariſees out, chooſeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>leave Judea, and depart into Galilee.</hi>

                  <p>Unto this conference with the woman, ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are permitted. As, 1. That his ſtreight way from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48148:30"/>
                     <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Galilee,</hi> lay through (not the City, but) the Countrey of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and therefore he came there, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 2. That coming unto <hi>Sychar,</hi> a City of the territory of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well was, he was ſo wearied with his journey, and the heat at noon, (which was their ſixth houre) that he reſted upon or beſide the Well, while his diſciples provided meat, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. and ſo Providence ſet the tryſt with her who was coming. This <hi>Sychar</hi> is the ſame with that place of <hi>Jacobs</hi> abode, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.18, 19. called there <hi>Shechem;</hi> and this deſcription of it here mentioned, relates to that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.22. the interpretation whereof I remit to its proper place. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When perſecutors have done their worſt, neither Chriſt nor his followers will want work or ſucceſſe, ſo long as the Lord pleaſeth; for, Chriſt driven from <hi>Judea,</hi> findes both in <hi>Samaria.</hi> 2. As perſecution and exile ſhould not put Chriſts ſervants from minding their calling; and as they ſhould employ the very time of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in ſeeking to do good; ſo a very ſhort time, through Gods bleſſing, may produce great effects; for, ſo doth Chriſts practice and ſucceſſe, while he is on his journey, teach us. 3. In every ſtep of mens way, they ſhould ſtudy to have a clear calling, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for doing thoſe things whereat others are apt to ſtumble and take offence; therefore, Chriſt, however his love put a neceſſity upon him to viſit theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſheep, and he did not ſtand to go to an hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place to ſeek them; yet being the Miniſter of Circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. and having forbidden his diſciples to go to the Samaritanes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. he will have his journey thither freed of obloquie, by the neceſſity of his going that way, from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, be muſt needs go through Samaria,</hi> as being his ſtreight way, as appeareth, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51, 52. and 17.11. and is clear to them who know the ſcituation of that countrey. 4. A lawful and neceſſary calling, maketh converſe lawful with thoſe, with whom other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were not juſtifiable; for, therefore he went <hi>through Samaria,</hi> and that warrantably, ſince it was the ſtreight way to <hi>Galilee.</hi> 5. Piety and faith in God have a ſweet ſavour and ſmell, above any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie that men can hunt after beſide; therefore, is this place ſo eminent, even in Chriſts time, by reaſon of <hi>Jacobs</hi> abode, who worſhipped God there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.9, 20. And becauſe of his faith in giving that land to his children when they were ſojourners in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> 6. Chriſt took on, not only our nature, but the common infirmities thereof; and he is to be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly eyed as emptied in his humanity, as in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Godhead, for the comfort of ſenſible ſinners who come to ſuch an High Prieſt: therefore, it is recorded that he <hi>was wearied with his journey,</hi> ere half the day was ſpent: and that through wearineſſe, <hi>he ſate thus on</hi> (or, beſide) <hi>the Well,</hi> that is, even as the ſeat offered, or as wearied men uſe to ſit.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt diſcourſe betwixt them (in theſe verſes,) Chriſt ſeeking drink, both to quench his thirſt, and that thereby he might take occaſion to conferre with her; ſhe caſts up the diſſenſions betwixt the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes and Jewes, tartly checking him, that in his need he would now make uſe of her; Here <hi>John</hi> inſerts, that the diſciples, (who, it ſeems, were not ſo many as afterward) were gone to buy proviſion, as a reaſon why ſhe found Chriſt alone, and why he employed her and not them to get drink.

There may be ſomewhat betwixt Chriſt, and thoſe he will do good unto, that it were not meet that even diſciples ſhould know of it; therefore, among other cauſes, <hi>the diſciples were gone away unto the City,</hi> that they might not be witneſſes to Chriſts ripping up of her ſhameful fault in this conference; nor to her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in her diſcourſes with him. 5.

Chriſts meekneſſe paſſeth over much frowardneſſe, which he findeth in his own in the time of their Converſion, and by his goodneſſe he overcometh their ill; for, ſo much doth this reply to the woman, teach. 2. Ignorance of Chriſt, and what he hath, and is ready to give, is a great ground of ſinners miſcarriage towards him: for, Chriſt findeth this want here, <hi>If thou kneweſt, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Chriſt is then known rightly and ſavingly, when he and all that he hath are looked on as free gifted to the world by the Father, (as well as by himſelfe) and made theirs by offer to be embraced in the due order; for, therefore is he named, <hi>the gift of God,</hi> as is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following words. 4. Chriſt being rightly known, it will adde to his commendation in a ſenſible heart, that he is at the pains to come unto them, and prevent them with offers of himſelfe: and eſpecially, that he ſtooped ſo low as to take on their infirmities; therefore, alſo it is added as a raviſhing conſideration, <hi>If thou kneweſt who it is that ſaith unto thee, Give me to drink,</hi> or, that the Meſſiah, compaſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſhould be at her hand. 5.

Chriſt hath better things to give ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then any thing he can ask of them, or they can offer him: and particularly, the well of life is in Chriſts hand to diſpenſe it as he will: for, in ſtead of her water, he hath <hi>living water</hi> to give her. 7. Chriſt, who makes offer of grace before we ſeek it, will not refuſe it to them who ask it; nor will former ſinnes hinder their acceptance who come to ſeek grace; for, even to this wicked woman he ſaith, <hi>Thou wouldeſt have asked, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> 8 The grace of Chriſt, communicated by the Spirit, is compared to <hi>water,</hi> not only that he might allude to her water, but to point out its cleanſing and fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vertue, and that it will quench the thirſt of a burnt up ſoul: and it is compared to <hi>living water, &amp;c.</hi> ſpringing, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.19. becauſe it hath an enlivening, quickening vertue, and becauſe of its conſtant endurance unto eternal life, as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>

A chief deceiving principle, making men enemies unto, and careleſſe of truth and grace, is their pretence of antiquity and ſucceſſion unto it, and their deſcent from religious Progenitors; for, ſhe boaſted <hi>Jacob</hi> was their <hi>father, who gave the well,</hi> and therefore ſleighted the offer of a better, as being well enough in her own conceit. 5. None are ſo ready to boaſt of antiquity, and of intereſt in pious Progenitors, as they who have leaſt cauſe ſo to do; for, ſaith ſhe, <hi>our father Jacob gave us the well, and drank thereof himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> and yet they were but heathens who had come in the room of <hi>Jacobs</hi> children, who had forfeited their right; and however, they were far from <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſpirit, who would ſatisfie their ſoule with that which only ſupplied his bodily neceſſity, and ſerved his cattell as well as him. 6. It is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table injury done unto Chriſt, to plead any antiquity or ſucceſſion to it, in prejudice of him or his truth, or to cry up any above him; for it was her fault to cry up <hi>Jacob,</hi> and her intereſt in him, that ſhe might fleight him and his offer; <hi>Art thou greater then our father Jacob, &amp;c?</hi> 7. Sobriety and a ſimple way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, albeit it may be found among Pagans, yet, it is a notable ornament to grace in the godly: when nature, which is content with little, is not over-charged with creatures, to the diſhonour of God, abuſe of the creatures, and prejudice of mens better eſtate: and when men by their carriage declare, that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and fleſh is not their beſt part, which they care moſt for; ſo much doth <hi>Jacobs</hi> practiſe, contenting himſelf to drink of this well, with <hi>his children and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> teach us.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt, in his third ſpeech to this woman, doth not carp at her contradicting and carnal humour, but points out the excellencie of his offer, above what ſhe gloried in, from the effects of both; The water ſhe ſpake ſo much of (as all other outward contentments) could not give any abiding ſatisfaction, even to the body, but his living water ſhould have enduring and lively effects and ſatisfaction, till it were compleated in glory. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A great cauſe of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of ſpiritual things, is their ignorance of them, and of their excellencie and worth; therefore Chriſt taketh ſo much pains to clear this. 2. A ſpecial mean helping to point out the worth of ſpiritual things, is to compare them with earthly things, and take up the ſuperexcellent worth that is in the one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, thus doth Chriſt commend this living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 3. Whatever pains men take to follow after, or drink up outward contentments, yet they will finde no abiding ſatisfaction therein, and will ſooner drink them dry, then quench their own thirſt; for, what is ſaid of this water, is true of all things of the ſame kinde. 4. The Lord hath ſo ordered it, that mens outward neceſſities ſhould recurre often upon them, after the uſe of means, that ſo they may be humbled, and made to depend conſtantly on Providence, and to ſeek better things, yet with the thankful uſe of what they have. And in particular, God hath put men to much trouble to uphold a cottage of clay, and hath framed it ſo, as to need conſtant new ſupplies, that we may minde our mortality daily: ſo much doth this diſpenſation of Providence point out, <hi>Whoſoever drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this water ſhall thirſt again.</hi> 5. The water of life, albeit Chriſt did purchaſe it, yet, it muſt be his free gift to us, who cannot buy it; and his offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth a promiſe of giving it to every one who will receive it in the due order, and that indifferently, without reſpect of perſons: for, ſo much is imported in that he calleth it, <hi>the water that I ſhall give him:</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>I can give,</hi> but <hi>I ſhall give him,</hi> to wit, if he will receive my offer, and that indefinitely, <hi>whoſoever</hi> he be. 6. Who ſo partakes of the true grace of God, it will ſo refreſh and ſatisfie him, as to quench his thirſt after vanity and earthly delights, and make them taſtleſſe, and to give him contentment in the want of all things; ſo much is imported, in part, in this promiſe, <hi>VVhoſoever drinks of this water ſhall never thirſt.</hi> 7. Albeit ſuch as enjoy the grace of God in part, will ſtill need and deſire more of it, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48148:31"/>
feed in part on hunger and thirſt, while they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. yet they ſhall never fall again under a deadly thirſt of total want of this water, a ſeed ſtill remaining in them; and their mouth being ſtill at the well, they are rather quenching thirſt, then thirſtie, and when they have gotten their full draught at the end of their race, they are ſatisfied, and never thirſt any more; for, ſo much alſo is included in this promiſe, <hi>he ſhall never thirſt.</hi> 8. Whoſoever receive the true grace of Chriſt in any meaſure, get alſo the Spirit of Chriſt as the fountain, to make grace thus enduring in it ſelf, and its effects: for, <hi>the water ſhall be in him a well of water.</hi> 9. The Spirit and grace of Chriſt in believers, is not a ſtream or a pond that may run dry, but a <hi>well,</hi> and <hi>ſpringing well,</hi> of inexhauſtible fulneſſe, vertue and refreſhment; nor is it ſuch a well, which may rot and make water ill taſted, but it is a <hi>ſpringing well,</hi> ſtill freſh, and where the Spirit is entertained, formality will be a ſtranger; nor is it only a ſpring to abide within its banks, but a well of water, <hi>ſpringing up,</hi> or <hi>leaping up,</hi> and watering all about: The Spirit and grace of Chriſt floweth out in all the carriage of men who receive the ſame, making them fruitful, and never to have done with duties, (but the more they do, ſtill the more before their hand) and active and vigorous in them, as a well boiling up. It floweth out alſo upon others, unto their good and edification, according to the ſtation and vocation wherein God hath placed them. 10. As the truly godly have no tearme-day of Religion but eternity, and their deſire is to keep freſh till the end; ſo where the Spirit of Chriſt is, he will ſtill be venting of his vertue and riches from day to day, and letting out more and more to the ſinner till eternity come, wherein all the banks of incapacity, ſin, diſtance, ignorance, mortality, &amp;c. being broken down, and the windowes of heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, this ſtream and well becometh an Ocean, and grace, ſmothered here under corruption and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, gets leave to expatiate it ſelfe in glory; for, <hi>It ſhall be a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi>

It is the great fault of many, that they would be content of as much of Chriſt as may ſerve their baſe ends, and no more; and particularly, it is but a natural and carnal deſire after ſpiritual things, when they are ſought for ſupply of natural imperfections and wants, and for the accompliſhment of natural imagined happineſſe; for, ſuch was her deſire, <hi>Give me this water that I thirſt not, neither come hither to draw.</hi>

                  <p>At this fourth ſpeech we may begin the ſecond part of the conference, wherein Chriſt having prevailed, ſo little by his offer and commendation of free grace, doth now diſcover her miſerie unto her, whereby ſhe is at length, and by degrees brought to know him. Therefore he bids her go call her husband, and bring him with her, and ſhe denying ſhe had any, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her ingenuity, and lets her ſee that he knew her lewdneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As grace is little known or eſteemed of, ſo long as we know not our miſery, ſo where the offer of mercy doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, Chriſt will diſcover their miſerie to his own, to make them either come quickly to him, or elſe reſolve on hell; for, therefore after the former offers had no ſucceſſe, doth he rip up her boſome. 2. Chriſt is very meek and tender, even in diſcovering of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to men, ſo long as they are not incorrigible, and is willing that they ſhould judge and accuſe themſelves, that he may deal tenderly with them; therefore doth he ſo mildly bid her, <hi>Go call thy husband,</hi> that he might draw a confeſſion out of her own mouth, 3. It is not every ſin whereof natural men are guiltie, for which they can at firſt be capable of conviction; for, every ſin will not be odious to every one in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but there are ſome ſinnes which only grace, and much grace, and grace in exerciſe will ſee to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: therefore, though ſhe was guilty of many other ſins, yet Chriſt pitcheth only on this ſin of groſſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, as that which would be ſeen beſt by her. 4. It is not every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ight of ſin that will convince the ſinner, but Chriſt muſt put it home upon the conſcience, and diſcover ſin to be marked by his all-ſearching eye, before it work upon him; for, ſhe knew her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, (and therefore ſaith, <hi>I have no husband,</hi> as ſhifting the matter whereof ſhe ſuppoſed him to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,) but without any ſenſe, till he rip up her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and let her ſee he knew her. 5. Chriſt will commend a ſmall good under much droſſe; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48148:32"/>
he accounts of a true acknowledgement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of an hainous crime, as a commendable duty. Therefore doth he make ſo much of her confeſſion, <hi>Thou haſt well ſaid, thou ſaideſt truly.</hi> 6 Chriſt hath particular knowledge of what ſinnes men are lying in, how hid ſoever; and particularly, he hath an eye upon ſecret uncleanneſſe; and how loath ſoever ſinners be to be diſcovered by Chriſt, yet where he pleaſeth, and hath a purpoſe of mercy, no ſhiftings will hide them; ſo much doth this large diſcovery after her ſhifting confeſſion, teach, <hi>Thou haſt had five husbands, and he whom thou haſt, is not thy husband,</hi> 7.

The work of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the elect, may have weak beginnings at the firſt, and very apparent high thoughts of Chriſt, may come far ſhort of his worth: for, in her to <hi>perceive him a Prophet,</hi> was very much, yet far beneath what he was, and what ſhe knew him after to be; for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt was indeed a Prophet in a ſuperexcellent manner, yet ſhe as yet ſaw nothing in him above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophets. 3. The Lord may ſee it fit to awaken and convert a great ſinner very gently at firſt; that ſo he may ſhew his abundant tender mercy, that they may not be deterred from cloſing with him; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that ſuch as live at a great diſtance from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the ſociety of Gods people, may not be overcharged with difficulties which they cannot there alone get through; ſo much appeareth in his dealing with this woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> a ſtranger. 4 The Lord in his holy Providence hath ſo ordered, as there will be controverſies about the way of truth and his worſhip, that the godly may be ſtirred up to ſtudie and embrace the truth more affectionately, and that he may have a ready plague of ſtrong deluſions and lies, for them who receive not the truth in love; ſo much may we gather from this controverſie betwixt the Jewes and the Samaritanes. 5. It is a neceſſary and commendable duty in ſuch as profeſſe the true God, not to be ignorant of the matters of Religion, nor of the controverſies that fall out about it; for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this prophane Samaritane had knowledge of this controverſie, and of the grounds they had for it, yea, ſhe knew the Meſſiah was to come, <hi>v.</hi> 25. 6. A wakened conſcience will be careful to lay the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of Religion ſure, and men being ſerious about getting of heaven, they will be diligent to know the right way, and for this end will omit no occaſion of getting light; ſo much may be gathered from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that taking him for a Prophet, ſhe propounds that grand queſtion unto him, to get reſolution, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to think ſhe ſtarted that national difference, to ſhift any diſcourſe about her own vileneſſe. 7. A wakened conſcience is alwayes ſo jealous of it ſelf, and its way in matters of controverſie, as to omit no mean of information; and ſuch as embrace ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and a falſe way of Religion can never be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, nor have ſound peace, as they will finde when the conſcience is put to it; therefore the firſt ſcruple that preſents it ſelf, is this queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their way of worſhip. 8. It is no new thing to ſee Antiquity oppoſed to Chriſts own expreſſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: And Antiquity, and the practice of ſome, is a crooked rule to follow, when it contradicts the current of the Scriptures; yea, and of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſuch as are commended therein; ſuch was the Samaritanes pretences; <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain, &amp;c.</hi> when yet God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another place, and the godly in their times fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented it.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt, in diſcuſſing of this queſtion, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two aſſertions; firſt, that both theſe wayes of worſhip were to give place to a better: For, the time was approaching, (at his death, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable burial of the ceremonies,) that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and lawful worſhip of God ſhould not be aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to any certain place, and ſo the Samaritane worſhip, becauſe unlawful, and the Jewiſh way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe temporary, ſhould be aboliſhed, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall be broken down. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is great wiſdome in diſcovering of errours and falſe-wayes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48148:32"/>
ſo to point them out, as thoſe who are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be brought from them, not to another way not much better, but to the right way indeed; Therefore, Chriſt takes paines, in the firſt place, not onely to draw her off Samaritaniſme, but from the Jewiſh way alſo which was to be aboliſhed, to Chriſtianity. 2. There was a time wherein it was lawful and ordained that the publick worſhip of God ſhould be at one certaine place, to wit, at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and that under ſhadowes they ſhould finde out Chriſt; for, while he ſaith, <hi>the hour cometh,</hi> wherein it ſhall not be ſo, he implyeth that before it was ſo, and that lawfully. 3. God may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully change the way of his worſhip when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſeeing any thing is therefore worſhip and lawful in it, onely becauſe he appointeth it; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt foretel the Lords changing of the Jewiſh way of worſhip. 4. After Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and death, the publick worſhip of God is no more aſcribed to any certain place, or Nation, nor to be performed in types and ſhadowes, ſo much doth this aſſertion teach us, <hi>the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor at Jeruſalem worſhip,</hi> compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 23. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Otherwiſe it was lawful to have Goſpel worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Apoſtles had, but not there more then in another place; And many Jewes were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and worſhippers of God, though not they and their Proſelytes onely. This partition-wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be aboliſhed by Chriſts doctrine in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and was quite aboliſhed of right, by his death, though the Jewes had an indulgence for their way, till the honourable burial of the ceremonies in the deſtruction of the Temple, which was the publick place where the moſt of theſe ceremonies, and the moſt ſolemne of them, were acted and gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and were thereunto aſtricted by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. 5. True worſhip, as it muſt have Gods command, ſo it muſt be performed to him as a Father, apprehended to be ſo through Chriſt, and muſt flow from a ſilial affection; Therefore, it is called a <hi>worſhipping the Father,</hi> importing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and affection which worſhippers do (at leaſt) pretend unto. 6. Such is the power of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying Goſpel diſpenſations, as will not onely diſcover the ill of contrary wayes, but actually make them give place thereunto; for, ſo much are we taught, in that Chriſt aſſures, not onely that we <hi>ſhould not,</hi> but <hi>ſhall not,</hi> ſo worſhip, and thus have we ſeen it accompliſhed. 7. Men are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſo rooted in their opinions and errours which they have drunk in, that it is very hard to drive them from them; Therefore, muſt Chriſt preſſe this, <hi>woman beleeve me.</hi> 8. As the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be taken up by faith, and not by ſenſe or reaſon; ſo Chriſt is worthy to be beleeved, and his word is a warrant ſufficient for faith, how little ſoever he be credited; for, ſaith he, <hi>woman beleeve me.</hi> 9. Chriſt not onely revealeth ground ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our faith, but ſuch is his tenderneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our weall, that he will even entreat for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at our hands, and be our ſupplicant that we would diſcharge our duty, for our own good; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he entreat, <hi>woman beleeve me.</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond aſſertion, Chriſt ſpeaks to her queſtion more diſtinctly; and left from what he had ſaid of the aboliſhing of both for the time to come, and of their giving place to that ſpiritual worſhip, ſhe ſhould gather that they were both in themſelves (at leaſt) equal; Therefore he here ſpeaks of both theſe wayes, being compared each with other, and in reſpect of their uſe till that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time ſhould come; and in this reſpect he condemnes the Samaritan worſhip, as being an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant way, and wanting warrant of the word, and preferreth the Jewes, as having clear ground for their worſhip, and it being pointed out in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the way to heaven and ſalvation; The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alſo being to come of them, and the doctrine of ſalvation, which was among them, being to go out from them into all the world; according to the Prophecie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No good intentions, no zeale, or pretence whatſoever, can juſtifie any thing in Gods worſhip which hath not ſure warrant of the Word, and is not gone about in the knowledge and faith thereof; So much is included in this reproof of the Samaritans, and commendation of the Jewes, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip.</hi> To tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe this rule, and to take in any device of men in Gods worſhip, doth in ſo farre make the true God an Idol, as to imagine him to be ſuch a one as will accept of ſuch falſe worſhip. 2. Chriſt, as he took on the forme of a ſervant, is content to rank himſelf with the true Church as a member, to teach all to eſteeme highly of ſuch a ſociety; <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>know what we worſhip.</hi> 3. Not onely is worſhip deviſed by men not warrantable, but it is not the way to heaven, ſeeing there can be no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but in Gods inſtitute way; And the caſe of theſe who follow deviſed worſhip, is ſo much the more dangerous if they want alſo the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in matters of faith and manners; Both theſe are included in this reaſon, <hi>for, ſalvation is of the Jewes,</hi> that ſalvation was to be found in that Church, their way of worſhip being appointed and approven of God, and the ſaving doctrine and oracles of God concerning faith, worſhip and manners being alſo committed to them, and among them. 4. It was the ſpecial priviledge of the Jewes, and a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Gods approving of them as his Church, that the Saviour of ſinners was to come of them, and the doctrine of ſalvation pointing him out, to ſound from among them in all the earth; ſo much alſo doth this reaſoning import, as hath beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt returneth to enlarge and explain his firſt aſſertion, and ſheweth what is to come in place of the Jewiſh worſhip to be aboliſhed; to wit, that the time was even at hand, wherein not onely there ſhould be no diſtinction of place or Nations, in the matter of worſhip, but in place of carnal and typical worſhip, performed by the Jewes in one place, all true worſhippers in every place, ſhould worſhip in ſpirit, and truth; For which he giveth two reaſons, firſt, that God requireth ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſecondly, that this is moſt agreeable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his ſpiritual nature. As for theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of worſhip, <hi>in ſpirit and truth,</hi> they muſt be taken in oppoſition to the properties of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer worſhip, and ſo they come to one in ſubſtance, that in ſtead of external ceremonies, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led carnal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. and 9.10. and <hi>ſhadowes, Heb.</hi> 10.1. the Lord would have a ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the truth of what was repreſented by theſe ſhadowes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15, 16. And this agreeth well with the reaſons ſubjoyned; for, however the Lord did require, and was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with theſe external formes, in the infancie of the Church; yet he never did accept of them, ſave in ſo farre as they led to this, which is ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to his nature, and were not reſted on by the worſhipper, But we may further extend theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, not onely to the matter of worſhip, but to the manner of it alſo, that the Lord, who is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, doth require that lawful worſhip ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſpirit, as oppoſite to a formal way of worſhip, and in <hi>truth,</hi> as oppoſite to hypocriſie; Not that God did approve of the want of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that by the removal of theſe external rites, wherewith worſhippers were much taken up, and which the beſt ſaw not clearly enough through, he was to diſcover this way more fully, and make them more free to attend it; and by pouring out of his ſpirit, he was to work it more generally. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The correction and reformation of the worſhip of God was reſerved for the dayes of the Goſpel; and to be brought about by Chriſt; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>the hour cometh, and now is,</hi> when this change ſhall be; He ſaith, <hi>Now is,</hi> either becauſe it was inſtantly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his death, or becauſe he was even now beginning this reformation by his Miniſtry. 2. They who profeſſe themſelves worſhippers of the true God, ought to performe it with humble and affectionate reverence, and with ſubjection and ſubmiſſion to him, conſidering his majeſty and their owne vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for, ſo much doth the word rendered <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers</hi> import, being a ſimilitude taken from dogs fawning and caſting themſelves down at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters feet. 3. Albeit all who profeſſe the true God, and are not avowed Atheiſts, will have ſome ſort of worſhip; yet all of them will not be found true and approven worſhippers, either for matter, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Therefore, are ſome called, <hi>true worſhippers,</hi> by way of diſtinction from others. 4. The true worſhip of God under the Goſpel doth not conſiſt in the external pomp of ceremonies and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but is ſpiritual, ſimple and ſubſtantial; for, <hi>they ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth,</hi> not in carnal ſhadowes; which if being Gods own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet did take up worſhippers ſo, (through their own weakneſſe,) as oft-times to keep them from minding this ſpiritual worſhip: how much more may it be expected, that the more external pomp there be of mens deviſing, there will be the leſſe ſpiritual truth? 5. It is not ſufficient to make an approven worſhipper, that they do not multiply rites and ceremonies, but their worſhip muſt be chiefly inward, flowing from grace engaging the heart in Gods ſervice, and from the breathing and influence of the ſpirit; not reſting on an external forme of lawful worſhip, or any bodily exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; So much alſo are we taught from this, that worſhip muſt be <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or ſpiritual for the manner of performance, as well as for its nature in it ſelf. 6. God requires alſo in a worſhipper, that, with avoiding of formality, which is but a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hypocritical ſhew of worſhip, he ſtudies ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſtreightneſſe of heart, not dealing negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, or for by-ends in Gods ſervice; for, worſhip muſt <hi>be in truth.</hi> 7 It is the Lords will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment alone that can give a being to true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to this muſt all our reaſonings about this matter be ſubject; And therefore his enjoyning of ſpiritual, ſubſtantial and ſincere worſhip ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to his people; So much doth the ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this reaſon, <hi>for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> teach. 8. All the true worſhip that God gets, is of his own ſeeking and procuring, and having wrought it, he takes pleaſure in it: So much alſo may his ſeeking ſuch import, that he ſent Chriſt to make a conqueſt of ſpiritual worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſeeketh ſuch, as being theſe he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in. 9. God in his nature is a moſt pure and ſimple ſubſtance, free of all mixture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and infinite in perfections; and he is to be conceived of ſpiritually, avoiding all carnal and groſſe conceptions; for, ſo much are we taught, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> infinitely above Angels or ſpirits of men, who yer are the moſt ſimple, pure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of creatures. 10. The right way of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God is, when men ſtudy to do that which is moſt agreeable to his nature, which is moſt pleaſing unto him; And men who know him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee that it is not carnal and outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances that pleaſe him, but that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in inward ſincerity and real ſubſtance; for, ſo much doth this ſecond reaſon, confirming the former, teach, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and truth.</hi>

Some knowledge of the myſteries of Religion may be found among thoſe who otherwiſe are very far oſt; whereby the Lord would condemne all thoſe, who being in a nearer relation, do yet remain groſſely ignorant, and all thoſe who content themſelves with notional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for, this woman a Samaritane, not only knew the Meſſiah was promiſed, but was expecting him as near at hand, in regard that things fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied before his coming were accompliſhed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that the Scepter was removed from <hi>Judah; I know that the Meſſiah cometh,</hi> ſaith ſhe. 2.

Chriſt is not far off from any, who have an high eſtimation of him, and a deſire after him, how great ſoever the diſtance ſeem to be to themſelves; for, to this woman, ſo affected, he is at hand, <hi>I am he.</hi> 6. It doth commend Chriſts great condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he not only came into the world, but was pleaſed to converſe with the vileſt of ſinners to do them good: for, ſaith he, <hi>I am he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto thee,</hi> a lewd woman, and a ſcoffer. 7. It commendeth alſo his great compaſſion towards needy ſinners, that his ſecret is with them, and that he will reveal himſelf unto them, when he lets others lie in darkneſſe; for, though, upon wiſe grounds, he forbade his diſciples to make him known, and would not himſelf anſwer many captious and tempting que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Jewes to this purpoſe, yet he will not conceale himſelf from this Samaritane, now convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of her need of him. 8.

It is no ſtrange thing to ſee Chriſts followers ſoon forget themſelves, and, being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by grace, to become ſo proud as to deſpiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for, they who were even now choſen out of the duſt, <hi>marvelled that he talked with the woman.</hi> 5. Such reverence is due to Chriſt in his working, as when we can ſee no reaſon for what he doth, yet we are bound not to quarrel, but to ſuppreſſe our own thoughts; for, ſo did they, <hi>yet no man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48148:34"/>
ſaid, VVhat ſeekeſt thou? or, VVhy talkeſt thou with her?</hi> 6. When a ſoul hath taſted of Chriſt and his excellencie, other things will be little regarded, which before were in great eſteem; for, ſo was it with this woman, ſhe came to draw water for her thirſt, and thought much of that water, but now ſhe forgot her errand, <hi>and left her water-pot, and went her way.</hi> 7. True grace is communicative of it ſelfe, and knowledge of Chriſt will make a perſon diligent to ſpread his name, and particularly, to theſe they have greateſt intereſt in; for, <hi>ſhe goeth to the City,</hi> where ſhe dwelt, <hi>and ſaith to the men, come, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Such as are kindly inviters of others to Chriſt, from any ſaving knowledge of him, they will not be content that men reſt on their report, but would have them taſte and ſee themſelves, nor will they be content to ſend others, but will go to ſhare themſelves; <hi>Come,</hi> (not go) <hi>and ſee a man,</hi> ſaith ſhe. 9. As Chriſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that men do, ſo his ſearching and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word is a ſpecial mean of Converſion, and a ſanctified ſight of one ſin, diſcovered by Chriſt, will open mens eyes to ſee more; therefore, albeit Chriſt ſpake many good words to her, yet this was the hook that catched her, <hi>he told me all things that ever I did;</hi> ſhe ſaith, <hi>all things,</hi> either becauſe that in one inſtance he gave proof of his ability ſo to do; or, becauſe that diſcovery repreſented other things to her as ſeen by him. 10. Chriſts doctrine is then effectual, and prevaileth, when himſelf is ſeen in and by it; therefore, ſubjoyneth ſhe, <hi>Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> not as doubting of it her ſelf, ſeeing he had told her, but as pointing it home to them, that they may conſider of ſuch an opportunity. 11. Weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and ſuch as have but ſmall knowledge and weak faith, yea, even women in their ſtations, labouring in the Goſpel, ſhall not want their own ſucceſſe, but may have powerful effects; for, upon this weak womans invitation, <hi>they went out of the City, and came unto him.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, we have recorded Chriſts conference with the diſciples in abſence of the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Samaritanes came to him; tending to commend the work of the Miniſtry in bringing in of ſoules. And firſt, in his own practice he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that his delight in that work entruſted him by the Father, took his minde off bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, even when he had need of it, and was more refreſhful to him then meat or drink could be. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is not only meek toward loſt ſinners, but moſt indefatigable, yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, in ſeeking their good, even to the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his own neceſſities; for, in this alſo his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples come ſhort of him, who would have him now eating of what they had bought, whereas he not only needs to be put in minde of his neceſſary food, though he had been weary and faint, <hi>v.</hi> 6. but tells them, <hi>I have meat to eat,</hi> and that delight in his calling allayed the ſenſe of outward neceſſities. 2. It is alſo Chriſts Prerogative to be the chief Improver of time, and entertainer of ſpiritual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, whereas others that are often and much in his company, may be, and too often are, very car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for, albeit it was neceſſary that Chriſt and his diſciples ſhould have bodily refreſhment, yet the diſciples in this bewray their own diſpoſition, which was yet rude, in that when others are not with Chriſt, to keep up and draw out ſpiritual purpoſes from him, they minde only meat, <hi>In the meane while,</hi> when the woman was away, <hi>his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate;</hi> wherein Chriſt reproves their temper, by ſetting on foot a ſpiritual purpoſe neceſſary for them, and emproves that ſhort while of the womans abſence well. 3. When the Lord offers an occaſion of doing good to ſoules, (eſpecially which will not ſo readily occurre at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time,) it ſhould be followed ſo far as health will permit, with the neglect of any thing of leſſer conſequence; for, ſo doth Chriſt reckon of this occaſion of doing good to the Samaritanes, <hi>I have meat to eat,</hi> it made him forget meat, and was as meat to him. 4. The refreſhments that are found in Gods ſervice and doing of his work, are but known to very few, yea, even diſciples may be much ignorant thereof for a time, and do alwayes come ſhort of that delight that Chriſt found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have meat to eate that ye know not of.</hi> They were but yet rude, and knew not this, at leaſt under theſe termes of meat, (as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> knew not Chriſt under the name of a <hi>way, John</hi> 14.5,) nor did they know it yet in experience, nor could they reach that height of delight Chriſt found in it. 5. As a carnal diſpoſition and temper is not ſoon cured, even in diſciples; ſo this is a great impediment to them in taking up Chriſts minde, while as they judge carnally of what he ſaith; for, ſo much doth their diſcourſe, till Chriſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, import, <hi>Therefore ſaid the diſciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eate?</hi> 6. Chriſt is ſo careful in helping his people, that their very neceſſities are an invitation to him, though they faile in not employing him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although they do but diſcourſe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and (out of modeſty, or otherwiſe) do not enquire at him, yet he cleareth them. 7. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of loſt ſinners is a ſpecial point of Gods Will, which he will have accompliſhed; for, Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this work he is about, <hi>the Will of him that ſent me;</hi> that men might neither look on God, as averſe from ſinners ſalvation, nor on that work as uncertain what the iſſue of it will be. 8. Chriſt is entruſted by the Father with the work of ſaving
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48148:34"/>
ſinners, and ſent into the world with a Commiſſion for that effect; therefore doth Chriſt ſpeak of himſelf as ſent of God, to performe this his will. 9. Chriſt is entruſted not only to undertake the work of ſinners ſalvation, but to bring it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as accordingly he did; for, he was ſent to <hi>finiſh his work,</hi> or the work enjoyned by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as he perfected the work of Redemption on the Croſſe, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. and did faithfully preach theſe glad tidings, and convert ſoules in his generation; ſo he ſtands ſtill engaged to ſee that whole work perfected. 10. Chriſt undertook this work entruſted to him, not of neceſſity, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and went about it with more delight then an hungry man hath in meat; that ſo he might commend his love to us; that he might teach Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be delighted in this work, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. and 3.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. and that he might teach all to go about Gods ſervice in their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as their delight and recreation; for, ſaith he, <hi>My meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place Chriſt ſtirs them up to the like affection and diligence in their calling, which he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on them from ſeveral reaſons; The firſt is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ripeneſſe of people, and their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to hear (whereof there was a preſent inſtance in the Samaritanes that were coming forth,) which therefore was to be emproved. <hi>VVhence learn,</hi> 1.

                  <p>A third reaſon, (illuſtrate by a ſimilitude) is taken from the eaſy task wherein the Apoſtles were now employed, in compariſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before them; They had much paines, as in plowing and ſowing with little ſeen fruit, but by this they had made the work more ripe for the Apoſtles, having by their preaching and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church, laid a ground for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48148:35"/>
Apoſtles ſpeedy ſucceſſe; for, clearing this purpoſe, we are to conſider, 1. This compariſon doth not chiefly hold in reſpect of the Gentiles, where the Apoſtles are ſaid to <hi>plant,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and to <hi>lay a foundation, Rom.</hi> 15.20. See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15, 16. (though in this alſo they had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Prophets doctrine, delivered to the Jewes, to confirme what they ſaid by it;) But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon holds in reſpect of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the Prophets had laboured, and to which the Apoſtles firſt Commiſſion was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.6. Conſider, 2. This Compariſon is not to be taken as if the Apoſtles took no pains at all; but it is to be underſtood comparatively, that the Prophets great pains made them come better ſpeed with leſſe pains. Nor is it to be underſtood, as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets reaped or converted none, but that their fruit was ſmall, conſidering their pains, in compariſon of the Apoſtles, who under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, reaped the fruit of their paines. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A ſpiritual minde will make good uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverbs, even in ſpiritual purpoſes, as Chriſt doth here. 2. The Lord ſeeth it ſit in his deep wiſdom, not to let all his ſervants have alike difficulties in their calling, nor alike ſucceſſe; but may let ſome be at great paines in preparing for Chriſt, and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precious ſeed, who yet will be out of the world, before any remarkable fruit of it appear; and may let others ſee very rich fruits of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their own time; for, ſo were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Sowers,</hi> and the Apoſtles <hi>Reapers;</hi> the one laboured with little viſible ſucceſſe, the other brought in many, ſometimes even with one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 3. Such as labour faithfully in the Lords work, albeit they have not much viſible ſucceſſe, yet they are neither diſapproved nor uſeleſſe, but are doing uſeful ſervice in their generation, and working to the hand of others, under whom the fruit of their labours will appear; for, ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were <hi>Sowers,</hi> and the Apoſtles <hi>entred into their labours,</hi> and reaped the fruit of their ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 4.

This alſo layeth an obligation on theſe who have long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ordinances, to give proof of their profiting under former Miniſters, by being fitted to receive the Word more fruitfully from theſe who follow after; ſo much alſo doth this ſimilitude teach, that the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was like a ripe field to the Apoſtles, as having been prepared thereto, as a manured and ſowen field: And ſuch is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others.</p>

When one can ſay but little of Chriſt, yet if it be ſpoken from experience and feeling, it may be more perſuaſive to invite men to beleeve, then much more which is ſpoken from notional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for, ſuch was this womans teſtimony of him, which was ſo ſucceſſeful; <hi>He told me all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I did.</hi> 3. As it is a commendation to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwaded to beleeve; ſo when a people are ripe, a very weak mean, through Gods bleſſing, will draw them in; for, theſe Samaritanes are perſwaded by leſſe then many incorrigible Jewes had daily. 4. As true faith may be wrought by degrees, ſo Chriſt hath a great eſtimation, even of the ſmalleſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it; therefore, he giveth it the name of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

                     <hi>they beſought him that he would tarry with them.</hi> 3.

As Chriſt meaſures the time of his ſenſible preſence according to his own purpoſe, and his childrens neceſſity; ſo a very ſhort while of his company is a great bleſſing; Therefore, <hi>he abode there two dayes,</hi> only, as being the Miniſter of circumciſion, and of the Jewes, and yet that is marked as a mercie to them, whereas many now think little that his Sun ſtands ſtill in one Horizon. <hi>From verſe</hi> 41. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such as are not wrought upon by inſtruments, are not yet deſperate if Chriſt take them in hand; for, <hi>moe beleeved</hi> then would give credit to the woman. 2. Chriſt being found ſpeaking in and by his Word, will have ſuch clearneſſe in diſcovering himſelf, and ſuch efficacie in perſwading that it will prevaile with thoſe that otherwiſe ſtand out; for, <hi>his own Word,</hi> ſpoken by him, prevailed with them. 3.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that inſtruments ſpeaking, may be a mean to draw people to hearken or give ſome aſſent to truth, yet it is Chriſt himſelf who muſt work a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and faith is never eſtabliſhed till it get root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſts ſpeaking and ſealing the Word by the Spirit; and then any thing men can ſay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhort of what they finde in him, and they will undervalue mens authority, when it comes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with his; All this is imported, in that <hi>they ſaid unto the woman, now we beleeve, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> where they do not deſpiſe her as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but declare that their faith is bottomed on a ſurer ground then her word. 2. The right knowledge of Chriſt in his perſon and offices, and particularly, that he is the Saviour of ſinners offered to all Nations, is a notable mean to draw ſouls to reſt on him, and embrace him; for, this doctrine Chriſt taught to convert them, and this their faith reſts upon; <hi>We know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world,</hi> and not of the Jewes onely.</p>

The Prophets, or Meſſengers carrying the Word of God, ſhould have honour, and a due eſtimation of the dignity of their calling and gifts, teſtified by reverence to their perſons, obedience to their doctrine, and honourable maintenance, for, ſo much doth the proverb import, that a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould have <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and honour includeth all thoſe; Their being ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parents, Rulers, and Chriſts Ambaſſadors calleth for this. 3.

Since Chriſts doctrine cannot be in requeſt, where the Meſſengers carrying the ſame, are not in eſtimation; Therefore ſuch as ingrately contemne Miniſters, are juſtly deprived of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Miniſtry; Therefore is this ſet downe as a reaſon why he went not to, or ſtaid not in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> but went to <hi>Cana.</hi> 5.

The grace of God is free, and the Lord hath his elect and precious ones, even of all ranks; for, here, he gains <hi>a certain Nobleman,</hi> or Courtier, belonging, as appeareth, to <hi>Herod,</hi> to whom <hi>Galilee</hi> belonged, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.7. and it may be was that <hi>Chuza</hi> of whom <hi>Luke</hi> 8.3. 3.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods Elect never come to Chriſt till they be driven by a croſſe; and particularly ſickneſſe of children is one ſpecial mean whereby Chriſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own to make acquaintance with him; for, his going to Chriſt upon this occaſion, imports not onely that it was his duty thus to reſpect his child, but that Chriſt took occaſion of this diſtemper to draw him in to himſelf. 5. Many who come to Chriſt in trouble, do not give him that glory by faith that they ought, but are ready to limit him to a certain way of working, beyond which their faith can ſee no probability of help; for, albeit he conceived Chriſt could heale his ſonne, yet he ties his vertue to his bodily preſence, <hi>he beſought that he would come down and heale his ſonne.</hi> 6.

                  <p>Chriſt will not at firſt grant this requeſt and work the miracle, but firſt ſtudies to cure a more dangerous ſoul-ſickneſſe in this man and others, that nothing but outward miracles did at them, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them; For this was all the mans errand to Chriſt, and it ſeemes to have been the common temper of theſe in <hi>Galilee</hi> who received him, <hi>verſe</hi> 45. and of theſe in <hi>Cana, verſe</hi> 46. and therefore he deales firſt about it; And this is another ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the miracle. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a dangerous and general diſeaſe of men, not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſt ſo much for ſpiritual benefits, as for his outward workings, and not to ground their eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and confidence in him, upon his word, but on his works; for, ſuch was the diſeaſe here, <hi>except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.</hi> 2.

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48148:36"/>The Nobleman is ſo preſſed with the preſent trouble, as he little heeds what Chriſt ſaid, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats and reneweth his ſuit with more haſte and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then before; (and this is yet another occaſion and antecedent of the miracle) yet Chriſt granteth his requeſt, intimating that the miracle was already wrought, though not in his way, yet in a better; and withal, he cureth his unbelief, making him to go his way at his command, leaning to his word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is mans weakneſſe and frailty, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions with grief or fear, will draw his minde from heeding inſtructions from Chriſt, and outward vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will draw the minde from the thoughts he ſhould have about ſpiritual and better things; for, he is ſo taken up with his childes caſe, that he took little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what Chriſt ſaid, only he is ſo far humbled and preſſed with need, as not to ſtartle at a rough an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 2. Where there is preſſing need, and any ſpark of faith, it maketh a Supplicant importunate, and that he will not give over, meet with what he will, therefore, doth he renew and preſſe his ſuit again, <hi>Sir, come down, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Weakneſſe in faith expreſſeth it ſelfe in much haſte under preſſing needs; ſo much doth his ſupplication import, <hi>Sir, Come down ere my childe die.</hi> 4. Unbelief or weakneſs of faith hath moe baſe thoughts of Chriſt then are ſeen at firſt, and the more it be exerciſed, it will appear the more, for, in his ſecond requeſt, he not only a ſtricts Chriſts vertue to his bodily preſence, but limits his power further, as if he could do nothing, though preſent, if his ſon were once dead. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>come down,</hi> and that, <hi>ere my ſon die,</hi> both of which were a fault, either to limit him to a way of working, or to limit his power, as if any thing were too hard for him. 5. Such is Chriſts tenderneſſe and mercy, that when he hath reproved our faults, and we have come ill ſpeed in amending them, yet he will not leave us ſo, but will reſpect great need and weak faith, more then much unbelief and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving; ſo much appeareth in his granting this mans ſuit. 6. As Chriſt may be anſwering the maine of his peoples deſire, when they get not ſatisfaction in every particular circumſtance; and as Chriſt will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto, or limited in the way of his working; ſo his refuſal to ſatisfie his people in their way, is in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and becauſe he purpoſeth to do better; ſo appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here, the beſt this man could deviſe was, that at Chriſts coming to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> his ſon ſhould recover, but Chriſt doth better then ſo, and ſheweth it is done already, <hi>Go thy way, thy ſon liveth,</hi> or, is well. 7. Chriſt hath abſolute power of ſickneſs and health, of life and death, and with one word can chaſe away a deadly diſeaſe at never ſo great a diſtance, ſo much doth he teach this Nobleman here, that being at <hi>Cana</hi> he could chaſe away ſickneſſe at <hi>Capernaum, thy ſon liveth.</hi> 8. Chriſt can do a weak believer a good turne, and with that, amend his faults alſo, and make his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reproofes to work; for, now this man <hi>believed the word that Jeſus had ſpoken to him, and,</hi> at his command, <hi>went his way,</hi> not doubting but all would be well.</p>

Much advantage may be reaped by mens communicating their knowledge, experience and obſervations one with another, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may help each other to a more full acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Chriſt; for, the ſervants they knew the childes recovery, and the time of it, the Maſter knew the word Chriſt had ſpoken, and the time of it, and theſe being put together, they mutually draw other to know Chriſt, and his power and good-will. 5. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral favours are then indeed bleſſed, when the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods goodneſſe in them advanceth our ſoules good, and is a mean, either to beget, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our faith in Chriſt; for, ſo is it here, <hi>he beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or was confirmed in what was begun before. 6. As Chriſt brings ſalvation to the houſe he cometh unto, and may do good to the ſoules of many by one work: ſo where a Maſter of a family is brought to Chriſt, it giveth good ground of hope, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the family will do well: and however, what experience any one of a family, getteth of Chriſt, all the family are bound to make uſe of it; all this may be gathered from this, that <hi>himſelf beleeved and all his houſe.</hi>

As this Hiſtory doth not follow immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the former, (though in general, it be ſaid it was <hi>after this,</hi>) but ſeveral things intervened; which <hi>John</hi> omitteth, as being employed, not ſo much to confirme the ſame doctrine by repeating it, as to record what the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſt had omitted: ſo this is the cauſe why we cannot certainly determine what this feaſt was, at which Chriſt went up, nor is it much material for our uſe. Only we may gather from this, 1. The ſolemn feaſts obſerved by the Jewes at Gods appointment, were peculiar and proper to themſelves, and not obliging nor belonging to the Chriſtian Church; for, therefore is this called, <hi>a feaſt of the Jewes.</hi> 2. Chriſt was pleaſed to ſubject himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law, not only moral, to free his people from the condemnation thereof; but to the ceremonial Law alſo, that he might free his Church from the yoke thereof, therefore, <hi>Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem,</hi> in obedience to the Law, requiring this appearance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Opportunities of advancing the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of doing good in our ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought not to be omitted, but taken hold of, though it ſeem to tend to our own trouble or hazard that we do ſo; therefore, alſo Chriſt <hi>went up to Jeruſalem at the feaſt,</hi> though he met with trouble there, becauſe he had occaſion of ſetting out his glory by healing the man, and by preaching in that ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>

                  <p>The next thing premitted, is a more particular deſcription of the place of this miracle it was wrought at the Sheep-gate, (as the word may be read.) of which <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.1. ſo called, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the Temple, the ſacrifices were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city at that gate; or, <hi>at the Sheep market,</hi> (as we tranſlate the word) a place near that gate, where, according to the liberty granted by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14 24, 25, 26. men might provide themſelves of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; though now the corruption of men had brought theſe commodities into the Temple, <hi>John</hi> 2.14. More particularly, this miracle was wrought at a <hi>poole,</hi> which whatever uſe it had of old, (it may be, among others, for waſhing the beaſts, before they were preſented,) was now honoured with the Lords preſence manifeſted there, in curing the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all ſuch as went into it, after an Angels trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the waters, and therefore was frequented with a number of ſick perſons, who attended that ſigne, and were accommodated in five porches built about the pool. The name of this pool <hi>Betheſda,</hi> may either ſignifie <hi>the place of pouring out,</hi> to wit, of water, either into the pool by conduits, (being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48148:37"/>
that of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.20.) or out of it by pipes, for ſeveral uſes; or, it may ſignifie, <hi>the houſe of mercy,</hi> becauſe of the proofes of Gods mercy manifeſted to the ſick there. As for the time of the beginning or ceaſing of this miracle, it is needleſſe to ſearch into it, ſeeing Scripture elſewhere is ſilent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, only it ſeemeth to have begun but of late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. <hi>Doct:</hi> 1. The place where theſe perſons lay, being a place of great concourſe, and from whence they went into the Temple to worſhip, doth teach us, that it is a neceſſary meditation for men to have frequent and ſerious thoughts of their own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may be humbled, and may be ſtirred up to preſſe more earneſtly after God, in whom all is made up; this did the Lord preach by preſenting theſe ſad ſpectacles to mens view, in that publick place, as they went to the Temple. 2. Hoſpitality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward the afflicted, is a commendable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the pains that a declining people put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to in that kinde, may ſtand up as a witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others; for, though the Jewes were now decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet the pool <hi>had five porches,</hi> either built for the ſick, or now converted to that uſe. 3. Where Chriſt cometh to any place, he will be ſure to give a ſpecial viſit to the deſolate and afflicted, and to be at paines to come to them, who are not able to come to him; for, ſo is it to be ſuppoſed here, (as is afterward clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that Chriſt coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cometh to the Poole where the ſick lay. 4. From this miraculous manifeſtation of God in the Church of the Jewes, we may learn, 1. Where God continueth a Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the people be wicked, yet he will not faile to give ſome tokens of his preſence, ſpecially for the good and behoof of his elect among them. Therefore when the Jewes had now long wanted publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and were under deep diſtreſſe, the Lord giveth this miraculous proof of his preſence; to confirm them, and eſpecially the elect, that he did not forget them; to eſtabliſh them in the love of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when idolaters did prevaile over them, and to ſtir them up to expect the Meſſiah. 2. Incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and infirmites are not therefore deſperate and hopeleſſe; for, God from heaven can help that, which no means on earth can do good to; and it is his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way to interpoſe and appear, when matters are incurable and remedileſſe otherwiſe, ſo much are we taught here, in that the <hi>blinde, halt, withered, and the diſeaſe whatſoever it was,</hi> was cured, and by theſe cures on the body, the Lord giveth proof what he can do to ſouls and inward conditions, or other outward lots. 3. Means of Gods appointment, how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable like ſoever, ſhould not be contemned; every thing being therefore uſeful becauſe God appoints and bleſſeth it; therefore made he uſe of the water of this common poole, and that when it was <hi>troubled,</hi> (which it ſeems, ſhould make it more hurtful) to be ſtepped into; though, it ſeems, there was no vertue put into the water, but only the troubling of it was a ſigne of Gods preſence there. 4. Whatever good the Lord do by any mean, yet we are to ſee that all the vertue and bleſſing cometh down from heaven; for, <hi>an Angel went down and troubled the water,</hi> before that men got any good by ſtepping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. 5. It is the duty of all ſuch as are ſenſible of wants or infirmities, to ſlock to appointed meanes, and take up their abode there, as being the Lords tryſting place; for, ſo doth the practice of theſe ſick perſons, teach; who abode and lay in the porches of the pool. 6. Much ſenſe of need will make men aſſiduous and conſtant in their waiting on, in the uſe of lawful meanes, not giving over for delayes and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for, albeit the Angel went down but <hi>at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſon;</hi> and albeit he only who ſtepped firſt in, was healed at that time, and many being there, would he diſappointed and prevented by others, yet they lay ſtill waiting.</p>

Unto this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added a previous conference betwixt Chriſt and him; wherein Chriſt, being ſenſible of his caſe, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up his deſire of cure, by propounding a queſtion about it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. In anſwer to which, the man proveth his deſire, by his waiting on the means, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was helpleſſe and oft diſappointed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Not only are men ſubject to bodily infirmities, but it may pleaſe the Lord for wiſe ends, to let ſome ſpend a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, or a large part of it in ſickneſſe and weakneſſe, as if they had been born for no other end, but to bear ſuch a croſſe; for, <hi>this man had an infirmity eight and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares.</hi> See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.47. 2. As it is the duty of the afflicted to wait on meanes, ſo long as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points any for their help; ſo when Chriſt cometh they will be firſt regarded, who have been longeſt and foreſt troubled; for, as this man <hi>was there,</hi> ſo <hi>Jeſus ſaw him lie,</hi> and took notice of him before all the reſt. 3. Such as have been kept long, and longer then others under trouble, may be but reſerved for Chriſts own hand, and for his manifeſting his glory in doing of them good; for, ſo much did this man finde in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. 4. Chriſt needs no information to acquaint him with the afflicteds caſe; he taketh notice of the meaſure of their trouble, and knoweth its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for, <hi>he ſaw him lie,</hi> through ſickneſſe and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, having been ſo often diſappointed, <hi>and knew that he had been now a long time in that caſe.</hi> 5. When
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48148:38"/>
Chriſt is willing to manifeſt himſelf for the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he would have our deſires after his help ſtirred up, and not blunted by any delay; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he unto the man, <hi>wilt thou be made whole?</hi> not as doubting of it, (for his deſire had drawn him thither, and kept him there) but to quicken it up, as a preparative to the receiving of the mercy, and to give pledge to all, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſires, notwithſtanding all delayes, will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ere Chriſt give over the afflicted. 6. It is a real proof of our deſire of help under diſtreſſes, when we are ſenſible of our miſery thereby, when we give not over to wait on in the uſe of means, and when we are afflicted with diſappointments in uſing them; for, thus doth the man prove his deſire, in anſwer to Chriſts queſtion, 7. One may be in a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject like condition, and ſeeme to be neglected both of God and men, whom yet the Lord purpoſeth to do much good unto; And one may meet with many diſappointments in the uſe of meanes, who yet will get deliverance in a better and more comfortable way; for, ſo was it with this man, and ſo did he finde. 8. It may be the lot of the afflicted, not onely to be ſick and unable to help themſelves, but to be left deſtitute without any to help them; which ſheweth what mercy they enjoy, who have if it were but one to attend them in ſickneſſe; for this man <hi>had no man to put him into the pool.</hi> 9. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a token that ſickneſſe, he pleſneſſe and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are bleſſed, when theſe make us more meek and humble; for, his moan is ſuch, meekly doth he ſpeak of the inhumanity of theſe about him, and of others (who poſſibly came there after him) their getting in, while he is diſappointed. 10. It is the duty and commendation of thoſe in diſtreſſe, never to quit hope, nor weary to wait on, ſo long as there is any poſſibility of any deliverance by any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, albeit they were ever ſo long delayed or diſappointed; for, ſo did this man, notwitſtanding all he met with. 11. It is one great weakneſſe, that our hope and expectation of help and relief goeth no further then we ſee outward means, nor can we conceive what Chriſt, power and goodneſſe is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do for us, till he reveal it himſelf; for, this man hath onely his eye upon that known help, and by his regrate to Chriſt, inſinuates a deſire that he would ſhew that kindneſſe to him which others had neglected; but little doth he dreame of that which was in Chriſts heart.</p>

To this is added a more particular deſcription of the time of this miracle, that it was on the Sabbath; which occaſioned the following controverſie and debate. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Such is Chriſts goodneſſe and pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his afflicted people, as to prevent their hopes and prayers, with doing great things for them in their need; for, Chriſt cureth the man who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked it from Chriſt, nor dreamed he would do it. See. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. 2. All Chriſts dealing with his own in diſtreſſe, endeth in healing of them at laſt, how little ſoever it ſeeme to promiſe; for, ſo doth his conference with this man. 3. Chriſt is not tied to means, ordinary, or extraordinary, but can work without both when he pleaſeth; and by his word of command can do greateſt things, and cure moſt deſperate diſeaſes; and not onely command, but work that which he commands, and by his word conveigh vertue and efficacie, and give ſtrength to obey; for, he doth not take the man to the pool, but by his word cureth him. 4. Albeit in trouble, all means and probabilitie ſhould ſaile us, yet their caſe is never deſperate, who have Chriſt to go unto; So much alſo doth this inſtance teach us: Yea, ſingular afflictions, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under them, may end in a more eminent and ſingular way of deliverance, as this man found: And, long delay in waiting on in the uſe of means, may be made up with a ſpeedy compleating of the delivery when Chriſt begins; for in an inſtant the man is made whole. 5. Chriſts miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works upon, and for the afflicted, are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and through, as will make them ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they ſhould be obſerved by all; for, this command, <hi>riſe, take up thy bed, and walk,</hi> which he obeyed, importeth that this cure was a through cure, and that he would have the man ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about it, and all to remark it. 6. As Chriſt doth his great works, that his glory may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and not buried; ſo a work appointed by him for ſetting forth of his glory, may, and ſhould be ſet about, and that without any violation of the Sabbath; Therefore, he not onely commands him, <hi>take up thy bed and walk,</hi> that the miracle might be publiſhed, but alloweth it to be done on the Sabbath, not onely becauſe he was Lord of the Sabbath, and ſo might diſpence with the obſervation of it, but becauſe this was no ſervile work enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a worldly end and commodity, but a mean appointed by himſelf for ſetting out his glory, and ſo was ſubſervient to the great end of the Sabbath. 7. Such things, within the compaſſe of our calling, as tend to the ſetting forth of Chriſts glory, are to be ſet about, with a ſingle eye and heart, albeit we knew others ſhould ſtumble and carp; for, ſo did Chriſt in his ſtation, he ſtood not on the Jewes ſtumbling in commending this to be done on the Sabbath, as minding hereby to hold out his own glory in the miracle, and in the following diſpute.</p>

It is the duty of all the members of the viſible Church in their ſtations, and eſpecially of Magiſtrates and Miniſters, to ſee to the obſervation of the Sabbath day, even by others as well as by themſelves; for, theſe Jewes (who ſeeme to have beene of the Phariſees and Rulers) their quarrelling a breach of Sabbath, was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable duty in it ſelf, if the charge had beene true. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.15. 3. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and ſuperſtitious perſons may pretend to much zeale for Gods glory, when they are but naught; for, ſay they, <hi>it is the Sabbath-day, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed,</hi> as pretending to be zealous for the Law, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21, 22. when yet they were but a naughty crew. Yea, albeit it may be alleadged, that at firſt they knew not what was wrought on the man, and ſo might the excuſed in part, yet it is not to be juſtified, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ſo raſhly, before they examine the matter: As it is uſual, that hypocritical zeal is ſtill raſh and cenſorious. 4. Divine warrand is ſufficient to guard the conſcience againſt any challenges of ſin, and may juſtifie that which otherwiſe were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for, ſuch is the mans Apolgy, <hi>he that made me whole, the ſame ſaid to me, take up thy bed and walke.</hi> And albeit he knew not Chriſt particularly, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. yet he ſaw ſo much of his glory in that miracle, ſuch power in his word, and ſuch vertue flowing from him, as warranted him to look on Chriſt as having ſufficient authority to command him, and warrand his obedience; ſeeing <hi>Joſhua</hi> only an extraordinary man, was warranted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to march about <hi>Jericho,</hi> if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to take it, on the Sabbath day. 5. Where Chriſt beſtoweth a favour, or ſendeth relief to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in mercie, it will leave a ſtamp of ſubjection to his command behind it, and incline the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obedience; for; ſo is imported in this mans Apology, <hi>he that made me whole, ſaid to me, take up thy bed,</hi> and how can I decline a command, coming from ſuch a one? 6. Albeit occaſion be offered to obdured men, to ſee Chriſts glory in his working, yet they care not for the knowledge of it, but will rather ſleight it, and ſtudy to beare him and it both down; So much doth their ſecond queſtion, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. teach; Albeit the man had told them of the cure, yet they heed not that, but onely his ſaying, <hi>take up thy bed and walk,</hi> that they might traduce him as a Sabbath-breaker; And albeit it be probable they knew who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch a work, yet they will not let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but with contempt, enquire, <hi>What man is that which ſaid unto thee, take up thy bed, &amp;c?</hi> that they might brand him as a preſumptuous man, who durſt as they judged) oppoſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to Gods Law: Whereas a due eſtimation of the miracle, might have led them to judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of his perſon and commands. 7. Chriſts works and under-takings will then onely be rightly conſtructed and judged of, when he is taken up in his perſon as God, and not man onely; for, this will diſcover him to be above the Law, and that he can effectuate that which no man could; So much may we gather from their ground of calumnie, in that they take him up onely as a man, <hi>what man is that, &amp;c?</hi> 8. Chriſt may be doing ſome good to them who have no diſtinct and clear knowledge of him, it being one thing to do the work, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to manifeſt himſelf to be the worker of it; for, <hi>the man wiſt not who it was,</hi> albeit <hi>he was healed</hi> by him, and have ſome reſpect to him. 9. Chriſts withdrawing of himſelf, (which he might eaſily do in the throng, and) which is ſubjoyned as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the mans ignorance, ſerveth not onely to clear the man, that his ignorance was not through his neglect, but further may teach, 1. No preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice at Chriſt, or his outward condition, ſhould obſcure the glory of his working; Therefore he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, that the outward baſeneſſe of his perſon might not cauſe them to undervalue his working. 2. By this he teacheth, how hateful the ſeeking after vain-glory is in his eyes, for, by withdrawing, he ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the preſent applauſe of the multitude. 3. By this practice, he hath ſanctified ſuch a lot to his people, as when they are doing good, to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to withdraw themſelves becauſe of it: And he teacheth all, as not to flee trials when called to them; ſo not to thruſt themſelves raſhly on them, but to wait for Gods calling; Therefore, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to decline for a time, theſe his enemies, who might be enraged, and to ſhun their furie, till afterward that he is called out to defend his owne work.</p>

                  <p>Here we have the Jews proſecuting of Chriſt, when it was made known he was the Authour of the miracle. The way of the revealing of it was, that Chriſt finding the man, doth give him wholeſome directions how to make uſe of his deliverance, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. and he doth thankfully publiſh Chriſt to be the Authour of his cure, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. upon which the Jews do perſecute him, by traducing him as a prophaner of the Sabbath, and by plotting how to take away his life, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>from, ver.</hi> 14. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. It is a ſweet fruit of trouble, when we ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thankfulneſſe to God for deliverance from it, by frequenting his houſe and publick worſhip, without neglect of private; for, therefore was he in the Temple, giving thanks to God, as acknowledging, that though he knew not who Chriſt was, yet he had been Gods inſtrument to him; yea, Chriſts own practice, in being there, is a pattern for our reverencing of ordinances. 2. It is not only our duty, but our great happineſſe alſo, to be frequenting publick ordinances, as being the tryſting place of Chriſts preſence; for, here, Jeſus found him in the Temple, which was a benefit he little expected. 3. Where Chriſt giveth outward favours and deliverances in ſpecial love, he will give alſo ſpiritual mercies and benefits with them; And ſuch as are thankful for what they have received, Chriſt will come and give them more; for, this man with the cure, gets direction for his ſouls eſtate, and that in the Temple, where he came to bleſſe God. 4. Such as have gotten great mercy and deliverance from Chriſt, have need of direction how to guide it, that they do not miſcarry under it; and even when they have ſome good beginnings, they need yet further upſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; Therefore doth Chriſt, by his exhortation, preſcribe a diet for this cured man; and albeit he was at paines to come to the Temple to offer thanks, yet Chriſt findes it needfull to give him this warning. 5. When men have gotten deliverance from outward trouble, they ought to take heed of reſting on it, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting God, their duty, and ſouls good; So much doth this exhortation import, that being made whole, he ſhould not think he had no more to do with God, nor needed any 'other thing, but ſhould minde his duty, otherwiſe God' could reach him. 6. Bodily health, and the curing of infirmities which deprive us of it, is a mercy to be ſeriouſly conſidered, and which layeth on a ſpecial obligation to duty, eſpecially if we have been long under the infirmity, if it hath been ſad and heavy, and if our deliverance from it hath been remarkable: Therefore, doth Chriſt begin his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with this; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole,</hi> that finding now by experience, the reality and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his health, ſo miraculouſly wrought after his long and ſad diſeaſe, he ſhould be ſo affected with it, as to take with the following direction. 7, It is a ſpecial help for getting a right uſe of our condition, to ſee trouble and ſickneſſe flowing from ſinne, as the ſluce to let it in; to ſee that Chriſt knoweth men well enough, and what they are, though they take but little notice of him; and this is to be remembred, when the trouble procured by ſinne, is over; for, while Chriſt directs him to ſinne no more, it import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that ſinne had drawn on his former ſickneſſe, that Chriſt would not have him forgetting this when the ſmart of the rod was gone, and that albeit he knew not Chriſt, yet Chriſt knew him, and what he had been. Whether this man had drawn on this ſickneſſe by ſome groſſe provocation, I will not determine, but it is certaine, that ſickneſſe and trouble entred in by ſinne, and that every one hath ſo much ſinne, as to deſerve ſharpeſt plagues here, and hereafter. 8. It is not ſufficient that men being delivered, do profeſſe their thankfulneſſe, or ſee their former guilt, unleſſe the ſenſe thereof, and of its bitter fruits, and of their deliverance reſtrain their after ſinning, and ſtir them up to prevent it for the future, and ſo be reformed by Gods dealing; At leaſt, (ſince they cannot be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) they would watch diligently over it, and not let it reigne in them; So much is imported in this direction, <hi>ſinne no more.</hi> 9. Sinne is not eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided or ſhaken off, but when men have ſmarted for ſinne, and have been graciouſly delivered, and taſted of Gods mercy, they may yet be tempted, and are ready to ſinne yet more, and need caution to prevent it. So much alſo doth this direction and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, given to the man, teach us, <hi>ſinne no more.</hi> 10. The beſt preſervative againſt affliction and trouble, is, not to run every courſe which fleſh and blood may ſuggeſt for avoiding it, but to beware of ſinne, which if it hold not off trouble, yet may aſſure us that God doth correct us in love, and not in anger; ſo much doth the reaſon of this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, import, <hi>Sinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> 11. As all trouble is in it ſelfe an evil, what ever good God may bring out of it, and by it; So whatever any have lien under, God can eaſily ſend worſe; for, while he threatens him with a <hi>worſe thing,</hi> it imports that other trouble is evill, though not all in alike degree, and that God could ſend a worſe condition then thirty eight years ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He can adde to outward trouble, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.18, 21, 24, 28. and to ſpiritual plagues, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. He can ſend them both together in their extremity, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22. and can ſend eternal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments in ſtead of temporal. 12. Such as continue in a courſe of ſinning, after they have been afflicted, and have been delivered, and taſted of Gods favour, to ſoul or body; do hereby take a way to kindle divine diſpleaſures, and increaſe trouble; for, ſo much is held forth here, <hi>ſinne no more leaſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Which calleth for much jealouſie over what good things we ſeem to have under affliction, for much warineſſe, that we reſt not upon outward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and for much abiding in Chriſt, and keeping of grace in exerciſe.</p>

It is the duty, and commendable practice in thoſe who have gotten ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Chriſts power and pitie, to proclaime it, for ſetting forth of his glory, and invitation of others to come and partake; Therefore, <hi>the man departed, and told the Jews, that it was Jeſus which had made him whole.</hi> And this he did out of gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſt (whom he knew either from himſelfe, or others about him) and to invite the Jewes to make uſe of Chriſt, if they had any ſuch imployment for him. 2. Sound doctrine meets oft times with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearers, who are more enraged thereby; and honeſt minded men following their duty in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may occaſion perſecution, and yet be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as having done but their duty, and given no juſt occaſion, and ſo are free of what followeth; for, upon this mans publiſhing Chriſt to be the Authour of his cure, the perſecution ariſeth, but without any fault in him. 3. The riſing and ſpreading of Chriſts glory, is an eye ſore to corrupt teachers and people, who are thereby diſcovered to be what indeed they are, and their ſeeming glory obſcured; And perſecution is the ordinary entertainment that Chriſt, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glory, may look for at the hands of ſuch; for, <hi>therefore,</hi> upon the report, <hi>did the Jewes perſecute Jeſus,</hi> by their reproachful tongues, and deviſing how to take his life, either in a tumult, or judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. 4. Such is the cruelty of perſecutors, that, if they had their will, nothing but the death of thoſe they oppoſe, would ſatisfie them: and ſuch as are perſecutors with the tongue, and ſpare not mens names, will alſo be ready to take their lives, if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offer, and they can get a pretext for it; for, <hi>they ſought to ſlay him,</hi> upon pretence of the law of Sabbath-breaking, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.32, 33, &amp;c. And this is marked as their diſpoſition, who had ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and continued to do ſo ſtill, ſince they could go no further. 5. Great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt Chriſt, may be masked with faireſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, even of zeale for God and his commands; And ſufferers are not to expect, but that they ſhall be loaden with calumnies under their ſufferings; for, <hi>they ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabbath day.</hi> As perſecutors will think ſhame to publiſh their malice and the cauſes of it: ſo this way of procedure, maketh perſecution moſt ſharp, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. 6. What ever be the malice, deſire, or endeavours of wicked men; yet the life of Chriſt and his followers is not in their hand; but the Lord may make their malice their own plagues, and preſerve his people while he hath any ſervice for them; for, though they <hi>ſought to ſlay him,</hi> yet all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, at that time, tended only to their own trouble.</p>

Yet he is ſtill without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (even on the Sabbath) working, by preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and upholding all the creatures he hath made, without which they could not ſubſiſt a moment; and by governing and over-ruling of all things, how ſmall contingent, or caſual ſoever they be; for, <hi>my Father worketh hitherto,</hi> which ſpeech doth not exclude the time following, but ſheweth that there is no intermiſſion in that work, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26, 30. and 10.29, 30. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13.

In the ſecond, (which is poſitive, and a confirmation of the former) is declared, that the Sonne doth all that the Father doth, and the Father doth nothing without him; and withall, that there is an unity and equality of the working of the Father and Sonne, both in matter and manner. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1.

up divine and ſupernatural myſteries, we are to ſubmit unto, and acquieſce in divine revelation, what ever carnal reaſon ſuggeſt to the contrary; ſo much alſo doth his confirming this truth, and obviating all objections, with his aſſeveration, teach us. 5. As the Father and Sonne are one in nature and eſſence, ſo are they undivided and inſeparable in operation and working, and the Sonne worketh only what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worketh; for, <hi>the Sonne can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> (or ſeperate from the Father) but what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth; and that he <hi>cannot</hi> work otherwiſe, but in conjunction with the Father, doth not argue any impotency in him, but his ſtrait union with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 6. Albeit the Father and Sonne be one in eſſence and operation, yet are they diſtinct perſons, and there is an order of ſubſiſtence and operation to be obſerved betwixt the Father and the Sonne; So much are we taught, in that the one is <hi>the Sonne,</hi> the other; <hi>the Father,</hi> and ſo diſtinct each from other, and in that <hi>the Sonne doth nothing of himſelfe,</hi> which doth not ſeclude Chriſts own proper power as God, but holds out (beſide his conjunction with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that in order of working, he worketh from the Father; And it is yet further confirmed, in that he doth <hi>what he ſeeth the Father do;</hi> Which <hi>ſeeing,</hi> (as that <hi>ſhewing</hi> alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) though it be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion fitted to our capacity, and borrowed from among men, who ſhew their children their skill by acting and practiſing thereof before them, that they may imitate it; Yet it is not to be underſtood, as if Chriſts work were poſterior to the Fathers work, and done in imitation of his, as is after cleared: But it points out that unſpeakable communication, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Father communicates unto the Sonne his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will, wiſdome and power, and ſo the Sonne in order of ſubſiſtence is from the Father; and points out alſo, that the Sonne knoweth the Fathers work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he works the ſame work with him, and from him. 7. The Sonne is not only joint with his Father in working, or execution of his purpoſes, but is upon all his counſels alſo, and perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all his purpoſes; So much alſo may be gathered from his <hi>ſeeing what the Father doth,</hi> and <hi>the Fathers ſhewing,</hi> ver. 20. importing that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to all his Fathers counſel and working, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame wiſedome communicate from the Father to him. 8. Chriſts workes are not only like unto the Fathers, but the ſame in ſubſtance, as flowing from one and the ſame eſſence and power; for, <hi>what he doth, theſe things alſo doth the Sonne.</hi> 9. Chriſt, in working with the Father, acts not as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſubordinate, but as there is an unity in the work, ſo alſo in the manner of it, by the ſame power, wiſdome, liberty, authority, &amp;c. the order of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being obſerved; for, <hi>theſe things alſo doth the Son likewiſe,</hi> or, <hi>in like manner.</hi> 10. Chriſt is joint with the Father, not in one or ſome only of his workes, but in all that he doth, for, <hi>whatſoever things he doth, theſe doth the Sonne likewiſe.</hi> 11. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the Church to be much in ſtudying Chriſts excellency, to look on his working as the work of God, who can effectuate what he will, and that the works which he works, they are the works of the Father alſo, and to ſee him on all the Fathers counſels and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; whereby beleevers may ſee nothing contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all eternity, or acted within time, but what he, who is their Head and Mediatour alſo, hath an hand in; So much may be gathered from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whereby he ſets out his own glory for our uſe.</p>

                  <p>This unity, and equality in operation, betwixt the Father and the Sonne, is againe repeated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and amplified, from ſeveral conſiderations. 1. That this unity floweth from, and is conjoined with the Fathers ſpecial love to the Sonne. 2. That this communication, of counſell, and power in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is univerſal, as he communicates his whole eſſence, and 3. He promiſeth more ample proofes of this equality, then they had ſeen in the late cure, though they ſhould make but little good uſe of it. This promiſe, of more ample proofes of his equality with the Father, though it be verified in all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances, to which this is a tranſition; Yet as to them, it is to be underſtood ſpecially of his great miracles wrought afterward, of, opening the eyes of the blind, raiſing the dead, &amp;c. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. There is true love betwixt the Father and the Sonne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying their communion in eſſence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And Chriſt is beloved of the Father, in a ſpecial manner, not only as Mediator and man, by vertue of the perſonal union, but as God, he is the object of his eternal love, as being the ſubſtantial image of himſelfe, and the ſplendor and brightneſſe of his glory; for, <hi>the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. And it teacheth us to tryſt with the Fathers love, by coming to the Sonne, to be aſſured of it in him; and as Chriſt is beloved, and therefore gets the Fathers counſels, ſo by ſtudying to be beloved of God, we are ſure to get his minde and ſecrets, in ſo far as is for our good, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. 2. As the Father and the Sonne are alſufficiently bleſſed in themſelves with the holy Spirit, loving and delighting in one another, without need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the creature: So it commends Gods love to ſinners, that he would ſend the beloved Sonne of his boſome to them, and Chriſts love, who would come out of the Fathers boſome, who would have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights among the ſonnes of men alſo, and would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to himſelfe love, and an object of love from among them; And it ſhould teach all to love him who is the Fathers beloved, and in whom others are beloved: So much further may be gathered from this, <hi>the Father loveth the Sonne.</hi> 3. Gods love is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, and will manifeſt it ſelfe in effects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the capacity of the party beloved; ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that unſpeakable love of the Father to the Sonne, <hi>the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things, &amp;c.</hi> or, communicateth his nature, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and power for operation with him; which is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48148:41"/>
expreſſed in termes taken from among men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our weakneſſe, and ought to be ſpiritually taken up, and not carnally conceived of; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo theſe termes of the Fathers <hi>ſhewing,</hi> and the Sonnes <hi>ſeeing,</hi> are made uſe of, to prevent all carnal and groſſe conceptions of this inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible communication from the Father, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation by the Sonne. 4. Chriſt, as he is, and knoweth, and worketh from the Father, ſo he is not poſterior, but coeternal with him in his nature and attributes, and worketh in the ſame time with him; for, he <hi>ſheweth him,</hi> not what <hi>he hath done,</hi> but what <hi>he doth,</hi> as being joynt with him in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and working, and at all times, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his being alſo. 5. It is a point to be much and often ſtudied, that the glory not onely of the Father, but of Chriſt, as God, ſhineth in all the Fathers works, that ſo we may adore the infinite glory of our Head, and may ſee him in all that is done in the world; Therefore, is it again inculcate, that the Father <hi>ſheweth him all things that himſelf doth.</hi> 6 Chriſts omnipotency, working from the Father, is infinite, and when great things are done by him, it cometh farre ſhort of what omnipotencie can do, and will do as need requires; for, <hi>he will ſhew him,</hi> (or communicate with him in, and he, from the Father, will work before your eyes) <hi>greater things then theſe.</hi> 7. Albeit Chriſts works do ſpeak his praiſe, and his own will get good of them, and glorifie him for them; Yet moſt part of men (and eſpecially hardened enemies) will reap no ſaving benefit by them; Chriſt may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of his glory in his works, may daſh their unbelief, and make them wonder; but they go no further then ſtupid aſtoniſhment; for; <hi>he will ſhew him greater works, that ye may marvel.</hi> He ſpeaks of their wondring, as the Fathers end, and his, in theſe works, as to them, becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his glory to convince them ſo farre, and put them to ſilence; and withal, it is his righteous judgment, to give them up, to reap no more fruit by his working.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Chriſt produceth ſeveral inſtances and proofs of his conjunction and equality with the Father, which are greater then that of the cure wrought on the man. Whereof the firſt is the quickening of the dead, and raiſing them up, wherein he worketh as the Father worketh; Not that he quickeneth ſome and the Father others, but that he is joynt with the Father in theſe works, and equal with him in doing them, working even <hi>ſo, as</hi> the Father work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; not as an inſtrument, but <hi>whom he will,</hi> that is, as a principal agent, by the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and abſolute freedome of will, with the Father. This <hi>quickening</hi> and <hi>raiſing</hi> may very ſafely be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood both of quickening theſe who are dead in ſinne, and of raiſing up of all at the laſt day, of both which he ſpeaks more diſtinctly, <hi>verſe</hi> 25, 28. not excluding alſo his miraculous quickening and raiſing up of particular perſons, (ſuch as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp;c.) as a proof of what he had foretold to the Jewes, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. Nor is this conjunction of the Father and Sonne in this work to be underſtood, as excluding the Holy Ghoſt, who works from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, in this operation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10, 11. But Chriſt here ſpeaks to the preſent point in controverſie, which the Jewes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Quickening and raiſing of the dead, whether bodily or ſpiritually, is an act of omnipotencie, and proper to God onely; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt ſet it out as his Fathers preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his, as equal with him, to <hi>raiſe up the dead and quicken them.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20. 2. As Chriſts power to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the dead, is a proof of his equality with the Father, and ſheweth the infiniteneſſe of the power communicated from the Father to him: So this proof of his Godhead, and of the Fathers alſo, doth give to them who come to God through him, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of confidence in leſſer difficulties; may eſtabliſh their hearts, when nothing but om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie can effectuate what they need, and is promiſed to them; and, may give theſe who have found his quickening vertue, confidence in coming to him, to recover their decayed ſpiritual conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo much may faith gather from this, <hi>as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them, ſo the Sonne quickeneth.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17 3. Chriſt in his working, is abſolute, ſovereigne and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the Father is, for, <hi>he quickeneth whom he will,</hi> and hath the diſpenſation of his power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in his own hand: Which as it is verified in ſpiritual renovation, and in miraculous raiſing up of ſome, ſo in all his actions, to deny him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſovereignty to work as he pleaſeth, is to deny him to be God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3.

                  <p>A ſecond inſtance of this equality, (which is alſo a proof of the Sonnes abſolute power and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, in quickning the dead, whom he will, <hi>verſe</hi> 21.) is, the judging of all things, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him from the Father, who judges none without him, but by him.

But in the ſecond part of the <hi>verſe</hi> it is to be taken more largely, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and adminiſtration of all things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; and ſo it is a confirmation of the former part, importing, that the Father doth not any particular act of government without the Sonne,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48148:41"/>
becauſe he hath committed the adminiſtration of all acts of government to the Sonne, by whom, as God, he executeth them; beſide that he hath given to him dominion over all things as Mediatour, for the Churches behoof, of which elſewhere, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27 and 28.18. And while he ſaith, <hi>the Father judgeth no man,</hi> it is ſpoken according to the Jewes conception, who did ſeparate him from the Father, and the meaning is not, that the Father hath ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the government of all to the Sonne, as to diveſt himſelf of it, for that is contrary to <hi>verſe</hi> 17, 19, 20, 21. and multitudes of Scriptures: But that he doth not judge any alone, or ſeparate from the Sonne, but in and by him; and ſo the Sonne alſo doth not judge his alone, <hi>verſe</hi> 30. for the Father doth ſo communicate all to the Son, as yet he hath all. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. There is a dominion and ſovereignty exerciſed in the world, and over men and all creatures therein, whereby they are not left to their own arbitriments, or to uncertain contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie, but are under the government of a ſupreme providence; for, ſo is imported, that there is a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men,</hi> and <hi>all judgement.</hi> 2. It is the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God onely to be ſovereigne Judge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world, who having created men and all things, may diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure; who is every where preſent in heaven and earth to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne all things; whoſe omniſcience taketh up all things, even the ſecrets of hearts; whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence extendeth to all; and, whoſe power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, to execute the pleaſure of his will; for, ſo is here held out, as a proof of Chriſts equality with the Father, that he hath <hi>all judgement</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. Chriſt, as God, hath the government of the world communicated to him from the Father; he hath power of life and death, of abſolution and condemnation, and the adminiſtration of all things in his hand: So that we are to look on nothing in the world, as done by the Father alone, or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Sonne; but that all is done by him, who is alſo the Churches Head, for, ſo much are we taught, in that <hi>the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed,</hi> (or, given) <hi>all judgement to the Sonne,</hi> as is before explained. Which <hi>giving,</hi> on the Fathers part, and receiving by Chriſt, is not out of his indigencie, or to ſupply his defects (which is an imperfection, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 35.) but it is given and received by communication and participation of the ſame eſſence.</p>

                     </gap>iſts participation in divine honour with the Father, which whoſoever deny to him, they deny it alſo to the Father. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is an honour due to God onely, and not to be given to any other; conſiſting in the admiring and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of his infinite excellencie and perfection; in ſubjecting our ſelves to him, with abſolute ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, in offering up religious worſhip and homage to him; Therefore doth Chriſt prove his equality with the Father, by partaking of the ſame <hi>honour</hi> with him. 2. Gods glory and the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, is his ſupreme end in all his works in the world; which we ſhould ſet before us in all our wayes, and ſubmit in every diſpenſation whereby he is glorified; for he <hi>judgeth,</hi> and <hi>committeth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Sonne, That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>John</hi> 12.28. 3. The glory of the excellencie of wiſdome, ſovereignty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie, power, and every other attribute, is due to God from men, in his adminiſtration of the world: And men ought rather to ſtudy matter of his praiſe, then of complaining and quarrelling, therein; for, it is the very end of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, by his Sonne, <hi>that all men ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Chriſt is equal with the Father in participating of divine honour; As he hath the ſame throne, and power of adminiſtration with him; ſo no leſſe glory is due to him, then is due to the Father; for, <hi>all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 17.5. He is to have the ſame glory of beleeving in him, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. of love, fear, invocation, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knee, &amp;c. with the Father. 5. As no man hath, or enjoyeth, or acknowledgeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he who acknowledgeth the Sonne, and the Father in and through him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.23. So, however men do pretend to acknowledge one true God; yet, they cannot withdraw honour from the Sonne, but they deny it to the Father, who will not be honoured, but in and through the honouring of the Sonne; for, <hi>he that honoureth not the Sonne, honoureth not the Father.</hi> 6. Chriſt, as he is true God, equal with the Father, ſo he ſuſtaines the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation alſo of being the Fathers Ambaſſadour, ſent into the world, for the redemption of loſt man, by the exerciſe of his Mediatory office; for, ſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here, that <hi>the Father hath ſent him.</hi> And this he takes delight to ſpeak of in the midſt of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, that the Jewes might not ſtumble at that condeſcendence, wherein he delighted ſo much. 7. Chriſts condeſcendence to come into the world as Mediator of ſinners, dimineſheth nothing of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, but in the ſame perſon he remains true God, to be equally honoured with the Father; for, though he be <hi>ſent,</hi> yet he is <hi>to be honoured, even as the Father.</hi> He is an Ambaſſadour whoſe honour ceaſeth by the preſence of the King, but remaineth equal with the Father, though in reſpect of that voluntary diſpenſation, as God-man, he is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. 8. As the Father is honoured in and through the honour given to the Sonne, as God equal with him; So alſo is he honoured in his authority, by mens acknowledging of Chriſt, as ſent of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; And whoever deſpiſe Chriſt, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer injury unto God, in both theſe reſpects; ſo much alſo may we gather in that, <hi>he that honoureth not the Sonne, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth inſtance of Chriſts Godhead and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with the Father, is held out in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, relating to mans ſalvation: Namely, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel is his Word; that it requireth abſolute faith and cloſing with God through him; and that he gives perſeverance and eternal life to ſuch as beleeve in the Father through him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the great and undeniable evidence of mens giving due honour unto Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, when his Word is acknowledged and received as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and when by making uſe thereof, we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our own eternal happineſſe; So much may be gathered from the dependance from this <hi>verſe</hi> on the former, he is then honoured, when his Word is heard. For, in this work the glory of his God-head ſhineth brightly, and his love to his people is ſuch, as to account himſelf eſpecially honoured in that which promoveth their happineſſe. 2. Chriſt would have men very ſerious in the matter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming his Word, and of their own ſalvation, and would have them taking him up as very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about it, and very real in what he ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their well-being; Therefore doth he begin with an aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> to ſhew that the way of ſinners ſalvation was no ſmall matter in his minde, and that he was worthy to be credited concerning it, and to invite them to ſeriouſneſſe. 3. The Doctrine of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is Chriſts voice, who as God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the preſcriber of mens duty, and of the way of their ſalvation; an authorizer of a rule of faith and manners to binde the conſcience, and who is Mediatour, is the purchaſer of the good newes of the Goſpel for loſt ſinners; for, ſaith he, it is <hi>my word,</hi> not as a Meſſenger carrying it onely, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that the Goſpel was his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. Nor yet onely as the Purchaſer of good tydings, (though both theſe be true,) but as principal Author, with the Father of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and particularly of the Goſpel, whether publiſhed by himſelf, or by his Ambaſſadours, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. 4. Chriſts Doctrine is to be reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended and hearkened unto, and abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to what he ſaith, without exception; And for this end, he is to be heard in every meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, who is God over all, and who ſpeaketh from heaven, and who in his voice of the Goſpel, hath not that dreadful ſound, which accompanied the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.19, &amp;c. attending it; for, it is their duty, that they <hi>hear my word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> importing obedience thereunto, and attention as previous to that, and all this, becauſe it is <hi>his word.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. 5. The Doctrine of Chriſt, and eſpecially of the Goſpel, is then right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, when we bring faith, and not our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and corrupt ſenſe, to judge of it, and when it puts a ſinner out of himſelf, to flee by faith to a refuge; for, ſo is added, <hi>he that heareth my word, and beleeveth.</hi> Chriſts doctrine may be a ſtumbling block, and fooliſhneſſe, if we bring not faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 23. and whatever change the Goſpel work on men, yet it works not ſavingly, till it drive men out of themſelves, to live by faith. 6. Faith, whereby the Doctrine of Chriſt is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced to ſalvation, is not our own, but Gods gift, and wrought by means of hearing the Word: for, ſo much is imported in the order; <hi>he that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and beleeveth,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 7. Saving faith, begotten by the Word, doth lay hold on God through Chriſt the Mediatour, and reſteth on God as the proper object; for, <hi>he beleeveth on him that ſent me,</hi> where Chriſt doth not ſeclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from being the object of faith, as God, (which elſewhere he ſo clearly aſſerteth, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and 3.16. and 14.1.) more then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the Father to be the Author of his Doctrine, when he calleth it, <hi>my word.</hi> But he ſpeaks thus, partly, with reference to the Jewes conception, who thought that he and his Doctrine had nothing to do with God; therefore he ſheweth that as he was one with the Father, ſo his Doctrine tended to, and was a means of begetting faith in him; and partly, to ſhew the order of ſaving faith, that as it dare not fixe on God immediately, but in, and by the Mediatour, ſo it cannot reſt till ultimately it reſt on God in Chriſt his Son, equal, and the ſame eſſentially with him. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 8. Albeit all men by nature be lying dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and be liable to bodily death and mortality, even albeit they come to Chriſt; Yet ſuch as by hearing the Word, are drawn to beleeve on God through him, get ſpiritual life, and not onely ſhall they have, but they already have eternal life, by Covenant-right, in the bud and earneſt of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, 13, 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. and in their Head Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.6. for, of ſuch Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he hath everlaſting life,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and <hi>he is paſſed from death unto life,</hi> or, tranſlated from under the ſtate and ſentence of death, by a ſentence of life paſſed in his favours in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and put in a living condition, by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: And this is the reaſon why the beleever hath everlaſting life. See the like forme of ſpeech, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. 9. The beleever in Chriſt hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life on ſo ſure termes, that he is out of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of periſhing, and is gifted with perſeverance, till full fruition come; for, <hi>he hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> 10, The ſentence paſſed in the beleevers conſcience, according to the Word, ſhall ſtand firme, and be ratified by God, in his judging of men; for, <hi>he that hath everlaſting life,</hi> by beleeving, <hi>ſhall not come into condemnation, &amp;c.</hi> importeth this alſo. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. 11. Albeit Chriſt, being God over all bleſſed for ever, doth not ſtand in need of man, nor any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Yet ſuch is his alſufficiencie and bounty, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48148:42"/>
he delights to give proofs of his Godhead in ſaving his people, and making them happy; Therefore doth he bring this proof to confirme his aſſertion, from his being able and willing to ſave them who beleeve in God through him.</p>

However Chriſt may propound the Doctrine of eternal life conditionally, to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, yet the promiſes are abſolute in his intention toward the Elect, and he is the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker for performing all the conditions, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, when they are humble and flee to him; So much is held out, in that Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to give faith, and cauſe the dead to hear, which was required as a condition in the former <hi>verſe.</hi> 2. We have much need to be oft ſtirred up to be grave and ſerious in ſtudying Chriſts glory, and about the matters of our ſalvation, and to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to give credit to what he ſaith and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh for loſt ſinners; Therefore doth Chriſt again inculcate this Doctrine with <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> 3. The great manifeſtation of the power of Chriſts Word and Spirit, was reſerved for the dayes of the Goſpel; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the houre</hi> (or acceptable ſeaſon, to be well improven, and therefore meaſured by <hi>an hour</hi>) is <hi>coming,</hi> after my reſurrection, and pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>and now is,</hi> in ſome meaſure by my Miniſtry and <hi>Johns, when the dead ſhall hear, &amp;c.</hi> Not that he gave not proof of this before his incarnation, but it was now to be in greater meaſure, and with greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy. 4. Whatever remainders of the image of God, and what ever excellencie natural men may have; yet they are ſpiritually dead till Chriſt come unto them, being deſtitute of ſpiritual life, and of the favour and peace of God, being dead by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law paſt againſt them, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, inſenſible, and unable to help themſelves; for, here they are called <hi>the dead.</hi> 5. Such is the power of the Goſpel, as being the voice of the Son of God, that not onely will it ſpeak to them who have eares, but it will raiſe dead ſouls to life by converſion, and give them an eare to hear, and make them to beleeve; for, <hi>the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Sonne of God.</hi> 6. Such as are regenerate and raiſed from the dead, by the Word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and who do cloſe with it, and Chriſt in it, by faith; their begotten life ſhall be cheriſhed and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained &amp; carried on, by enjoyment of begun conformity &amp; communion with Chriſt, till it be perfected with glory; for, <hi>they that heare</hi> (or being regenerate, are made ſo to hear, as to beleeve) <hi>ſhall live.</hi>

                  <p>What Chriſt hath ſaid in the two former verſes, is here confirmed; that he can give everlaſting life to beleevers, and quicken thoſe who are ſpiritually dead, becauſe Chriſt, as God, hath a fountaine of life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Father, communicate to him from the Father by eternal generation. And this is a ſixth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and proofe of his equality with the Father. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The power and efficacy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for quickening and keeping in the life of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, will never be rightly ſeen nor beleeved, till we ſee that inexhauſtible fulneſſe that is in Chriſt for that effect, who hath all fulneſſe of life in himſelfe, as God, to be forthcoming to his own, as a cauſe of life in them; and when that is ſeen, difficulties will eaſily be removed; Therefore, doth he prove the truth of the former doctrine, by this reaſon, they <hi>ſhall live,</hi> becauſe <hi>he hath life in himſelfe</hi> equally with the Father. 2. No leſſe is able to beget, and keep in and cheriſh life in the elect, and to revive it when it is decaying and ready to dye, then that infinite and independent fountaine of life, which is Gods own prerogative; So much alſo doth this dependance teach; No leſſe can aſſure that the dead ſhall hear, and that the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ſhall perſevere in life, then ſuch a fountaine employed for that end. So many invincible impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments are there in the way of our quickening, and ſo many blaſting ſtormes doth our life meet with, 3. It is the propertie of God to be a living God; that independent inexpreſſible life is his own eſſence and nature, and he is the fountaine of all life in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for, it is Gods prerogative, and a proofe of Chriſts equality with him, that <hi>he hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> 4. This property of life is common to each perſon of the bleſſed Trinity, to the Father and to the Sonne; Yet the Father is firſt in order in having of it, and doth communicate it to the Sonne; for of both it is ſaid, <hi>he hath life in himſelfe,</hi> and that the Father <hi>hath given</hi> it to the Sonne, which is to be underſtood of his communicating it, in communicating his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him, by eternal generation; And as for the humane nature, this is only gifted to it in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that by the grace of the perſonal union, the humane nature is aſſumed into the unity of perſon with him, who hath this life by eternal generation. 5. The Fathers communicating of life to the Sonne, argues no inequality nor inferiority in the Sonne, but he hath the ſame life, infinitely, independently and equally with the Father; for <hi>as</hi> the Father hath it, <hi>ſo</hi> hath the Sonne; and he hath it <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> as the Father hath.

The redemption of loſt ſinners is ſo acceptable to the Father, that he will not only accept a ranſome, but will honour the Redeemer, and conferre dignity upon him, for effectuating that work; for, <hi>becauſe he is the Sonne of man,</hi> and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, the Father <hi>hath given him authority to execute judgement.</hi> See <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17. 5.

The dignity of Chriſts humane nature being united with the God-head, and his dignity as Mediatour, as it ſhines in many particular acts and adminiſtrations, ſo particularly, in that he will be the viſible Judge of quick and dead, in his humane nature, at the laſt day; wherein Chriſt, deſpiſed in the world, becauſe of his outward baſeneſſe, will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and contemners of his offer of mercy, will finde his Lambs face terrible; And wherein beleevers will finde their Advocate, their Judge; for, <hi>his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of judgement, becauſe he is the Sonne of man,</hi> doth point at this ultimately.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto Chriſt hath given divers proofes of his Godhead and equality with the Father, and amongſt the reſt, one from his quickening of thoſe who are ſpiritually dead; and hath declared his ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to abſolve and condemne, and to governe and judge all, as God incarnate. Now finding the Jewes but amazed and aſtoniſhed at this doctrine, he labours to put them from that, by producing a new proofe of his power and Godhead to be ſhewed in the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by quickening the dead, raiſing them up, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to judgement, and ſentencing them according to their works. And by this inſtance, he confirmeth what he ſaid of his power to quicken dead ſoules, by a proofe which they would think more marvellous; and holds out a particular evidence of that authority, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. wherein in his humane nature he ſhould ſo be viſible Judge, as yet his procedure ſhould prove him
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48148:43"/>
to be true God alſo. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts glory hath but little roome and place in our narrow hearts, when it is ſet before us; and in his humanity and ſtate of humiliation, hardly will men give unto him the glory of his God-head; for they but <hi>marvelled</hi> at theſe things, as that which their hearts could not receive. 2. As it is commendable for men, when Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts himſelfe and his glory in the Word, to cloſe with it by faith, and beleeving, to admire, and wonder at that infinite depth of excellency in him, which cannot be comprehended; So to misbeleeve and wonder, and be aſtoniſhed at what Chriſt ſaith, becauſe we cannot comprehend it by ſenſe or reaſon, is the great and ordinary ſinne of too many hearers; for, ſuch was the fruit of the Jewes hearing, reproved by Chriſt, <hi>marvel not at this.</hi> 3. Chriſts power for quickening and converting ſinners, and his having authority to execute judgement, ſhould not be thought ſtrange of, conſidering what he is, and that wonders are ordinary with him; <hi>Marvel not at this,</hi> ſaith he. Chriſt hath ſtill more and more proofes of his God-head to let forth, if need be, and the proofe of his God-head and power in the general reſurrection, may ſtay our hearts from diſtruſtful wondering at what he declareth of himſelfe; for, Chriſt refutes their won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dering at what he had ſaid, by this new proofe. Not that the reſurrection of the body is a greater proofe of power in it ſelfe, then the quickening of a dead ſoul, wherein all the powers and faculties of man, are prone to reſiſt Gods operation, whereas mens dead bodies have an obediential ſubjection to his power; But this proofe of his power is more viſible and obvious to mens ſenſes then the other, and more difficulty appears in the work, to carnal reaſon, which takes not up the power of ſpiritual death, and thinkes it eaſie to work on a man having a reaſonable ſoul and bodily ear, then on dead bodies having no ſenſe nor underſtanding to hear his voice; And therefore Chriſt proveth the one by the other. 5. How impoſſible ſoever it ſeem to carnal reaſon, yet it is clear from the word, that there will be a reſurrection of the dead, that both godly and wicked may receive a full recompence according to their wayes; and that for this end, there ſhall be a reuniting of the ſoul to the body in the grave, to make them living perſons againe; for, <hi>they that are in the graves, ſhall hear his voice,</hi> which preſuppoſeth that their ſouls ſhall be united to their bodies in their graves. 6. Albeit the time of the reſurrection, and general judgement, be unknown to any, ſave to God only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.36. Yet it is certainly coming, and all are bound to minde that it is ſo; for, <hi>the hour is coming, in the which they ſhall hear his voyce,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.9. 7.

Only under this, as the moſt uſual courſe taken with dead bodies, all the dead are comprehended, and by this evidience of power on them who are rotten and reſolved to duſt in their graves, proof is given how eaſie it is for him to raiſe up all. 8. This univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection will be of the ſame bodies that lived on earth, and were laid in grave, which as his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie can effectuate, ſo his juſtice, purchaſe and promiſe requires, that the ſame body ſhould receive the reward of its wayes, and that he ſhould not loſe his purchaſe; for, <hi>they that are in the graves</hi> or, the ſame body that lived, and was laid there, being dead, <hi>ſhall hear his voice,</hi> ſee <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. 9.

In the day of the reſurrection, and general judgment: there will be onely two ſorts of perſons, good, or evil, and all the godly will be reckoned to have <hi>done good,</hi> how ſmall ſoever the degree of their goodneſſe hath beene, and how many faults ſoever they have had, if their courſe and way hath aimed at good; yea, the evil deeds of ſuch as ſincerely cloſe with Chriſt, if it were but at their death, ſhall be forgotten: And on the other hand, all the wicked ſhall be accounted evil-doers, how many ſoever moral vertues they have had, or albeit they have beene painted hypocrite; and that becauſe they have not made their peace through Jeſus Chriſt: for, there ſhall be onely then, <hi>they that have done good, and they that have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> 12. Albeit there may be many miſtakes in this world, and the godly may be miſconſtructed and ſlandered, and the wicked and hypocrites may be cried up, and ſeeme to be very good; yet in the day of judgment, mens wayes will appear in their true colours, and their actions and wayes ſhall be clearly known to the Judge, who will diſtinguiſh and rank them accordingly on his right and left hand, for then it will be clear, who <hi>have done good,</hi> and who <hi>have done evil</hi> 13. According as men live in this world, and die and go out of it, accordingly will they be found in the reſurrection and judgment, without any change; for, in that day, men are reckoned according as they <hi>have done good or evil,</hi> to wit, in this life. 14. Albeit Chriſt will not reward men for their good works, as he puniſheth them for their wickedneſſe, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

judgment; Yet he will proceed in that day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their works ſhall evidence their ſtate, that they have been beleevers in Chriſt, or living in the bond of iniquity, to puniſh them for the one, and to reward them of free grace, according to the other; Therefore, will it be taken notice of in that day, who <hi>have done good,</hi> and <hi>who have done evil,</hi> See <hi>Matthew</hi> 25.34, — 45. 15. Albeit the Lord ſee it fit, for wiſe reaſons, to let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lots befall the wicked and the godly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, and albeit the wicked may proſper in the world, when the godly, holding faſt their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are in deep diſtreſſe; Yet in the reſurrection and general judgment, God will give a full and final recompence to men according to their wayes; for, the Godly ſhall be raiſed up, and brought to judgment, that they may be entered into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a bleſſed and eternal life, wherein they ſhall enjoy God and Chriſt, and the company of Saints and Angels, and ſing Hallelujahs for ever: And the wicked, to get the ſentence of condemnation paſſed by the Law and Goſpel, execute upon them; and to be in the pit, tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever; And they ſhall be raiſed by vertue of that ſentence, and by the power of the Judge, to have it executed, and not by vertue of Chriſts life and reſurrection, and their head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. for, they <hi>ſhall come forth, they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>This verſe is a concluſion of this part of Chriſts Apology, for his curing of the man, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to carry his bed on the Sabbath day, and for his aſſerting his unity and equality with the Father: Wherein, from the former purpoſe, he ſummes up theſe concluſions. 1. That he is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Father in operation, as <hi>verſe</hi> 19. having no private power of his own, (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him as a meere man;) but the ſame in eſſence, power, and operation with him. 2.

That his government and adminiſtration is moſt juſt, as ſeeking no ſatisfaction to any will of his owne, contrary to, or diverſe from the Fathers, as he is God; And that he doth this not onely as God ſimply, but as God now incarnate alſo, being the ſame ſtill with the Father, and acting in all things according to the will of God. And though as man he have a will diſtinct from his will as God, and ſo diverſe from the Fathers will, yet that did act in ſubordination to the will of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The divinity of Chriſt is a truth, that may no wayes be quarrelled, and doth call for our ſecond and ſerious thoughts; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he recapitulate his Apology, that this truth may be inculcate. 2. Such is the ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and perfect unity of the Father and the Sonne, that the Sonne neither doth, nor can do any thing, without the fellowſhip of the Father; So that in all his working, the Father is to be ſeen and taken up; for <hi>I can of mine own ſelf do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Chriſt, in the adminiſtration of all things, and executing of his purpoſes in this life, and at the day of judgment, is upon the Fathers counſel, acting from him; and all Chriſts adminiſtrations are upon counſel and concluſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken betwixt the Father and the Sonne; for, ſaith he, <hi>as I hear, I judge.</hi> 4.

The reaſon of the juſtice of Chriſts judgment, is, becauſe it is agreeable to the will of the Father, with whom he is one, and whoſe will is the rule of juſtice, as being ſupreme and abſolute Lord; Which will Chriſt, being incarnate and God-man, did conforme himſelf unto, in all things; for, <hi>my judgment is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not mine own will,</hi> (nor have any will contrary to, or diverſe from his, as hath been explained) <hi>but the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which hath ſent me.</hi>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have a tranſition, wherein Chriſt obviates an ordinary objection againſt the former part of this Apology; to wit, that his teſtimony of himſelf could not be authentick, of which alſo, <hi>John</hi> 8.13. Chriſt, by this ſentence, doth not grant this as true, for the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In reading of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture great care is to be had for finding out the true ſenſe thereof, and that we be not drawn away by what it ſeemes to ſay at firſt view, to take up a ſenſe contrary to truth, and other clear Scriptures: And particularly, words ſpoken by way of objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or, preterition and giving and not granting, are to be diſtinguiſhed from affirmations; for, ſo is this to be underſtood, <hi>if I beare witneſſe of my ſelf, my witneſſe is not true;</hi> to expound it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, were to contradict truth. 2. Albeit that men may lawfully ſpeak that which is true of themſelves, when they have Gods call unto it; Yet ordinarily ſuch is the frailty of any who is a meere man, that he is but a bad witneſſe in his own cauſe, being but a liar, and ſo ſubject to erre, being readily poiſoned with ſelf-love, in what concerneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, being ready, in what is true, to ſeek himſelf; for, upon this truth is this objection ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which had ſome colour if Chriſt had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man. 3.

As Chriſt came into the world in obedience to the Father, and to bear witneſſe of him, ſo was he aſſured to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and owned of him, and accordingly found ſo; and as he honoured the Father, ſo did the Father honour and beare witneſſe of him; for, <hi>there is another that beareth witneſſe of me.</hi> 3.

Chriſt. See <hi>chap.</hi> 1.7. 2. Faithfulneſſe is the great ornament and duty of Chriſts witneſſes, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any by reſpect, they publiſh onely what is truth, and that nothing which is truth, (be it of leſſe or more importance) want a teſtimony from them, as they are called to it; for, <hi>he bare witneſſe unto the truth,</hi> was his commendation in this teſtimony, and it is a pattern to all others; And Chriſt thus deſcribes his teſtimony concerning himſelf, that none might except that there is ſuch a difference betwixt the matter of <hi>Johns</hi> teſtimony, and what may be their trial, as to make them ſhrink, if there be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth in it. 3.

                  <p>Unto this teſtimonie of <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt ſubjoines two things. 1. By way of correction, that he needed not mans teſtimonie, nor did produce it for any thing it could adde to him, but only for their good and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if ſo be that teſtimony of <hi>John,</hi> whom they ſeemed to reſpect, might draw them to come to him, and be ſaved. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Chriſt doth ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend and ſtoop for the good of his people, as yet he will not have his greatneſſe, and Majeſty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten or ſleighted; Therefore doth he adde this correction, leſt they ſhould miſtake his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 2. Chriſt doth then get his own roome in mens eſtimation, when he is ſeene to be ſuch a one, as needs nothing without himſelf, and needs nothing to commend him, but himſelf; And when they are brought to ſee and acknowledge; That he is nothing the greater, or better, when all are for him, nor the worſe, though all were againſt him; That his truth and doctrine needs no mans teſtimony for confirmation of it, being ſufficiently confirmed by his own authority; And, That mens commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, addes nothing to him, though it be their own and others advantage, that they do ſo, Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I receive not teſtimony from man.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſt need nothing of himſelf, but is alſufficient and infinitely glorious; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends much to mans weakneſſe, and for his good; for, albeit, <hi>he receive not teſtimony from man,</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>theſe things I ſay,</hi> I borrow a teſtimony from <hi>John,</hi> for your cauſe, that <hi>ye might be ſaved.</hi> 4. The nature of Chriſts Miniſtry tends to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners, how croſſe-like ſoever it ſeeme to work, to ſuch an end; And in his Miniſtry, he intends the ſalvation of his own, whom his love doth follow when they are among the croud of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; for, <hi>theſe things I ſay,</hi> not onely in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this teſtimony, but even in the harſheſt of this Apology, that <hi>ye might be ſaved,</hi> not that he intended the ſalvation of all theſe, but that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his work tended to that end, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſalvation of his own among them, 5. Albeit the ſalvation of men be their great and eternal happineſſe, yet they are ready to lay manie obſtructions in the way thereof, which it is Chriſts great love and condeſcendence to paſſe over; for, ſo much alſo is imported, in <hi>his ſaying theſe things, that they might be ſaved;</hi> They obſtructed the way of their own ſalvation, and Chriſt condeſcended to take the ſtumbling blocks out of the way.</p>

It is alſo the duty of a faithful Miniſter, not only by clearneſſe of doctrine to ſhine round about him, but alſo to have his light ſeaſoned with much zeale and love; that ſo it may affect his own heart, and burne up his own corruptions; may warme and ſtir up others; may make him move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as fire doth) in his motions; and may make him active and vigorous in his calling, though with the waſting of himſelfe; for, <hi>he was a burning and ſhining light.</hi> 5. Qualifications and gifts are not beſtowed upon all Miniſters in a like meaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but Chriſt diſpenſeth them variouſly; that he may ſhew forth his abſolute freedome in beſtowing; and that the glory of ſucceſſe may not be aſcribed to mens gifts, when he ſhall effectuate great things by weakeſt inſtruments; And he doth beſtow gifts on men according to their employments, in ſeverall times or places; for, this commendation of <hi>John</hi> imports, that he was gifted above others, even honeſt inſtruments, being more then a Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.9, 10, 11.

They are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as well as others, to the common condition of mortality, and oft times they ſpend themſelves ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with burning and ſhining to others; yea, and are haſtened out of the world by perſecution: Beſide, the Lord by removing of them, doth put an end to their toile, and call them to enjoy the fruit of their labours; doth chaſtiſe the ingratitude of the world, and exerciſe his own in it; and, doth make way for ſetting forth the riches of his glory, in raiſing up, and creating new ſtars in their place; for, here it is ſaid of <hi>John, he was a burning and ſhining light,</hi> but now is put out, and gone. 7. When Chriſts faithful ſervants are dead and gone, yet their commendation liveth in his eſtimation; Therefore doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>John,</hi> when now he is gone by death, or at leaſt, is in priſon. 8. A ſound and powerful, a cleare and lively Miniſtry, may have ſtrange effects, even among unrenewed people; The excellency of their doctrine, when it ſhines among a people who have long lien under the darkneſſe of ignorance, and ſuperſtitious traditions; the countenance of Miniſters from great men, (as <hi>John</hi> had from <hi>Herod;</hi>) the excellency of their gifts, together with a common work of the ſpirit upon hearers, may produce ſtrange effects in them who have no true grace nor faith, for, ſaith he, <hi>ye were willing to rejoyce in his light;</hi> there was none but <hi>John</hi> in their account, and they were much taken up with him. 9. Mens affections may be much aloft, and they may have great fits of joy and delight, through the novelty and excellency of doctrine, and through ſome apprehenſion of that at a diſtance, which the Word ſpeaks of, who yet have no ſound grace, as never having been humbled for ſinne, nor laid hold on Chriſt, on whom alone, ſound joy is founded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. for, theſe temporaries <hi>were willing to rejoyce,</hi> or, delighted to rejoyce. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Heb</hi> 6.4, 5. 10. It is alſo an evidence of mens unſoundneſſe, when they are more taken with men, and with their gifts, as their own, then they are affected with God as the Authour of theſe gifts, or do finde his power accompanying the exerciſe of them, in effects upon their hearts; for, they rejoyced <hi>in his light,</hi> or, in that light as his, not ſeeing, nor feeling God in it. 11. Temporary motions, wrought in men by a lively Miniſtry, are not to be leaned to by themſelves, nor are Miniſters to look much to the reſpect that comes from ſuch, for it will be but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany. Their unſoundneſſe will not beare out, and when Miniſters meet with diſcountenance from great men, and with the croſſe, and do touch their darling ſinnes, they will give over; for, they <hi>were willing to rejoyce,</hi> but, <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> or, <hi>an hour,</hi> and particularly, they rejected him, when <hi>Herod</hi> turned his enemy, and when he did teſtifie concerning Chriſt, whom they liked not. 12. Mens temporary ſits will be a witneſſe againſt them, after they have made apoſtacy; and their reſpect to a Miniſter, will witneſſe againſt their not receiving his meſſage; for, their former carriage is now a check to them for their Apoſtacy; and they are declared to be perverſe, who, when they could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no pretence reprove <hi>John,</hi> but muſt admire him, yet they would not credit his Teſtimony of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular teſtimony, produced by Chriſt, whereby alſo the Father witneſſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, is, that of his works, in doing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the work of redemption, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to be a greater witneſſe then that of <hi>John,</hi> and that they prove abundantly that he is ſent of the Father, as the Meſſiah and Saviour of the world. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit our hearts be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally jealous and ſuſpitious of divine truth, and of what Chriſt ſaith of himſelf; yet he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of witneſſes, for curing of this diſeaſe, and putting us beyond all cauſe of ſuſpition; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>John,</hi> he hath more and <hi>greater</hi> witneſſes, that in their mouths every word may be eſtabliſhed, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.1. 2. Chriſt is willing and ready to give proof of his excellency, not onely by his own or others words, but by his working really to prove it to their ſenſe and ſatisfaction; for he hath a witneſſe of his <hi>works.</hi> 3. Chriſts workings are not dumb works, but are ſpeaking teſtimonies of his glorie; and we never take them up rightly, till we ſee that in them; for, <hi>his works do beare witneſſe that the Father hath ſent him,</hi> as his own Sonne, to be the ſaviour of the world, and that he is not contrary to the Father in his working, as they alleadged, 4. Albeit the teſtimony of the meaneſt inſtrument, concerning Chriſt, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48148:46"/>
to the Word, is as true as any other witneſſe; yet if we reſpect degrees of convincing evidence, the teſtimony of Chriſts own works, is a clearer confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Godhead, office, and doctrine, then the beſt of mens teſtimonies, For, not only is this teſtimony more intrinſccall, then the commendation of another, but his doing theſe things that were fore-propheſied of the Meſſiah, is an undeniable proofe, and therefore he remits <hi>John</hi> to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.3, 4, 5. and his doing of them in his own name, proveth that he did them of himſelfe from the <hi>Father;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, that his <hi>works are a greater witneſſe then that of John,</hi> proving <hi>that the Father hath ſent him;</hi> For he could not have done what he did, not only by way of confirmation of the doctrine of the Scriptures, (which ſeducers by their miracles do not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5.) but ſo agreeable to predictions of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah, if he had not been God, and ſent of the Father, and if he had called himſelf what he was not. And albeit Prophets and Apoſtles wrought great miracles, who were not the Meſſiah; Yet this infringeth not the clearneſſe of this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for, theſe miracles did only confirme their calling, authority and doctrine, and that they were what they called themſelves, (which was not that they were the Meſſiah) and ſo do Chriſts miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his doctrine, and what he ſaid of himſelfe: Next, they were but inſtruments, and that not of the miracle, but of the Word and ſigne by which it was done, and they expreſſely declared that it was not in their own name or power any ſuch thing was done, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.12, 16, But Chriſt was principal agent, and wrought them in his own name, and in this reſpect, he <hi>did the works, which none other man did,</hi> Joh. 15.24 5. All the works that Chriſt did, were entruſted him from the Father, not only to undertake, but to finiſh and perfect them: As God, the Father did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his nature and operation with him, and as Mediatour, he had a commiſſion by the common counſell of the bleſſed Trinity; for, they were <hi>the works, which the Father gave him to finiſh.</hi> 6. Chriſt is faithful in his truſt, and what is committed to him he doth; for, ſaith he, <hi>the works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, are the ſame works that I do.</hi> 7. As Chriſts works do prove his excellency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo alſo do they commend him to his people, as being ſent out of the Fathers love for their good, an alſufficient and omnipotent Mediatour, able to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate all his purpoſes, and worthy to be reſted on by them; for, ſaith he, they <hi>beare witneſſe of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi>

                     </gap>ve, was the ſigne of the ſpirits coming on him; and therefore this teſtimony was the more to be regarded. But the following <hi>verſe,</hi> and Chriſts way of ſubjoyning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs to his teſtimonies, leads us rather to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, as a reproof of their ignorance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom they glorified ſo much; For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were much puffed up, and might readily oppoſe this unto that immediate teſtimony given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, that they were the people, whoſe fathers had heard the voice of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18, 19, 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. and with whoſe Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> God had ſpoken familiarly, and given him a very neare manifeſtation of himſelf, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.8. (not in a bodily way, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. but ſpiritual and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual of his back-parts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.) Chriſt ſheweth them, that all this was nothing to them, they neither had, nor looked like any ſuch mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations, but were deaf and blinde to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 37. And whereas they might object, that though ſuch manifeſtations were gone, yet they had the Word, which was delivered by the Miniſtry of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to their fathers, and in them, to their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and children: Chriſt anſwers, that it had not its due place with them, ſince they beleeved not in him, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. God is ſo faithful to them whom he employes in his work, that they ſhall not want his teſtimony and approbation; to beare them out againſt all oppoſition and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men; Of this, his carriage toward his Sonne, is a ſpecial inſtance, and a pledge to his own, of what they may expect in their own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: <hi>the Father which hath ſent me, hath borne witneſſe of me.</hi> 2. The Fathers immediate teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſt, is eſpecially to be taken notice of, as being a witneſſe above all doubt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9, 10. and ſhewing that Chriſt is famous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in heaven, whatever eſteeme men have of him on earth; Therefore, that <hi>the Father himſelf, hath borne witneſſe of him,</hi> is ſuperadded as greater then the teſtimony of his works, which yet was a greater witneſſe then that of <hi>John, verſe</hi> 36. And indeed, the preſence of the glorious Trinity made that witneſſe moſt ſolemne, and the opening of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhewed that, through him, heaven was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to ſinners on earth. 3. Men may be ready to delude themſelves, becauſe of great things of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48148:46"/>
God manifeſted to the Church and Nation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are, and to their progenitors, who yet themſelves come farre ſhort, and are nothing like theſe things; for, ſo did the Jewes upon what <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and their fathers had found, when yet ſaith he, <hi>ye have neither heard his voice at any time, not ſeen his ſhape,</hi> that is, not onely had they none of theſe extraordinary manifeſtations, which are not uſual in declining times, but they had not knowledge of God like to that, which may be attained; which is a clear, ſolid and ſatisfactory knowledge of God, as of one whom we know by ſeeing and hearing. This they wanted, and ſo proved that they were not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> diſciples, nor looked like that people whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors had ſeene ſo much of God 4. The Word of God is ſufficiently able to compenſe and make up the want of any extraordinary manifeſtation; for, ſo is implyed here in that which Chriſt meets with, that they had the Word from their progenitors, to make up the want of thoſe manifeſtations; Which Chriſt doth not refute, ſeeing the Word is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſure way for attaining the knowledge of God, See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. 5. It is not enough to prove men to be in a good eſtate, that they have the Word, unleſſe by faith it get acceſſe into the heart, and it be faſtened and kept there, as a treaſure, and as ſeed to bring forth fruit; And this may be wanting in them who pretend to much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of the Word; for, ſo ſaith Chriſt unto the Jewes, <hi>ye have not his Word abiding in you,</hi> it muſt be an <hi>engraffed Word,</hi> where it doth any good, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. 6. Where Chriſt is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in, and received as ſent of the Father, there the Word is not rooted, nor is there any ſaving knowledge of it: And particularly, the Jewes who did not, or yet do not receive Chriſt now exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the New Teſtament, nor are led by the Old Teſtament to him, they have not one word ſavingly of it; for, this is the reaſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chalenge, <hi>for whom he hath ſent, him ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</hi>

The way of ſalvation, and all things needful for attaining there; of, are fully revealed in Scripture, and was held forth even in the Old Teſtament, much more now both in Old and New; for, ſaith he, <hi>in them ye think ye have eternal life,</hi> which was a true thought; as to the Scriptures pointing out of the way, though they might be deluded in their application as to themſelves, or thinking to be ſaved by the having or reading of it. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. 3. Albeit the Scriptures be plaine and clear in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and the entrance thereof give light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. Yet they are a depth not ſoone comprehended, or by ſuperficial ſearch, but are a treaſure in a Mine, to be found out, by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and painful pondering of every word and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, (none whereof are expreſſed in vaine, or at randome, but all divine) by conſidering of the ſcope and dependance, and comparing Scripture with Scripture, and humble and ſingle dependance upon God; for, he recommends the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>ſearched.</hi> 4. This treaſure will be found out by the painful ſearcher, and it is the common duty of all the viſible Church to read and ſearch into the Scriptures, that they may finde it; Therefore doth he enjoyne this <hi>ſearch,</hi> as a thing poſſible, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth it to the Jewes in common, who were his hearers at this time, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. 5.

1. That which God offers in Chriſt to loſt ſinners, is that which onely deſerveth the name of life, in grace here, and glory hereafter, as being the true remedy of our ſpiritual death, and without which our life on earth is ſcarce worthy the name; Therefore it is called <hi>life.</hi> 2. Men may be ſo farre deluded, as to conceit they will get life, when yet they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanes of life; for, theſe <hi>Jewes thought to have eternal life,</hi> verſe 39. and yet they take not the right way to it. 3. The life of loſt ſinners is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in Chriſt, who is the purchaſer, ſtorehouſe, keeper and diſpenſer thereof, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of the Covenant, and the mid-man betwixt God and ſinners; for, ſo is here held out, they muſt <hi>come to me,</hi> ſaith he, eate they live. 4. The way how ſinners come to partake of this life, is, by their coming to Chriſt by faith: And whoever they are that have a preſſing need of Chriſt, and whatever diſcouragements they finde, cannot bide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, and who, whatever diſtance they are at, yet are moving toward him, though with a ſlow progreſſe, and are ſtill ſeeking more enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whatever they have; Theſe are true beleevers, and will not miſſe of life, but their ſoul ſhall be kept in life, till they come to live with him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for the condition required, is, to <hi>come to Chriſt,</hi> which is in effect to beleeve, as is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.33 and upon this it is imported that they ſhall <hi>have life.</hi> 5. Albeit life be to be found onely in Chriſt, yet few make uſe of him for that end, but moſt part being ignorant of themſelves, and of him, conceiting of their own welbeing, or to get life ſome other way; being taken up with earthly things; given up to judicial obduration: or not pleaſing the tearmes of getting life by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own righteouſneſſe and pleaſures; Moſt part, I ſay, being thus prejudged, do neglect this offered ſalvation: for, ſo is chalenged, <hi>yee will not come to me.</hi> 6. The great obſtruction of faith, and aggravation of unbelief, is mens wilfulneſſe in not coming to Chriſt; Some will not come and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, out of their malice and obſtinacie, as many of theſe Jewes would not come to him, though he proved never ſo clearly what he was. Others are plagued with brutiſh ſenſuality; And they who think they would come, but apprehend reaſons why they dare not, will finde that, <hi>will not,</hi> is the great impediment, and that they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe they are not willing to be ſtript of themſelves, as faith in Chriſt requireth they ſhould be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Otherwiſe there is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lieth in the comers way, but love removeth it; he will welcome them who have refuſed many invitations, have wandred farre, fallen into groſſe ſinnes, played the harlot with many lovers, &amp;c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they will come to him, to ſeek grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for, and amend them; Yea, the dead may come to him to get life, if they reſolve not that they will not; and they who have ſome weake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, may come to him to get willingneſſe; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the chalenge is, <hi>ye will not come,</hi> which in many of them was obſtinacie upon grounds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and brutiſh ſtupidity, and moſt part of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers are guilty of it in ſome degree, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds. See <hi>Pſalme</hi> 81.11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. 7. Chriſt will chalenge mens not embracing his offer and invitation, to come and get life, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when there is much of will in it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his offer is a great indignity, and will condemne men; his peoples unbelief is a ſin, to be avoided at his command, under paine of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; his love will make a quarrel of it, that we ſhould be ſtraitned in our own bowels, when there are bowels of affection in him to be let forth; and, he is really offended at that pride (though masked with a ſhew of humility) which makes that the ſelf-condemned ſinner will not embrace him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Goſpel termes; for, it is a chalenge here, <hi>ye will not come, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is our great advantage to be mourning for the unbelief we finde in us, and when our unbelief is our burden.</p>

                  <p>Leſt they ſhould think that in commending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and chalenging them, he was hunting after vain-glory, as falſe-teachers do, Chriſt obviates that miſtake, and ſheweth that he was ſeeking no ſuch thing, nor was capable of any addition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the creature. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is ſo omniſcient, that he knoweth and marketh the thoughts of every one that he dealeth with; So much doth his obviating their thoughts teach. 2. It is the uſual fault of men, that they have but low and baſe thoughts of Chriſt, and that they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and judge of him and his followers, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for, this ſuſpition of Chriſt, imported that they looked on him as a meer man, and, as they were themſelves ambitious, <hi>verſe</hi> 44. ſo did they judge of him, and ſo are his ſervants judged of. 3. Chriſt was no hunter after vain-glory, nor is he capable of any addition of honour by mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of him; nor ought men to think that he ſeeks them becauſe he hath any need of them, or that they adde any thing to him, when he makes them ſomewhat; For albeit men are bound to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and declare his ſuper excellent glory; and men by ſinne do what they can to diſhonour him, as who would caſt dirt or ſpit againſt the Sun? yet his infintie glory is neither capable of addition nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution from the creature; for, <hi>I receive not honour from men.</hi>

And albeit he was ſingular in his adminiſtration of his office, and all tending to the good of ſinners: Yet ſuch is the perverſeneſſe of the world, as not to make him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; for, it is the peculiar priviledge of the elect, to be drawn to him, and others, they neither ſee his excellency, nor feele their need of him; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not.</hi> 4. Such as reject Chriſt and receive him not, are deſtitute of the love of God, nor have they any evidence of reſpect to him, ſince Chriſt is the cleareſt image of the Father, and cometh in his name, and the Father will not be acknowledged but in and through him; Therefore, by this doth he prove that chalenge, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. 5. When Chriſt manifeſts himſelfe to the world, it is uſual with Satan to hound out ſeducers and falſe teachers, to ſtudy to beare him down, to ſeduce ſouls, and by their courſes, to make the way of truth odious; for, ſo is imported that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall come, pretending either to be the Chriſt, or to hold him out to others, See <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.5, 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.36, 37. 6. Albeit falſe-teachers pretend to come in God and Chriſts name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.5. Yet they do but come in their own name, as having no commiſſion when they runne, as making themſelves, their reputation and advantage, their chiefe aime in their undertaking, and as ſpeaking the imaginations of their own heart and brain, without any warrant from God; for, <hi>another ſhall come in his own name.</hi> 7. Such as love not God, nor embrace Chriſt or his ſent ſervants, may take worſe in their roome, and will eaſily receive and embrace falſe-teachers and ſeducers. Mens nature is propenſe to evil courſes, and is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be affected with what is wrong; And ſeducers are more ready to ſerve mens humours, then faithful Miniſters may be; and withall; it is Gods juſt judgement on the world, to give them up to ſuch, ſince they will not receive the love of the truth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi> This is the hainous ſinne of men, to affront Chriſt, to reſpect Satan in his meſſengers, before God in his Sonne, as to preferre lies to truth: And it is their dreadful puniſhment, to be given up to ſuch deluſions, becauſe they will not ſee the light, or do receive it only as it may ſerve their turne, or weary of the light, and walk not anſwerable to it.

                  <p>The fourth chalenge, (and the chiefe cauſe of their unbelief, and not embracing Chriſt) is for their pride and vaine glory, which they hunted after among men, not contenting themſelves to be approven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of God, by embracing his Sonne by faith. See <hi>chap.</hi> 12.43. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. True beleevers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of Chriſt are all one: They do indeed beleeve
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48148:48"/>
in Chriſt; who, out of affection and ſenſe of need, do cloſe with, and embrace Chriſt offering himſelfe in the Goſpel, albeit they have not attained to lively aſſurance; and without this, hiſtorical aſſent will not prove ſaving faith; Therefore, <hi>receiving,</hi> ver. 43. and <hi>beleeving</hi> in this <hi>verſe</hi> do mutually explain one another. So alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 2. Albeit faith be the gift of God, and it be impoſſible for any natural man to beleeve of himſelfe; Yet men by continuance in ſinfull wayes, and entertaining particular reigning ſinnes, may adde to this impotency, may lay more impediments in the way of Gods working faith, and may be convinced that their caſe is inconſiſtent with true faith; for, <hi>how can ye beleeve?</hi> ſaith he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that they had ſuperadded impediments of beleeving to their condition by nature, as a crooked twig by growing, becometh more difficult to be made ſtreight, and that themſelves might ſee that their temper was inconſiſtent with faith. 3. As faith, which ſuppoſeth a man regenerate and ſubdued to Chriſt and his yoke, and which purifieth the heart, is inconſiſtent with the dominion of any one luſt or corrupt affection; So in particular, it cannot conſiſt with the dominion of ambition, and affectation of vaine-glory; for, albeit we be bound to honour all men, and Magiſtrates in particular, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. and are bound in honour to preferre one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. and albeit beleevers ought ſo to carry themſelves, as the way of God may be honoured in, and becauſe of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. Yea, albeit they cannot hinder, nor is it their ſinne, if undue honour be offered unto them, provided they mourn for it, and receive it not: Yet when men hunt after reſpect from men, and do receive it with luſtful delight, and reſt on it as the chief ſcope of their actions, it is an evidence of no faith, or that what they pretend to, is unſound: Therefore, albeit ſome ſuch be ſaid to beleeve, where it prevailed but in part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. yet where it beares full ſway, and it only is ſought after, he ſaith, <hi>how can ye beleeve, which receive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another?</hi> And indeed, ſuch do evidence, that they have not cloſed with Chriſt on his own tearmes, of ſelfe denial and being convinced of their worthleſneſſe; that they will take moſt paines on their outſide to be ſeen of men, and ſo cannot but neglect ſincerity; and, that their ambition and love of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from men, will draw them to apoſtacy and prove their unſoundneſſe, when they are called to undergo an ignominious croſſe. 4. God alloweth and conferreth much honour upon true beleevers; They have an honour of ſtate and priviledges, in being ſonnes and friends to God; They have the honour of his approbation in their conſcience, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his reſpects to them are made conſpicuous to the world; And, they are allowed to wait for the honour of eternal exaltation; for, there is <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that cometh from God,</hi> to ſuch. 5. As this true honour comes from God alone, whoſe approbation only may be reſted on, and who can advance thoſe whom he approveth, and make them honourable. So ſincere beleevers muſt ſeek after this which is ſo neceſſary; by ſtudying humble ſincerity in his ſight, following thoſe duties that are in leaſt reſpect in the world, and not reſting on ſo much only, as may gain them honour from men; And as they muſt ſeek after it, not contenting themſelves with leſſe, ſo they muſt be content with this, and be looſed from the love of honour from men, not regarding how they be looked on by the world becauſe they embrace Chriſt; Therefore, it is imported, they ſhould <hi>ſeek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that cometh from God only,</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. 6. Whatever may be mens duty, in ſeeking to approve themſelves even to the conſciences of men, and not to neglect juſt diſreſpect in the world, under pretext of approving themſelves to God; Yet ſuch as ambitiouſly hunt after vain-glory, and reſpect from men, do prove themſelves to be careleſſe of Gods approbation, ſince hunting after the one, and ſeeking the other, cannot conſiſt together; for, here they are oppoſed, <hi>ye receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only.</hi>

                  <p>In this firſt <hi>ver.</hi> we have a general connexion, and tranſition from what had been formerly ſaid, to what now followeth, with a general deſignation of the time and place of this miracle. As for the time of it, it is ſaid to be <hi>after theſe things,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if this followed immediately upon what is ſpoken of, <hi>chap</hi> 5. for then Chriſt was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> now he is in <hi>Galilee:</hi> But <hi>John</hi> doth paſſe over many things that are marked by the other Evangeliſts, and doth only pitch upon the hiſtory of theſe miracles, though marked by others, becauſe they gave occaſion to the following Sermon which the reſt had omitted. And in particular, the other Evangeliſts do cleare that this followed upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.10, 11, 12, 13, &amp;c. which tryſted alſo with his diſciples return, after he had ſent them out to preach, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.29, 30, 31, 32, &amp;c. and with <hi>Herods</hi> hearing of his fame, and deſiring to ſee him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.7.—10, &amp;c. As for the place it is ſaid <hi>he went over the Sea of Galilee,</hi> &amp;c. This lake in <hi>Galilee,</hi> through which <hi>Jordan</hi> runs, gets ſeveral names in Scripture from ſeveral places upon the banks of it, as here it is called <hi>the Sea of</hi> Tiberias, from a Town built there by <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> and named from <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. We need not conceive that Chriſt went over the lake to the oppoſite ſhoare, for <hi>Tiberias</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> (to the bounds whereof he went, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.10) were both on one ſide of that lake, and the people followed him on foot, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.33. But he paſſed over ſome creek or bay of that lake, that ſo he might more ſpeedily retire himſelfe into a deſert place, as the reſt call it, and might eaſe his wearied diſciples, who had been toiled with travel, and be rid of the preſſe of the multitude, at leaſt for a time. From theſe words, as they are cleared, we may <hi>learn.</hi> 1. Chriſts practice and lot teacheth, that his ſervants ought to be very buſſie in their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and may expect, and ſhould ſubmit unto a toſſed unſetled life; for, he is whiles in <hi>Judea,</hi> and whiles in <hi>Galilee,</hi> about his calling, and is here driven to new wandring. 2. Chriſts and his ſervants enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the world, is ordinarily ſuch, as moſt deſart and barren places will be more ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, then any other; Therefore, Chriſt leaveth the Cities, and retires to a deſart, ſhunning <hi>Herods</hi> fury. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37, 38. 3. As it is no right way to keep Chriſt among a people, to wrong his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; (for, he removes when <hi>John</hi> is ſlain) So it is lawful for Miniſters to withdraw themſelves from the dangers wherewith they are threatned, providing the trial be perſonal, and they may do it without wronging their cauſe and calling; for, ſo hath Chriſt taught us, <hi>who went over the Sea of Galilee,</hi> &amp;c. to ſhun the rage of <hi>Herod,</hi> who being engaged in perſecution would be at more of it. 4. As Chriſts ſervants may have much toile, and ſhould ſpend themſelves willingly in his work; So he will be tollicitous for them who ſerve him, and careful to give them needful refreſhments and breathings; for, ſuch is his care of his diſciples here, who return wearied unto him.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This verſe contains a remote occaſion of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and a conſequent of Chriſts removal; which is, that many did follow him, conſidering the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he had done; And their following him till they were hungry, occaſioned the miracle in feeding of them. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Perſecution and trouble will not make Chriſt have a thin back, when he ſees it meet to honour himſelfe by having many followers; for, here <hi>a great multitude followed him,</hi> though <hi>Herod</hi> be ſeeking him, and he go but to a deſert place, where they could be but ill accommodate. And this ſpeaks ſadly againſt the lazineſſe of many in times of greater quiet. 2. Such as have an errand to Chriſt, or any eſtimation of him, will be at pains to follow him, for, ſo did they here, yea and <hi>outwent them,</hi> Mark. 6.33. though they were not, at leaſt all of them, well principled. 3. It is not enough that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes pretend great reſpect to Chriſt, and follow him for outward conſiderations and advantages, unleſſe their principals and their motives be yet more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; for, herein they fell ſhort, in that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, <hi>becauſe they ſaw his miracles,</hi> not taking up the true excellency of his perſon thereby, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with his doctrine, or ſeeking their own ſpiritual good; But the great wheele in all this, was their being affected with his works as a novelty, and the outward benefit they had thereby. And therefore however now they follow him on all hazards, yet afterward when he lets them ſee their errour, and preſſeth ſpiritual things upon them, they voluntarily forſake him, <hi>ver.</hi> 66. It is better to feel one miracle wrought upon the heart in changing of it, then to be affected with many outward miracles. 4. Chriſt doth perfectly know and take notice who they are that do follow him, and what their principles and motives are; for, here an account of it is given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtrate; and afterward he lets them know it more clearly. 5. Chriſt makes himſelfe known by theſe

miracles <hi>on the diſeaſed,</hi> not onely to fulfil the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies that went before of him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6. But to ſhew that he came by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to do good, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. and not to ſatisfie curioſity; And to teach, that his company and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations are very alluring, to invite men to come to him: for, they will finde many diſeaſes and wants among his followers, and him taking notice of them all, and curing them, even miraculouſly.</p>

                  <p>Followeth another antecedent of the miracle, ſhewing that however the people do follow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him, yet he went up for a while into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired mountain with his diſciples, to refreſh them with his company. This mountain was not the place where the miracle was wrought, but after he had reſted a while here, he came down to the plain to the multitude, as may be gathered from <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Refreſhment after la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travel in Gods ſervice, is ſo neceſſary and ſo lawful, that Chriſt will have a care to afford it to his ſervants, even in greateſt throng of buſines; Therefore, albeit the people do follow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, yet he <hi>went up into a mountain,</hi> for this end. 2. It is the ſweet refreſhment of Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, when they have not onely vacation, for a time, from their laborious toile, but when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſome familiar hours of fellowſhip with himſelf, being free from the noiſe of diſtractions in the world; for, thus were they refreſhed, <hi>there he ſate with his diſciples,</hi> where no doubt he refreſhed their bodies with reſt and food, as may be gathered from <hi>Mark</hi> 6.31. but chiefly their ſouls with divine conferences. 3. Chriſt is the wiſe diſpenſer of his ſervants refreſhments and breathing times, who doth let out their allowances as they may be moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and not prejudicial unto them; for he doth not bring them after their toile, to a place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, but to a deſert and a <hi>mountain</hi> to reſt them in, and allowes it but for <hi>a while,</hi> or, <hi>a little,</hi> as it is, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.31. and preſently they are at work again: If Chriſt did not deale thus, they would finde reſt and exceſſe of delights waſte them more, then toile it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> the circumſtance of the time of this miracle, which was but generally ſpoken of, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. is now more expreſſely declared, that it was about the time of the Paſſeover. And ſo if that Feaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1. were the Paſſeover, this ſhould be the third ſince his Baptiſme, for the firſt is ſpoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 2.13. This circumſtance is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not onely to confirme the truth of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or, to put us in minde that theſe anniverſary feaſts were peculiar to the Jewes; or, to ſhew how ſeaſonably Chriſt did preach of eating the ſpiritual food of their ſouls, about that time the Paſſeover was to be eaten. But further, it would appeare that Chriſt went not up to this Feaſt, for it is here marked, that a little before that time, he is in the deſart places of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and nothing is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his going up afterward to it, by the reſt of the Evangeliſts. And <hi>John</hi> 7.1. ſeemes to point out his continued reſolution, after this Sermon, to ſtay in <hi>Galilee;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 7.3, 4. his brethren do cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him for lurking, and <hi>John</hi> 7.21. he ſeemes to point at that work at the poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> of which <hi>chap.</hi> 5. as the work which he had laſt done among them, and which ſtuck much in their minds at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> As for the multitude that followed him, it is not needful to enquire whether they went up after this to the Feaſt, or not; But for his part, it teacheth, 1. Corrupt Church men are as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and as much to be avoided, as any perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: for, as he withdrew for a time from <hi>Herod,</hi> though he went afterward to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> verſe 59. belike, becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> was gone to the Feaſt, as he uſed ſometime to do, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.7. or, becauſe he would not alway lurk) ſo he kept himſelf without the reach of the Scribes and Phariſees. 2. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee Chriſt and his ſervants ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the publike and ſolemne meetings of the Church, becauſe of dangers and ſnares laid for them: And in ſuch a caſe, it is their affliction, not their ſinne, to ſtay away; for ſo much doth Chriſts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and lot teach. Though it be remarkable how prudently he carrieth it, that he will not give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by ſtaying in the Cities at ſuch a time, but retireth himſelf till the importunity of the people bring him back again. 3. Chriſt would have his people expecting preſervation, in the uſe of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary lawful means; and for this end, he who could by his omnipotencie reſtrain the fury of men, doth ſanctifie that way in his own practice, which his people are to walk in; for, he doth ſtay away, though he could have gone there, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf even when he was among their hands.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48148:50"/>
wrought. In theſe <hi>verſes</hi> is recorded, that Chriſt taking notice of the multitude, doth poſe <hi>Philip,</hi> how they might be provided, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. which he doth, not out of ignorance or irreſolution, but to try him, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Philip</hi> gives ſuch an anſwer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes his weakneſſe in the matter, by ſhewing that much money (and poſſibly more then they could command) would not by a mouthful, farre leſſe full refreſhment, to every one of ſuch a multitude, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. We are to conſider, that this was not the firſt thing Chriſt did with them; But after he had pitied the multitude, and preached unto them, and healed their ſick, and after he had refuſed to ſend them away in the evening, faſting, at the diſciples deſire (all which are recorded by the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts:) he at laſt falls upon this, and other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions recorded by the reſt, for the further trial and diſcovery of the diſciples.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is no trouble nor diſtraction, nor deſire of eaſe, will hinder Chriſt from taking notice of them who come to him, even albeit they have many defects in their coming; Therefore, albeit Chriſt had withdrawn to refreſh himſelf and his diſciples, and it was much indiſcretion in them to interrupt him, yet he takes notice of them, and pitying them, doth preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and cure their ſick, as is recorded by the reſt. And this may teach Chriſts ſervants not to take it in evil part, though they be kept ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in their calling, as to want ſometime that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt that is allowed upon them. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28, 2. As an ardent affection after Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, will make men oft-times forget their owne outward neceſſities, ſo they may enjoy him, (as here, we find the multitude follow him to a deſart place, without any proviſion;) So Chriſt will not faile to take notice of all the neceſſities, even bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, of thoſe that follow him; for, here he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of what they had neglected. 3. Chriſt will put his followers, who have been long in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and have ſeene much of him, to give a proof of their proficiencie thereby, before he let them ſee new proofs of his power; for ſuch was his ſcope in this queſtion, <hi>Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat?</hi> He would firſt try what was in the thoughts of his diſciples, who heretofore had ſeene many of his miracles. And the queſtion ſeemes to be put to <hi>Philip,</hi> not ſo much becauſe he had been the mouth of the diſciples, in deſiring Chriſt to ſend the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude away: as becauſe now he was an old ſcholar, and among the firſt of his followers, <hi>John</hi> 1.43. (as <hi>Andrew</hi> alſo was, <hi>John</hi> 1.40.) and yet long after this, he is but rude and ignorant, <hi>John</hi> 14.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts words (as alſo his diſpenſations) wil very readily be miſtaken and miſconſtructed, unleſſe himſelfe explaine what is his ſcope in them; Therefore it is neceſſary that he clear it here. 2. Chriſts ſcope in his words, (as alſo in his dealing,) is oft-times onely to try them with whom he hath to do: and when he hath ſo done, he can let them finde that his trying word or diſpenſation is not all; but he hath more to ſay and do; for, <hi>this he ſaid, to prove him,</hi> and yet after that, he did the work. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15.16. 3. Chriſt will even have the weakneſſe of his own followers tried; partly, that what is known to him, and yet lurking, may be diſcovered to them, and ſo they may not conceit of more then they have, and the evil which before lurked and was unſeen, may be cured when it is diſcovered; And partly, that he may be exalted, who is alſufficient to do what he pleaſeth, when their weakneſſe lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by: for theſe cauſes did he <hi>prove Philip,</hi> and belike the reſt alſo, as appears afterward in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</hi> 4. Chriſt needs not conſult with any, nor the help of any mans wit in greateſt extremities; nor is he ignorant, or uncertain and irreſolute what to do, whatever his way of carrying on his work ſeeme to ſay; Therefore it is added for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>for he himſelf knew what he would do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When Chriſt puts even his moſt eminent followers to trial, they will prove weak, if they be left to themſelves; for, ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears here in one and moe of them, though they had ſeene many proofs of him 2. When men judge by ſenſe or reaſon, and do look to likelihoods and probabilities, and not to Chriſts power, they will ſoone be at their wits end in extremities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to anſwer doubtful caſes; for, ſo much doth his anſwer teach, <hi>Two hundred penny worth of bread is not ſufficient for them that every one of them may take a little.</hi> It is not needful to determine how much this ſumme was according to our coin, but it is ſufficient to know that it was a great ſumme to them, and would have bought more then he made uſe of to feed the people with. 3. It is Chriſts way, oft-times, to do that for his people, whereof there is no probability or likelihood, that ſo his glory may ſhine the more brightly in it; for, ſo it appears in his working this miracle, and feeding the multitude, when there was no appearance how it ſhould be done. And this ſhould warne men, as not to tempt God in an ordinary calling, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ordinary means; ſo alſo, not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with improbabilities, when they are in need, and have to do with Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Followeth a further preparation to the miracle, in <hi>Andrews</hi> giving an account of their proviſion, though with as little faith and expectation of what Chriſt was to do, as <hi>Philip</hi> had ſhewed. It ſeemes that after Chriſt had bid them try what they had, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.38, <hi>Andrew</hi> gave him an account that a little boy had ſo many loaves and fiſhes, (which belike were carried about for the diſciples uſe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48148:50"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 9 13.) but all that was nothing for feeding ſo many. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Weakneſſe and ſhort-ſightedneſſe is not the temper of one onely, but of all Chriſts followers, if they be put to it; and every diſciple will be ready to diſcover his own weakneſſe, faſter then anothers, in a day of trial; for, <hi>Andrew</hi> acquits himſelf no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Philip</hi> here, though he was one of the firſt diſciples. 2. As Chriſt did not neglect to provide ſuch outward things, as were neceſſary for himſelf and his followers; So his proviſion is ſuch as may teach ſobriety, and contentment with a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unto all, for, he hath onely <hi>five barley loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes.</hi> 3. Such as would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, ought to be tender, and ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the neceſſities of others, were their own portion never ſo ſmall; for, not onely Chriſt, but his diſciples are willing to beſtow their ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion upon the multitude, though they judge it could ſerve them in no ſtead. 4. It is worthy of ſerious and frequent obſervation, to conſider how weak ſenſe and reaſon will prove in Gods matters; how much Chriſt will lay by the hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of creatures, before he appear in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous working; and, how he will work that for a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy people, that is little expected by any; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo is <hi>Andrew's</hi> weakneſſe marked, <hi>(What are they among ſo many?)</hi> as well as <hi>Philips,</hi> that it might contribute to ſet out Chriſts glory in this miracle.</p>

                  <p>Followeth a nearer preparation to the miracle, wherein, Chriſt having laid by the expectation of his diſciples, commands that they bid the people ſit down upon the graſſe, which was rank in that Countrey and climate at that ſeaſon; whereunto the people (who were a great many) give obedience, and ſo Chriſt proceeds to feed them. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt takes no advantage of his peoples weakneſſe and dulneſſe, to hinder him to do good when it is needed; for, notwithſtanding their ſlowneſſe of heart to give him glory, yet he goeth to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, for their good, and the peoples. 2. It is Chriſts way, oft-times, to refute the doubts of his people, by his working, and by real proofs of his power and love; for, he ſtayeth not to debate with his diſciples about their doubts, but refutes them by the following work. 3. Chriſt may ſee it fit to engage his own in ſtrange-like ſervice, and to impoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon them that ſeeme abſurd to ſenſe and reaſon, and yet give a good account of all, in his time: for, ſuch was this command, to <hi>make the men ſit down upon the graſſe,</hi> to a bare table, and yet he fed them all. 4.

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have the miracle it ſelf, and the manner of it; that Chriſt having given thanks, did diſtribute to the diſciples, and they to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that it grew among all their hands, ſo that every one got as much as they would. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts undertaking to do great things for his people, will not prove evaniſhing flouriſhes, but real works; for; he who bid them do ſeveral things in order to this work, doth now work it gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. This <hi>thankſgiving</hi> and <hi>bleſſing,</hi> premitted to the miracle, teacheth 1. That all our refreſhments ſhould be ſanctified and gone about with prayer and praiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.10. Conſidering, that they are great mercies, though ordinary; that it is his word and bleſſing which maketh them feed us; that this is a mean to draw down a bleſſing upon them, as Chriſt here doth on the loaves and fiſhes; that hereby they are ſanctified to us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. and, that it is a mean to ſweeten common mercies to us, when we acknowledge them to come down from heaven, as proofs of love, and do ſo take them out of his hand. 2. That chearfulneſſe and thankfulneſſe to God is to be made conſcience of by them who have ſober and courſe fare, as well as if they had choiſeſt dainties; for, ſo doth Chriſts practice teach, when he had but barley loaves and fiſhes. 3. That God alone muſt have the glory of all the wonderful works he doth for his people. Therefore doth Chriſt give thanks and bleſſe, as Mediatour, to teſtifie that it was by the power of God that he (being one with the Father) did the work. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 3. This miracle it ſelf, and the diſtribution by the diſciples to the people, and the encreaſe of the loaves, teacheth. 1. As by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſick and diſeaſed, Chriſt proved himſelf to be a Phyſician for all their plagues and ſores: ſo by this he proves himſelf to be the true ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48148:51"/>
food of ſouls, as he cleareth in the following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 2. It is not abundance, that is neceſſary for the maintenance of the life of man, but Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon what a man enjoyes, be it leſſe or more; for, ſo doth this miracle teach. 3. It is Chriſt that ſends every man his portion and allowance, through whoſe hand ſoever it comes, for though the diſciples give immediately to the people, yet it is Chriſt who, by them, doth diſtribute. 4. Chriſt allowes much benefit upon his ſervants and minds it, in his employing them betwixt him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for, he employeth them to diſtribute unto the people, not ſo much that they might get where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to refreſh themſelves, and ſatisfie their hunger, but eſpecially, that their faith might be confirmed, by being ſo near witneſſes of the glory of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. 5. Obedience to a command, and making uſe of what we have, is a mean to make it encreaſe and grow as there is need; for, in diſtributing that ſmall portion at Chriſts command, it growes. 6. Chriſts ſervants may expect to have their endeavors bleſſed, when they get their furniture out of his hand, and employ themſelves as his inſtruments, in diſpenſing thereof: for, the diſciples getting their proviſion out of Chriſts hand, and ſo diſtributing it, to feed his people, it growes among their hands. 7. Chriſts allowance is very large; he can make courſe fare of barley-bread and fiſh ſatisfie men with his bleſſing; he can make little of it ſuffice never ſo many, and let every one have no ſcant: for, they got all <hi>as much as they would.</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond effect and conſequent of this miracle, is, that hereby they are led to acknowledge him to be that great Prophet, whom the Jewes expected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prediction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. which was indeed true of him, however they did not take him up as became in his perſon, offices and benefits, beſide that they went far wrong in the following purpoſe. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. This knowledge of the Scriptures, and of the Meſſiah, which continued among theſe Jewes in theſe corrupt and declining times, may witneſſe ſadly againſt the ignorance of men in the daies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when yet light is far clearer. 2. Chriſts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould diſcover unto people ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelfe; And the uſe of his miracles is, to diſcover unto us what his offices are, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme us in the faith thereof; for, <hi>Theſe men, when they had ſeen the miracles that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is that Prophet.</hi> Though it be remarkable that this affects them more then many miracles as contributing to feed their belly, and being generally benificial to all, whereas healing of diſeaſes was but only for the good of a few; And beſide, they took occaſion to dreame of an eaſie life under this Meſſiah. 3. Chriſt ſhould be taken up and expected in the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that ſo his manifeſtations of himſelfe may be more ſweet when they come; for, this heightens their eſtimation of him, <hi>that he is the Prophet that ſhould come into the world,</hi> who had been promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>A third effect and conſequent of the miracle, is, that the people, out of blind and furious zeale, would have ſet him up to be their King, if he foreſeeing it, had not departed againe into the mountaine (where he and the diſciples had been, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) and that alone, having commanded his diſciples to go to Sea, as the other Evangeliſts do record: And ſo this is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the following miracle. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 1. There is no point of divine truth received by natural men, but their hearts are ready to detain the ſame in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and to leaven it with their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles; for, they who acknowledge him to be <hi>the Prophet,</hi> according to the Scripture, and who had warrant alſo to receive the Meſſiah as <hi>a King,</hi> do yet pervert all this, with their corrupt conceptions of his Kingdom. 2. Chriſt is ordinarily much miſtaken, even by thoſe who acknowledge him: And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, his Kingdom is oft-times conceived of amiſſe; for, ſo do they here; Though they knew him to be the promiſed Meſſiah, yet they leave that, and take themſelves only to his Kingly office, not to ſubmit themſelves to his Spiritual yoke and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but expecting carnal liberty, and a proſperous condition, under their promiſed King. And for begetting of theſe conceptions; there concurred. 1. Their miſtake and carnal conceptions of Scriptures pointing at Chriſts Kingdome, wherein they were foſtered by the corrupt gloſſes of their Teachers, who pointed out the Meſſiah as a worldly Monarch, coming to ſubdue all nations under his and their feet. 2. Their own carnal diſpoſition, which minded no other want, but that of their belly, and therefore could conceive of no other remedy and advantage by him, but that they ſhould live at eaſe, and with much liberty, under him, and he give them their meat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out toile, as he had done in the late miracle. 3. They were more ſenſible of the yoke of oppreſſion, wreathed about their necks by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of their ſlavery that way, then they were of ſinne and ſoul ſlavery, and therefore they could not take up Chriſt rightly, nor make right uſe of him, but dreamed only of deliverance from their outward ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by him. All theſe evils would be guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by them who would conceive a right of Chriſt; and in a word, men would beware dreaming of great things under the Sun, in Chriſts company, and when they engage themſelves in the waies of godlineſſe. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 3. Men may have fits of zeale, pretending more to honour Chriſt, and be more furious and violent in the expreſſions thereof, then thoſe who have ſpiritual and pure zeale; and yet all of it be but fleſhly and ſinful; for, ſuch is their blind zeale here, all they pretend to in it, is to honour Chriſt, and exalt him as a King, and they will do it violently, and <hi>by force,</hi> never minding the danger wherein they involved themſelves thereby, and yet there was nothing but fleſh in it. Carnal zeale, what ever it pretend, yet it ſailes both with winde and tide, and therefore ſuch impetuous furious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be ſuſpected. 4. Raſh and carnal blind zeale for Chriſt and his Kingdome, is one of Satans great engines, whereby he labours to bring real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Chriſt and his Kingdome; for, by this attempt of theirs, not only were all thoughts of his ſpiritual Kingdome baniſhed, and ſwallowed up in the thoughts of a carnal Monarchy, but this was the ready way to raiſe a ſcandal on him, as guilty of treaſon, and to draw the <hi>Romans</hi> on him, and them, and all his followers, to cut them off. 5. Chriſt is omniſcient, and knoweth what is rolling in every mans minde; and he will not be ſurprized nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached by any deſigne of men; for, <hi>Jeſus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceived that they would come, and take him by force, &amp;c.</hi> 6 Chriſt will not approve of any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour offered to him, which he hath not preſcribed and enjoined, were it cloaked with never ſo much of apparent zeal; for, he refuſeth and declineth all this honour, as not required by himſelfe. 7. Albeit Chriſt be a true King over his Church, and do exerciſe a ſpiritual Kingdome in it, and have alſo a ſpiritual government eſtabliſhed, for keeping his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in order; Yet he came not into the world to be a worldly King, nor to adminiſtrate a Kingdome which is of this world: Nor is his Kingdome prejudicial to the thrones and civil government of men, but the beſt pillar they have, if they will ſuffer him to rule among them; Therefore doth Chriſt refuſe all this offer, as not competent to him. And this teacheth his followers, to beware of uſurping Lordly dominion under pretext of adminiſtring the things of his Kingdome. 8. As Chriſts followers ſhould ſhun popular applauſe and worldly pomp, (as their Maſters example here doth teach;) So true zeal againſt theſe ſhould be very fervent and real, and not for the faſhion only; Therefore Chriſt not only prevents their motion before it break forth, but withdraws himſelfe alone, having ſent his diſciples away, that they may not finde him. And this he did; not only to avoid all occaſion of ſuſpicion, or prudently to break their fit of zeal, which could not have been diverted by his ſtaying and reaſoning with them: But alſo to teſtifie how really he abhorred their courſe, and ſo gave a patterne to all his followers, not to put away applauſe ſo, as they would have it follow them, but really to deteſt it. 9. Such as do not make right uſe of Chriſt and his company, but do only expect carnal things of him, are juſtly pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with the want of his company; As here he deals with this people. 10 That Chriſt when he withdrew, went to prayer, (as is remarked, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.22, 23. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.46.) it may teach. 1. Chriſt hath ſanctified to his people the exerciſe of prayer in all their needs, and he is the great Interceſſour for them, under all their miſeries and diſtreſſes; So much doth his practice teach. For, albeit he was true God, and ſo needed not pray, yet as he was a man under the Law, he would pay this homage and fulfill all righteouſneſſe, and by making uſe thereof in his need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. he hath ſanctified this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to all his needy people. And by this practice he teacheth, that as Mediatour, his interceſſion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready in a ſtrait, and he delights in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48148:52"/>
as here he had this peoples folly to pray about, and his diſciples following trial to hold up to the Father. 2. Prayer is a ſpecial mean of entertaining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and a mean of converſe with him, wherein they who are moſt holy, will be moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as Chriſts practice doth teach, who at all occaſions did converſe with his Father in the practice of this duty. 3. Private prayer doth require as much privacy and retiredneſſe as may conveniently be had, that mens ſpirits may ſettle and be compoſed for the dutie; So much alſo doth this practice of Chriſt teach (in going alone to the mountaine to pray) as it is a patterne to us, though he himſelfe was not peſtered with any ſinful diſtractions 4. When men get much applauſe in the world, it is their duty not only to ſhun it, but then to be much in converſe with God; partly, to guard their hearts from being blowen over at unawares; and partly, to make ſure that all is right betwixt God and them; So much alſo may Chriſts practice of prayer at this time, as it is a patterne to us, teach.</p>

                  <p>In theſe <hi>verſes</hi> we have the antecedents of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that the diſciples, at his command, go to Sea without him, and being at Sea in the night time, they are toſſed with a violent tempeſt and contrary winde, as is obſerved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.24.

                     </gap>e <hi>Capernaum</hi> ſtood, and though he landed not at the City, yet he ſtayed not till he came to it. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 1. It is not unuſual, that upon the back of ſweeteſt refreſhments and manifeſtations of Chriſt, the people of God meet with a ſtormy and ſharp exerciſe; Such was the lot of the diſciples after this miracle; for. 1. A conſtant gale of ſweetneſſe is not eaſily born while we are within time, but we muſt be exerciſed with changes. 2. It is meet that he take proofe of our preficiency by former manifeſtations, as being given not only for preſent delight, but for a future uſe; as here he tries how the diſciples faith was ſtrengthened by the former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and ſo is marked, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.51, 52. 3. It is by theſe changes that men get new proofes of their own weakneſſe, and new proofes of his goodneſſe, for the confirmation of their faith. All which they would want, if they had not renewed exerciſe. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 2. As men ſhould be clear of a calling from God to any thing they undertake, that this may ſupport them in what they may meet with, (as the diſciples were <hi>conſtrained</hi> to this journy by Chriſt; <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.22.) So they ought not to judge of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a way, by what they meet with in it; Seeing ſharpeſt trials may meet men in Gods own way, and in the way of their duty; for, when they are going <hi>over the Sea toward</hi> Capernaum, at Chriſts command, the ſtorme ariſeth. 3. The Lords people may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that their trials will be meaſured out according to their grouth, and according to the time which they have had, wherein to make proficiency; for, whereas before this, the deſciples had a tempeſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.23, 24, &amp;c. yet this is now a ſharper trial; Then, Chriſt was with them, though a ſleep, now he is away; Here it is dark night, which we read not of there; Here they have not only a ſtorme of winde, as there, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.37. but a contrary winde, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.48. They are alſo not neere the ſhore, but in the midſt of the Sea, <hi>ver</hi> 19. <hi>Matth</hi> 14.24. And it is long ere Chriſt come to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.25. with which they are not tried in the other ſtorme. 4. In the trials of the Lords people, they may expect that all circumſtances will concurre, that may ſharpen the trial, and make the exerciſe deep: And trials may be compleatly dreadful, wherein yet the Lord will give a good iſſue; for, ſo was this trial ordered in every afflicting circumſtance before marked. See <hi>Lam</hi> 2.22. 5. It is a ſad addition to the trials of the Lords people, that ordinarily they are attended with much confuſion, darkneſſe, and perplexing ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution, ſo that they cannot ſee through their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor what to do under them; So much may be gathered, by analogy, from this circumſtance, that <hi>it was now dark,</hi> when the ſtorme aroſe, ſo that they could not know where they were. And frequently trouble gets the name of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> as the ſaddeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in it. 6. It is Gods way ſo to order his dealing with his people, as eaſie and ſucceſſeful-like beginings may have a very hard procedure, before the way and work be ended; for, here they entred at <hi>even,</hi> and it is ſtill faire till dark night, and that they are far in. By this, Chriſt on the one hand, doth train on and engage his people in his way, and on the other hand, he tries them being engaged, and warnes them to be humble and ſober, when all things inwardly or outwardly ſucceed well with them. 7. It is alſo a great addition to trouble, when Chriſt is abſent, or hides or withdraws himſelfe; The want of him may raiſe a ſtorme in the greateſt calme, and his preſence can make a calme in a ſtorme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be ſad when both they are in trouble and miſſe him; So much may be gathered from this circumſtance, <hi>and Jeſus was not come unto them.</hi> It is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48148:52"/>
true the text ſpeaks of his bodily preſence, which did not alwayes hold off a ſtorme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.23, 24. But if the want of that was ſad to them, how much more muſt it be ſad, when his ſpiritual preſence by faith is wanting in trouble? Yet as he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abſent, when he is not ſeen, ſo it is needful ſometime to be exerciſed with that in trouble, becauſe otherwiſe trials would not be trials. 8. They who, through abundance of enjoyments, are but little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own mercy, or tender of the need of others, are juſtly put to eſſay the caſe of ſuch in their own experience, that they may know the hearts of ſtrangers; for, the diſciples, who through conſtant enjoying of Chriſts company, were oft-times little ſenſible of the caſe of poor ones, who got but now and then an opportunity to meet with him, and who even at the laſt miracle would have had the people ſent away, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.35, 36. are now put to know what it was to want his company in a time of need, that they might love it the better, and pitie others the more. 9. When a people are in a very deſolate and low condition in their own eyes, it may be, they are yet ſo far from iſſue, that harder and ſadder trials are yet to come; for, when they are diſconſolate by reaſon of the dark night and Chriſts abſence; and that before the ſtorme came (as appeares from the order of the narration;) Chriſt, inſtead of coming, ſends a ſad ſtorme, to adde to their bitter condition by the tryſting of all theſe together, <hi>and the Sea aroſe,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19. 10. The Lords people may expect in troubles, that though they will not be drowned nor ſwallowed, yet they will have ſad and fearful toſſings, before they ſee an outgate; for, <hi>the Sea aroſe,</hi> whence the ſhip was <hi>toſſed with waves,</hi> Matth. 14.24. And this is a fit Embleme of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, and the Lords people in it. For. 1. As Mariners are often tempeſt-beaten, by reaſon of the unſettledneſſe of the Element wherein they travel; ſo this world is ſo uncertain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled, and there are ſo many raging luſts of wicked men in it, that it is a wonder if the Church get but one hour for breathing in it. 2. Tempeſts do ſo toſſe Mariners, that they ſtagger, and are put to their wits end, <hi>Pſal</hi> 107.27, and ſo are the Church and godly, in their afflictions, oft-times ſtaggering and like to fall, toſſed, and put from all their reſolutions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.5. 3. Tempeſts are dreadful in this, that preſent death is before men, and but very little betwixt them and it, even a poor thin veſſel, and it much beaten: And ſo alſo may afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions purſue the Lords people, as there will be little betwixt them and death in their own account, and they may have deliverance to ſeek betwixt the jaw bones of death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13. Yet in all this, it is ſweet that it is the Lord who raiſeth the ſtorme, and hath the winds in his fiſts. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 2. It is yet a ſad addition unto trouble, when the Lords people are not only afflicted under their preſent lot, but there is a ſtrong courſe and ſtreame of providence meeting them in the teeth, and cruſhing, and making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, all their endeavours to help themſelves; for, ſo much may be gathered from this, that there was <hi>a great winde that blew,</hi> which not only cauſed the ſea to ariſe, but was contrary to them in their courſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.24. as if heaven were oppoſing any courſe they ſhould eſſay in this extremity, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4.</p>

                  <p>Followeth the miracle itſelfe, or Chriſts coming unto them in a miraculous way, for their comfort in this diſtreſſe; which they miſtaking, are more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. till he by his ſpeaking unto them, do comfort and aſſure them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And theſe are ſome of the conſequents of his miraculous appearance. From <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. As it is a mercy in a ſtrait, to have any known duty, wherein to employ our ſelves; ſo no difficulty ſhould deterre nor diſcourage us from dutie, but the faſter difficulties do grow, we ſhould be the more buſie, even albeit it ſhould be to ſmal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo to do; for, ſo is imported here that they rowed forward, and they were <hi>toiling</hi> with it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.48. Albeit they could promove little thereby, by reaſon of the ſtorme and contrary winde; yet, ſince Chriſt had commanded they ſhould make forward, they hold at the dutie. 2. What ever be the preſſing need of Chriſts followers in troubles, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cleaving to dutie for all that; And whatever be Chriſts purpoſe of love toward them; Yet he ſeeth it fit oft-times, not to come to them at firſt, but will let the trial go on, till it come to an height, and be a trial indeed, and put them ſeriouſly to it; for, before he came, he lets them <hi>row about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs</hi> (the laſt of which make neare four miles, eight furlongs going to a mile) and <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.48. he came not till the fourth watch of the night, which is the morning watch. We are indeed very ſparing of our ſelves in trouble, and do ſoon begin to think that we are low and tried enough, and therefore would be delivered: But our wiſe Lord ſeeth that we need more. 3. What ever be Chriſts delaying to help his people in trouble, and whatever may be their fears and apprehenſions, upon the extremitie of their troubles; Yet deliverance, in his due time, will certainly come unto them, and when their difficulties are at the height, his help will be neareſt, for, here after all their toile, he cometh. 4. Chriſt needs not our diligence, to move him to help us in trouble, but his own knowledge and obſervation of our caſe will plead for pitie and help, when the trial is perfected; for, he cometh unto them, when there is no mention of their crying to him, becauſe (as it is, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.48.) <hi>he ſaw them toiling in rowing.</hi> Albeit it be our duty to call on him in trouble, yet his affection and ſympathy will read ſupplications from our neceſſitie. 5. Chriſt is not only a careful obſerver, and tender ſympathizer in his peoples trouble; but he is ready to come over
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48148:53"/>
all impediments, and to make up the diſtance betwixt them and him, that he may help them; for, when it was impoſſible for them to come to him, he is at the pains, and <hi>walks on the Sea and draws nigh.</hi> 6. Chriſt is omnipotent to bring deliverance unto his people, and to remove impediments out of the way, of their help; And nothing will impede him to come to them in their need, but he who is Lord of all, will make a way through greateſt difficulties: for, he <hi>walks on the Sea, and draws nigh;</hi> whereby he proves himſelfe greater then <hi>Moſes,</hi> who went only through a divided Sea, whereas he walks on the Sea it ſelfe; and proveth that a deep Sea, and a great ſtorme lying betwixt him and his people, will not withhold his company. We are not here to conceive any change wrought in Chriſts body, as if it were denyed of its natural properties that ſo he might thus walk; for, we finde <hi>Peter</hi> walking alſo on the Sea, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.29. But herein appeared the power of his Godhead, carrying his manhead upon the Sea, and any change that was, was wrought on the Sea, which his omnipotency did turn into a pavement to walk on. 7. It is a ſweet ſight of our difficulties, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that what doth moſt affright and trouble us, yet Chriſt is ſecure of it, and hath it under his feet; for, this was the firſt dawning of their deliverance, that Chriſt treads upon that Sea, and makes a walk and way of that which threatned to devoure them, and ſo he proved himſelfe Lord of it, though they were not yet delivered from it. 8. As Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers do meet with more trials then others, ſo ſhall they be made witneſſes of moe proofes of his power and love then others; for, beſide the former mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereof they and the multitude were witneſſes, this new trial brings them the ſight of a new miracle. 9. Chriſt, even when he comes to deliver his people in a remarkable way, may be miſtaken, and even mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be matter of fear and terrour to them; for, when he thus cometh, <hi>they were affraid,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be a ſpirit, and not dreaming of him, as is marked by the reſt. This needs not ſeem ſtrange if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 1. That natural infirmitie, in ſinful man, is apt to be affrighted with ſtrange apparitions, as they conceived this to be. 2. It is natural to men to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruct of the Lords de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling, and to miſapprehend his beſt diſpenſations, and to create groundleſſe fears unto themſelves; and when it is otherwiſe, it is his ſpecial gift and mercy to them. 3. Cruſhing of ſpirit with many troubles, will make any thing take a deep, and readily a wrong, impreſſion on men; As they, being now much broken with their former toſſing and croſſe diſpenſations, look upon this through the ſame perſpective. Mindes broken and cruſhed with many troubles, are but ill judges of Gods dealing. 4. The conſcience of guilt, when it is awaked in a ſtorme, will readily judge of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather according to mens deſervings, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what Chriſt may intend in them. 5. Chriſts method and way, in bringing about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, is oft-times ſo ſtrange, and the means and wayes of it, ſo unlikely, and contrary, in appearance, and ſo like himſelfe, and his power and wiſdome; that it is no wonder our ſhallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions do not take him up at firſt; for, ſuch was his way here. 6. Mens want of faith in trouble, and their limiting of Chriſt to their way and means, not leaving him a latitude, may occaſion many miſtakes when he appeares; for, it appears they were not beleeving that help would come from him, far leſſe, that he would walk upon the Sea, and therefore they miſtake. All theſe being conſidered, may afford us many neceſſary cautions, and may teach us, that it is our own apprehenſions and miſtakes that puts an edge on many of our trials, and not his dealing, if it were rightly underſtood. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27, 28. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 10. When Chriſt hath appeared to deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he may ſee it fit, to put them yet to deeper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and fear, before they come to the comfortable iſſue; He may let trouble be augmented, when he comes to remove it, and may let out the ſharpeſt pang and darkeſt hour, when delivery and day-light are neareſt; for, whatever was their weakneſſe in this miſtake and fear, yet Chriſt not only <hi>drew nigh,</hi> but in his providence ordered that it ſhould be ſo, and for this end, <hi>he would have paſſed by them,</hi> Mark. 6.48. that ſo he might make his appearance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and might trie them, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.28. This way of dealing contributes to humble his people yet more, to fit them for deliverance, and to make it ſweet, when it cometh.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt may, ſometime, delay to appear for his people, and to manifeſt himſelfe unto them in trouble; Yet when the trial is come to an extremity and height, he will not faile ſpeedily to appeare and ſpeak warmly to them; for, now when they are not only afflicted, but in extremitie of fear, he will not have them tortured with it, <hi>but ſaith unto them, it is I.</hi> 2. Chriſt muſt not only appeare, but muſt diſcover himſelfe, before we can diſcerne him, or be free of miſtakes concerning him; for, though he was in their view, yet that did not availe till he ſaid, <hi>it is I.</hi> 3. Chriſts ſpeaking and word is the infallible and ſure mean, whereby he diſcovers himſelfe unto his people, without which, his dealing will be readily miſtaken; And it is from his word that they muſt got the firſt comfortable ſight of their condition, and their begun deliverance muſt be laid hold on there; for, it was his ſilence made his dealing to be miſtaken, and therefore he begins their deliverance and comfort by his word, which will looſe many doubts, <hi>but he ſaith unto them, it is I.</hi> 4. Faithleſſe diſcouraging feare is that which the Lords people moſt readily are inclined to under trouble, as being but the expreſſion of the droſſe of their hearts, and that which is more eaſily a tained, then humility or any other good uſe; Such was their condition here, they were <hi>affraid.</hi> 5. It is acceptable ſervice to God, to oppoſe faithleſſe fears in trial, and to be wreſtling againſt them, when they moſt violently aſſault us; for, there is a command of Chriſt for ſo doing, <hi>be not affraid.</hi> 6. It is the great victory of the Lords people, and a ſufficient deliverance unto them, if when they are in greateſt extremities, they be delivered from ſlaviſh feare; for, ſuch is Chriſts antidote and iſſue allowed on his diſciples, when they are in great danger and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>be not affraid.</hi> 7. The ſoveraigne remedy againſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48148:53"/>
fear in troubles, and the onely right ſight of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is, to ſee Chriſt in them, whoſe preſence, and manifeſting of himſelf, takes away all cauſe of ſlaviſh fear, and who being ſeene to have the chief hand in his peoples trials, it doth warrant them to expect no hurt by them; for, this is the ſovereign remedy of fear, <hi>It is I, be not afraid.</hi> 8. When Chriſt hath propounded moſt ample ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, yet our endeavours thereupon will not remove our fears, nor rectifie our diſpoſitions, till he interpoſe alſo, and apply the encouragement, by his word of command; for, Chriſt counts it not ſufficient to propound that comfortable doctrine, <hi>It is I,</hi> leaving the uſe thereof to be gathered by themſelves, but he enforces the inference with his command, <hi>It is, be not afraid.</hi>

And theſe are the reſt of the conſequents of this his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous coming unto them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Chriſts company ſhould alwayes be ſweet, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his own; ſo trials ought to make their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation thereof to grow, and a known Chriſt will be found ſweet company in trouble; for, <hi>then they willingly received him into the ſhip.</hi> 2. Love to Chriſt, even among diſciples, may grow ſo cold and remiſſe, that there will be need of trials and ſeparation for a time, to quicken it again; for, this was one chief cauſe of all this diſtance and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that they who were (ſo to ſay) cloyed with his company, and therefore thought but little of their condition who came to him upon occaſion; might after this ſeparation and ſtorme, make him more welcome, and <hi>willingly receive him.</hi> Thus doth the Lord cure drowſineſſe and ſecurity, by withdrawing, and making even deſertions bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout much good. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. 3. Whatever be the toſſings and perils wherewith Chriſts followers may be exerciſed; Yet they will not periſh, but will certainly come ſafe to land, one way or other, either ſooner or later, here or hereafter; for, ſo much may be gathered from this inſtance, that the toſſed ſhip and diſciples <hi>came to land.</hi>

                     </gap>. Chriſts preſence being manifeſted to his afflicted people, will produce ſweet changes, and heaps of mercies and wonders, to them, and for them; for, beſide his coming to them in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous way, now there are two wonders more, one, that the ſtorme is calmed, as it is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.32, and another, that they were <hi>immediately at land.</hi> 5. Whatever be the toſſings of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet none of his purpoſes toward them ſhall be made void, and their following of commanded duty ſhall have a good and deſired iſſue; for, it is not their mercie onely, that they get to land any where, (which yet is a mercie to tempeſt beaten men, who may be driven farre from their courſe) nor doth the contrary winde drive them back to the land from whence they came; <hi>But the ſhip was at the land whither they went,</hi> and ſo their voyage held good. 6. Chriſt will let his people loſe none of their toile, wherein they ſpend themſelves (as would appear) to little purpoſe; But he will make it all up with his preſence; and when he cometh, he will further them as much as trouble hath hindered them; for, they who were toiled in rowing againſt a contrary winde, are, upon his coming, <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the land, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Followeth unto the end of the Chapter Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon or conference with his followers, ſome occaſions whereof are recorded,</hi> verſe 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>and the Sermon it ſelf, with the effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents that followed thereupon,</hi> in the reſt of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> we have the occaſions of this Sermon; (which alſo are a further effect of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the loaves;) The firſt whereof is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that the multitude who had been miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſed, knowing that Chriſt had not gone with his diſciples, and that there was no other boat there, did, the next day, expect that poſſibly they would finde him there ſtill, on the mountain to which he went: But finding him gone, as well as the diſciples, they (being provided of other boats, as is marked, <hi>verſe</hi> 23.) do follow and ſeek him. The other occaſion of the conference, (<hi>verſe</hi> 25.) is more near, that having found him, they enter into familiar diſcourſe with him, and enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his getting to that place. It is not needful to determine, whether they ſuſpected any thing of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48148:54"/>
his miraculous paſſage; Though it be not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they were taught, as well as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, thereby: And one work of Chriſt in feeding men miraculouſly, may diſcover more of him, and that he can paſſe over a ſea without a boat; And they who were on land, free of a ſtorme, may have a better fight of Chriſts power, then diſciples in their perplexity, whoſe judgements and diſcerning were confounded with tentation and trouble: Yea their narrow marking of circumſtances, that there was no other boat there, may import they ſuſpected it, by their following him when they found him not there: And indeed, narrow conſideration will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more of him, then ſleight obſervers do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily remark. But that which is certainly cleare, is, that they, not finding him there, do ſeek him where his diſciples were, and providence furniſheth them with boats for their paſſage. From <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23, 24. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The hot moods and fits of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries will not alwayes coole at the firſt, but they may continue very earneſt for a while; for ſo did it prove in this people, who, it ſeemes, ſtayed all night in the deſert place watching for him, and are eagerly ſeeking him <hi>the day following.</hi> They are ſaid to <hi>ſtand on the other ſide of the ſea,</hi> though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert near to <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> was on the ſame ſide with <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where Chriſt now was; becauſe the neareſt way to it was by ſea, and the diſciples had gone that way. 2. Such as follow Chriſt but for a wrong end, he will ſoone be weary of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and they will loſe it; for, ſo did it fare with theſe, <hi>Jeſus was not there,</hi> but had ſlipped from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ere they were aware. 3. When Chriſt is away, it is the duty of ſuch as reſpect him, to reſolve to follow him on any tearmes; And even temporaries will not be put away with every repulſe, but may ſeeme, for a time, to follow the faſter; for, ſuch is their practice here, they will go after and ſeek him, though they ſhould leave their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and intereſts. 4. It is great folly and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in men, to do at upon places wherein Chriſt hath gloriouſly manifeſted himſelf, when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thence in the ordinary ſignes of his preſence; for, ſo much doth their practice teach, they would not ſtay in that place, (though famous for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and Chriſts preſence,) when he is away, but do follow him. 5. When Chriſt is withdrawn, men will be at a loſſe where to finde him, and to know whither he is gone, if they conſult with reaſon; for, ſo much do they finde, he is not there, and yet they cannot (when they have conſidered all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) diſcerne how, or whither he is gone. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. 6. Albeit Chriſt be not alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſeene in the company of his diſciples, yet it is ſafeſt ſeeking him where they are, for, ſo do they, with good ſucceſſe. They ſaw him not go with his diſciples, yet they <hi>came to Capernaum, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Jeſus,</hi> not onely becauſe that was the place of his education, but becauſe the diſciples went thitherward, as it is like they knew when they went away. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7, 8. 7. Such as have their heart and eye on Chriſt, reſolving to follow him, his providence will ſerve them with means that they may follow him; for, they who reſolve to follow, and had no boats, are within a while provided, as <hi>verſe</hi> 23. And if he do ſo to hollow-hearted men, how much more to others? 8. In mentioning the place of the miracle, <hi>John</hi> takes notice that they did eat bread, <hi>after that the Lord had given thanks,</hi> to ſhew 1. That ſpiritual minds are much taken up with obſervation of ſpiritual things, even when greateſt outward wonders are a working; for, he paſſeth the miracle in a word, but ſpeaks more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that refreſhing and edifying thankſgiving. 2. Chriſts way of ſpeaking to his Father, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and praiſe, was very raviſhing, and did take deep impreſſion upon ſpiritual obſervers, who were witneſſes of it; Therefore, is it now ſo warmely remembred by <hi>John.</hi> 3. It is one great leſſon in Chriſts ſchoole, to learn that the bleſſing of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are in Gods hand, and to fall in love with prayer and praiſe, as the mean of drawing out that bleſſing, as it is needed; Therefore, alſo <hi>John</hi> remembers the thankſgiving or bleſſing, eſpecially as the mean of drawing down the bleſſing on theſe few loaves. 4. Such as are due obſervers of Chriſts wonderful works, will have high and reverend thoughts of him; Therefore, <hi>John</hi> doth on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion name him <hi>the Lord. Doctrine</hi> 9. Such as are but temporaries, and hollow-hearted, may get through without difficulties, where Chriſts peculiar follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will meet with ſtormes; he having more proofs of love to let out on them, and to them; for, they get through the ſea eaſily, where the diſciples were tempeſt beaten.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt may condeſcend to be found even of hollow hearted men who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: That ſo he may witneſſe that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is of themſelves, and that he is willing to to reclaim them: And that he may give a publike teſtimony, how willing he is to receive ſincere ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when he is ſo condeſcending to ſuch as theſe; for, <hi>they found him on the other ſide of the ſea,</hi> to wit, at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> as appeareth <hi>verſe</hi> 24. with 59. For albeit Chriſt landed in the Countrey beſide, where he wrought ſome cures, as is recorded in the parallel places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.34. &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.53. &amp;c. yet he was entered the City before theſe men met with him. 2. Temporaries may have as much ſhew and outſide, as theſe who are ſincere; ſo that none are to be tried thereby, but men muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true piety and familiarity with Chriſt, and a ſhew or eſtimation of it; for, they make a great noiſe and fair ſhew, when they came to Chriſt. 3. Temporaries may give Chriſt very fair language and titles, it that will ſuffice him, and will not fail ſo to do it, ſo long as he doth not croſſe their idols and deſignes; for, their compellation is <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> 4. Temporaries alſo may pretend to very great familiarity with Chriſt, and may think themſelves very great in his Court, and homely with him; So much doth this familiar queſtion about his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, import. They judged that the great work he had done for them, had made them of worth before him, and great men in his account. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the flouriſhe and pretences of hollow-hearts, or their paines in following Chriſt; yet this doth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48148:54"/>
witneſſe their unſoundneſſe, that they make no right uſe of him, when they have the opportunity, but do curiouſly and idely paſſe away their time; for, all they have to ſay, is, <hi>Rabbi, when cameſt thou hither?</hi> which ſeemeth to relate not onely to the time, but to the manner alſo of his coming. And albeit it give ſome hint, that they ſuſpected he came in a miraculous way, yet they were but curious and idle in propounding the queſtions, as the ſequel more fully cleareth.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place, Chriſt (in this <hi>verſe</hi>) diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them unto themſelves, ſhewing that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their pains and inſinuations with him, yet they were not ſtreight in their ends; nor were they ſo much as affected with his glory ſhining in that miracle they had ſeene; but it was onely the filling of their own bellies that made them ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is neither taken, not will be deceived with faireſt ſhewes of pains, and much reſpect to him; but will ſee and diſcover un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe, when yet there is much outward appearance to the contrary: Therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their pains in following him, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. he knoweth, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being affected with what they did, declareth what they were. And his verdict is to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto. 2. Chriſt is ſo tender, even of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that he will not abruptly put them away, but will deal with them: And as their caſe muſt be told them before they can know it, ſo he will diſcover them unto themſelves, and take pains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſo long as they will ſtay with him, and heat; Therefore he doth not abandon them, though carnal, but <hi>anſwered them:</hi> and in great compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcovers their caſe, that they may not deceive themſelves. 3. Albeit it be a moſt needful thing, that men of double hearts be diſcovered to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ſo way may be made for a cure: Yet it is a very hard task to convince hypocrites, and make them ſenſible of their condition; Conſidering that men are naturally blind; that their outward pains may make them appear ſomewhat in their own eyes; and, that moſt of ſuch go on, till they be judicially blinded and given up to conceit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is this doctrine begun with a double aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> as pointing out the neceſſity of this doctrine, and withal, how difficult it is for ſuch doctrine to have place. 4. Albeit painfulneſſe be commendable, yet the true difference betwixt time-ſervers and ſincere profeſſors is not alwayes to be taken from their outward dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But they may be exceeding diligent, who yet are not welcome to Chriſt, but have a falſe heart lurking under it: And there may be much unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under ſeeming forwardneſſe, as caſts it all down: for, here it is granted to them, <hi>ye ſeek me,</hi> and that with as much forwardneſſe once and again, as could be, and yet they are but naught. See <hi>Pſalme</hi> 78, 34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58, 1, 2. 5. Albeit Chriſt be diſpleaſed with the faults of hypocrites ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48148:55"/>
of him; Yet he is ſo tender, that he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove even of their pains and endeavours, in ſo far as they are materially good in themſelves, though they go about them ſinfully: Therefore, he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>ye ſeek me,</hi> and doth not condemne, but yeelds to that, as good in it ſelfe, if they had done it rightly. 6. Chriſt, in trying of men, looks not only to their diligence, that for matter it be aggreeable to his will; but chiefly to the ends and principles of men, and their manner of doing that which is right; for, he trieth them thus here, by pointing out wherefore, and for what cauſe they ſeek him. 7. As it is a rare thing to ſee men, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the next place; Chriſt, having thus reproved them, doth alſo direct them how to amend their fault, by employing their paines and care, chiefly about the ſpiritual good of their ſouls, and not about theſe periſhing things. And this he preſſeth upon them, partly, from the conſideration of the one and the other food; and partly, from his promiſe to give that ſpiritual food unto them, if they ſeek it ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which he confirmeth, further, from his being authorized, furniſhed and manifeſted to be the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, the Saviour and helper of loſt ſinners. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Chriſt doth not reprove the faults of men out of malicious ſplene; but he is ſo ready to cheriſh deſires of ſeeking himſelf, that even when men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in ſeeking him, he reproves them, not to put them away, but to cure them, and make them ſound; Therefore, doth he ſubjoyne this direction, and warme encouragement, to the former reproofe. 2. As un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe in ſeeking Chriſt is a diſeaſe that muſt be cured, otherwiſe it will draw on perdition; So even that is a diſeaſe which Chriſt is ready to cure, and hath medecine for; So much appeareth in this pains taken on theſe ſeekers. 3. Men will never employ themſelves rightly in ſeeking Chriſt, till firſt their hearts be weaned from earthly things, and fall moſt in love with what concerns their ſouls eternal welfare; and till the things of the world ceaſe to be their principal labour and end, and they ceaſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt and religion, for worldly ends and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; for, ſo much is imported in this direction, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat, &amp;c.</hi> Which prohibition is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood abſolutely, as if it were ſimply unlawful to labour, or take pains about the things of the world, for that is contrary to Scripture rules, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. And if the World were kept in it's own roome, it would prove no enemy to grace: But it is to be taken comparatively (as in the like phraſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13.) that they ſhould not only, or chiefly be taken up with the world, neglecting what is better, as all mankinde is ſince <hi>Adam</hi> fell from God to the creature; and, that they ſhould not make the world their aime in ſeeking him, as they did. 4. Albeit men can merit no more by their works, then the beggers craving merits the almes; Yet men are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they will come to the enjoyment of ſpiritual things, with idleneſſe, or wiſhes only; But they muſt be at pains for them, and ſuch pains, as fleſh and blood will finde it hard labour; for, ſaith he, <hi>labour not — but for that meat, &amp;c.</hi> where he diverts their affections and eagerneſſe from off theſe earthly things, and ſets them upon the right object. 5. It may help to wean our hearts from the world, when we conſider that, however natural hearts feed upon the things of the world, and their ſoules imagine ſatisfaction in them; Yet, if they had the world at their will, they will get no more of it, but their bit meat, which the pooreſt may attain unto: Therefore, doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all earthly things under the name of <hi>meat,</hi> not only, becauſe it was their meat they were now moſt taken up with; but to point out what was the moſt they might expect of the things of time, let them have what dreams they pleaſe; and, to ſuggeſt an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why they ſhould not toile ſo much for that which could afford them ſo little. See, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.11. 6. It may alſo coole our affections to the world, when we conſider, that, however men want not enough of toile, when they embrace the world for a portion, (for, they <hi>labour for this meat:</hi>) Yet, all they labour for, is but of a periſhing nature, and periſheth in the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.17. It ſerves but to uphold a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life; and cannot prevent it's periſhing at laſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. And, where ſouls get no better, and men do only and mainly labour for it, it will cauſe them periſh eternally; for, this is another ground of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, it is <hi>the meat which periſheth.</hi> 7. Chriſt doth here commend himſelfe and his ſpiritual graces, to be laboured for, under the name of <hi>meat.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now they were earneſtly ſeeking for meat, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he points out himſelfe as excellent and better meat;

To ſhew the neceſſity ſinners have of Chriſt, and his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to them; for, as meat is the mean of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving life, ſo not only unrenewed ſinners continue dead without him, but the ſouls of theſe who have any life, will be in peril of ſtarving without him: and if they feed upon him, their ſouls ſhall live, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by him. 3. To ſhew his love, who, as meat is prepared for eating, by fire; ſo he was content to be roſted in the fire of Gods diſpleaſure, that he might be fit food for ſtarving and pining ſouls. 4. To ſhew the neare conjunction that muſt be betwixt Chriſt and them who reap ſpiritual benefit by him; for, as food muſt be eaten, and digeſted, and turned into our ſubſtance, before it can nouriſh, ſo muſt we apply Chriſt, and have him dwelling in us, before we draw forth of his refreſhing vertue. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 8. It doth commend Chriſt, and may quicken our appetite and deſire after him, that he is food which neither periſheth in uſing, nor diminiſheth, how manyſoever partake of it, and maketh them who partake thereof, to endure and be happy for ever: and therefore ought to be eſteemed of above other food, as much as our ſouls are better then our bodies, and our eternal welfare to be preferred to our temporal life: for, it is another argument preſſing this labour, he is <hi>that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life,</hi> both in himſelfe, and in his effects in believers. 9. Albeit, oft-times, ſuch as labour moſt for earthly things, may ſtarve and want, for all their pains; Yet it may encourage men to ſeek Chriſt, that none ſhall do it in vain, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſee it fit to ſharpen their appetite with delay, yet he will at laſt ſatisfie them; Therefore doth he quicken them yet more with a promiſe, that what they labour for, ſhall be <hi>given.</hi> 10. Chriſt is ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and faithful in rewarding them who ſeek him, that even carnal hypocrites will not be refuſed, if they quit their unſoundneſſe, and put him in the roome of the Idol they are ſeeking; for, on theſe tearmes, the promiſe is made, even to theſe whom he had reproved, <hi>to you.</hi> 11. Whatever pains men are bound to take, or do take in ſeeking Chriſt, yet all the reward they receive, is of free gift, and ſinners ſeekers will ſee it to be ſo; for, he <hi>ſhall give it unto you,</hi> ſaith he. 12. As Chriſt is the true food of ſouls, ſo is he the giver thereof, and all of it muſt come through his hand; for, <hi>the Sonne of man ſhall give</hi> it, not only by giving himſelfe to death, that he might purchaſe life, and become fit food, but by the actual application of himſelfe, and his purchaſed benefits, to every hungry ſinner. 13. Chriſts aſſinitie to us, and his being our kinſman, and of the ſame nature with us, is a pledge to them that ſeek him, that he will tenderly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply their neceſſities; Therefore doth he take the name of the <hi>Sonne of man</hi> in this promiſe, to ſhew that he whoſe delight was among the ſons of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. and delighted to deſigne himſelfe often by this name, and he who took on our nature, and ſtouped to ſubject himſelfe to our ſinleſs infirmities, will be tender of them who come to him, and need him. 14. Chriſt is to be acknowledged to be he whom the Father hath authorized, and furniſhed to be the Saviour and Redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So Chriſt is the Fathers great Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, authorized and ſent out by him to this work; partly, that as a ſeal repreſents on waxe that which is engraven on it; So the Father hath communicate to him his divine eſſence and properties, and ſtamped and filled him with all divine perfections, for carrying on that work; having the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelling in him; all knowledge, to reveal his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and direct his people; affection, to come down from heaven for ſinners good, and to love them who abhorred him; the ſpirit without meaſure, to refreſh, power, to ſuſtain them, &amp;c.

Men by nature cannot take up the right way of juſtification and ſalvation, as being a myſtery; And particularly, Men by nature do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a deep impreſſion of the firſt Covenant of works, and are ſo ignorant of the perfection of the law, and of their own impotency, that they know no way of acceptance before God, but the way of works, and doubt no more of themſelves, but if Chriſt tell them their duty, they will do it; for, ſuch is their principle and bold undertaking here, <hi>What ſhall we do, that we might work?</hi> that is, tell us, and we ſhall do it.

But he gives it this name, ſpeaking in their own tearmes who doated on works, and ſo the doctrine of faith is called a <hi>law,</hi> Rom. 3.27. becauſe the Jewes boaſted ſo much of the law. And though other duties be required alſo of his people; yet he names this only, becauſe it only embraceth Chriſt for righteouſneſſe and life; it is the only remedy for a ſoul lying under the conſcience of guilt or any difficulties; and, it is through faith that we can do any good work, and that they are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the imperfections thereof covered. 6. No faith will ſerve mens turn for juſtification and life, but that which cloſeth with, and embraceth Chriſt the Mediatour, as ſent of the Father, by his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manifeſtation in the fleſh, and by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing of him to exerce that office; for, ſo is here required, <hi>that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Whereby he warnes men not to reſt on general aſſents to every divine truth, as a faith ſufficient for ſalvation, unleſſe they cloſe with Chriſt; And teacheth, That it is no ſaving faith, to acknowledge and believe in God, where Chriſt is not acknowledged; That it is not enough to profeſſe faith in a Meſſiah (as the Jews did) unleſſe Chriſt be taken up and acknowledged to be that Meſſiah already manifeſted; So 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 4.2, 3.

                  <p>Chriſt in anſwering to this queſtion, doth not meddle with their asking of a ſigne, but as before he cleared the way of attaining this ſpiritual food, ſo here he takes occaſion to ſet forth the excellency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by comparing it with, and preferring it unto the Manna, whereof they boaſted ſo much. The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is propounded in this <hi>ver.</hi> which may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly underſtood, As, 1. That it was not <hi>Moſes</hi> (of whom they gloried in oppoſition to him) who gave them, even that Manna; for it was the Father that gave it, upon <hi>Moſes</hi> petition, who alſo doth now offer this true bread, and that of free grace, without any previous deſire of theirs. This is a truth in it ſelfe, and ſheweth, how Chriſt will debaſe them whom men do injuſtly cry up, to the prejudice of truth; But it doth not reach Chriſts full ſcope here. 2. That the Manna was not given from heaven, that is, from the celeſtial heaven, but only from the aire and clouds, which frequently in the Old Teſtament is called <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But Chriſt, this ſpiritual food, is given from the heaven of glory. Yet neither doth this exhauſt the ſcope. Therefore. 3 I take the compariſon to be inſtitute betwixt the nature and effects of Manna, which was given by the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and this food, given by the Father; That, however Manna was a Sacrament and type of Chriſt, and in that reſpect is called <hi>ſpiritual meat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. Yet it was not bread from heaven, or true ſpiritual food, in effect and of it ſelfe; but only bodily food. But this is <hi>true bread from heaven,</hi> that is, real ſpiritual food, and the ſubſtance and truth of all theſe types pointing it out. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is not to any purpoſe to follow a contentious and quarreling people, in their endleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with Chriſt, and about his doctrine; But the beſt way of dealing with them, is, conſtantly to hold out unto them their need of Chriſt, and that ſingular excellency that is in him; Therefore, Chriſt ſtands not to debate with them about ſignes, but goeth on to point the excellency of this food, and how needful it was for them, if they looked for life. 2. Unbeliefe is a diſeaſe ill to be cured, and it is no eaſie matter to draw men from doating on the external priviledges they have enjoyed, that they may learn to prize and eſteeme of what is ſpiritual and more excellent; Therefore Chriſt, in preſſing this doctrine, muſt uſe doubled aſſeverations, <hi>verily, verily,</hi> becauſe they would account but little of his bare word in this matter. 3. There is no outward priviledge enjoyed of old, and which the Church wants under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but it is all made up in Chriſt with advantage; for, here, better bread is daily offered then that of Manna was. 4. Chriſt is the truth and ſubſtance of all the types in the Old Teſtament. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the type of Manna is fulfilled in him, in his Incarnation and coming in the world. In his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, he comes from a better heaven then that whence Manna came; He is but little, ſmall and deſpiſed in the eyes of men, and yet is white and ſpotleſſe, as Manna was, and of a ſweeter taſte to right diſcerners; and feeds and entertains a better life, then Manna did: He is alſufficient to feed all his people, (as Manna furniſhed all <hi>Iſrael</hi>) and is laid freely forth, to be gathered and received by all of them; as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fell daily round about the camp; And, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beleever ſhall not come behinde with the ſtrongeſt, in ſharing in him, according as the Manna was equally divided. Therefore is he called the <hi>true bread from heaven,</hi> with relation to Manna as the type, 5. The holieſt of Miniſters do not conferre the thing ſignified in a Sacrament, nor is the outward element of the Sacrament, the thing ſignified by it, which feeds the ſoul; But God hath the giving of that in his own hand, and if he be not employed, men will get but the earthly part of the Sacrament: Therefore albeit <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Miniſter in giving them Manna, which was the type and outward element, yet, ſaith he, Moſes <hi>gave you not that bread from heaven,</hi> or the thing ſignified, <hi>but my Father giveth, &amp;c.</hi> And thus he not only debaſeth Manna in compariſon of himſelfe, but ſpeaks the more meanly of it, in reſpect they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſo much to the ſpiritual ſignification thereof, but only propounded it as an inſtance, to invite Chriſt to give the like carnal ſatisfaction to their bellies. 6. Such as ſtand in need of true ſpiritual food, have both the Father and the Sonne ready and engaged to give it unto them; for, whereas he had ſaid, <hi>the Sonne of man ſhall give it unto you,</hi> ver. 27. now ſaith he, <hi>my Father giveth the true bread;</hi> Wherein he doth not only, as Mediatour, give the glory of all to his Father; but ſheweth that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concurreth with him in this, and giveth it by his hand. 7. Even ſuch as are, for preſent, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and unſound, are not ſecluded from the offer of Chriſt, but, upon right tearmes, may expect that he will be gifted to them; Therefore, ſaith he, even to theſe hearers, <hi>but my Father giveth you, &amp;c.</hi> that is, by me maketh offer of it, to be embraced upon right tearms, and in the due order.</p>

Albeit not only Manna, but even our ordinary refreſhments,

are of God, and from him; Yet Chriſt is the bread of God by way of excellency, as being indeed divine food; and food for our better part, and food wherein God manifeſts his riches and fulneſſe as God, and wherein he ought to be clearly ſeen: Therefore ſaith he, <hi>the bread of God is he, &amp;c.</hi> or, he is divine bread, and bread which comes from God in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way. And he ſpeaks of this bread as a perſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving action, <hi>he cometh down, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe it is Chriſts perſon and benefits accompanying him, which, being applyed, do give life. 2. Benefits of God ought to be in eſteem with us, according as they have much of God ſhining clearly in them, and in giving of them; which will commend ſpiritual benefits before temporal, and leſſer benefits, coming more immediatly and ſenſibly from his hand, before greater favours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that is not ſo viſible; for, this is an argument to commend him as the true bread; <hi>for he is the bread of God.</hi> 3.

Mans loſt and dead condition is irremediable by himſelfe, or any other mean under heaven; for, this life muſt <hi>come down from heaven.</hi> 5. Chriſt is the true bread and food, that not only preſerves life, and keeps from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, but doth put life and quickening even in the dead; And ſuch as do partake of Chriſt, will live, and become lively in their motions and actions; for, this <hi>bread of God giveth life.</hi> 6. Chriſt (that he might become fit food to quicken dead ſouls, and might ſtoop to them who could not aſcend to him) hath been pleaſed to come down from heaven to earth, unto ſinners, Not in regard of his Godheads changing of place, ſeeing he fills heaven and earth, but in regard of ſtate, in that he ſtooped to be incarnate, and did aſſume our nature on earth, by a perſonal union to himſelfe; Nor yet that his humane nature was from heaven, but that the ſanctification, manner of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perſonal union thereof unto the Godhead, was divine and from heaven, and wrought by the vertue and power of the holy Ghoſt: In theſe reſpects is this bread of God commended, that <hi>he cometh down from heaven, and giveth life</hi> 7. The ſpiritual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and refreſhments of Chriſt are not proper to <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, but common to all Nations; And as the offer is made indifferently to all ſorts of perſons, where the Goſpel cometh; So he is applyed to his own elect, of all Nations and ranks of perſons; for, he <hi>giveth life unto the world,</hi> not to <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, but to his own of all ſorts and conditions throughout the world, who in themſelves diſter nothing from the reſt of the world till grace prevent them, and therefore they get the common name of <hi>the world.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſts commending of this bread, produceth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement deſire, and earneſt petition for it; Albeit they had wickedneſſe enough to propound this deſire by way of taunt, deſiring him who made ſuch faire offers, to give ſome real proofes of it; Yet it ſeems rather to ſlow from their ignorant and carnal diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who hearing of ſuch bread, and conceiving of it but carnally, they deſire to partake of it conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of the Manna. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The commendation of ſpiritual things may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſtrange motions, and deſires and affections in men, who yet are but carnal; while as they have but carnal conceptions of things ſpiritual, and their deſires are neither ſerious, nor conſtant, nor labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; for, here, the former commendation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth very vehement deſires, and ſtrong inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Chriſt, calling him, <hi>Lord,</hi> that they may have their will, and yet the iſſue proves them to be but naught in all this. 2. As all men by nature are carnal, ſo their conceptions of things ſpiritual are but carnal, and their deſires are agreeable to ther diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for, ſuch was their conception and deſire here; they are far from Chriſts purpoſe, and dream of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bodily refreſhment in all this. 3.

                  <p>Chriſt returns an anſwer to this deſire to <hi>ver.</hi> 41. Wherein. 1. He deſcribes more plainly, what, and who this bread is, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. 2. He diſcovers their hypocriſie, and checks them that for not being that in reality, which here they pretend to in their deſires, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. 3. He ſheweth that his own Elect would not deale ſo with him, and ſhould be well dealt with, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as was given him in Commiſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38, 39, 40.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Chriſt, upon occaſion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, doth declare what and who this bread of life is. He had told before the excellency thereof, and that he and his Father would give it to them who ſeek it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; Now he brings out more of his minde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he is the bread of life. 2. He doth again repeat and inculcate the way of partaking of this bread, which is by beleeving and coming to him, of which, See <hi>chap.</hi> 5.40. 3. He confirmes that he is the bread of life, and points out the excellency thereof, from an effect, which is, that the partakers of him, ſhall finde compleat refreſhment in him, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and perpetuating of their ſpiritual life. <hi>Whence
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48148:59"/>
learn.</hi> 1. Chriſt is ſo tender of any deſires after himſelfe, that he will labour and take pains to make the beſt that can be, even of natural and carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and not caſt them away at firſt, but labour to make them better, and ſet them right; Therefore doth he anſwer this carnal crew, and propound an object, to elevate their deſires. 2. A right ſight of Chriſt, and his commending of himſelfe to ſinners, is a ſpecial mean to make deſires ſpiritual, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them toward him; for, he points out and commends himſelfe here, for that end. 3. Chriſt is not only the giver of that food which begets and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains ſpiritual life, and which is moſt neceſſary, and ſhould be moſt ſweet to ſinners: But he himſelfe is the food of our ſouls alſo, who gave himſelfe to death, that he might be prepared meat for us, who by his merit doth purchaſe life, and by his efficacy, being applied, doth diſpenſe and entertaine that life; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> that is, who hath life in himſelfe, and who merits, begets, maintains, and perfects life, in them who embrace and apply him. And he ſpeaks of himſelfe under the notion of <hi>bread,</hi> becauſe it was bread which that carnal people was ſeeking. 4. The right way of feeding on Chriſt for the entertainment of ſpiritual life, and of finding him the bread of life, is, by faith to embrace and cloſe with him, his perſon, offices, and offers, and exerciſe our faith on him daily; for, he is the bread of life to him <hi>that beleeveth.</hi> 5. To come to Chriſt, and to beleeve in him, are all one; And he that is made ſenſible of his diſtance from Chriſt, and of the excellency and fulneſſe that is in him, and doth turn his courſe and eye toward him, and is ſtill moving on toward him, is a beleever whatever he enjoy: for, <hi>he that cometh unto me,</hi> is explained by this, <hi>he that beleeveth on me.</hi> 6. Chriſts offers unto all and every one that cometh unto him, are not faire complements, but produce real ſatisfaction; As this promiſe ſubjoyned doth teach. 7. As all they who come not to Chriſt, will eternally pine away, under the want of all ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So they who embrace him, ſhall finde alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in him for all wants, and that eternally; for, this bread ſatisfieth both <hi>hunger and thirſt,</hi> as in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe <hi>bread</hi> is put for all bodily refreſhment: And it is promiſed, he ſhall <hi>never hunger,</hi> and <hi>never thirſt.</hi> Whereby we are to underſtand. 1. That they who embrace him, though they will long after more of him, yet they ſhall never again hunger after the husks of ſinne, nor after ſatisfaction thereby to the luſts of the fleſh. 2. Albeit there will be luſtings and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after theſe, even in them who have embraced Chriſt; Yet in ſo far as they have come to Chriſt, and are renewed, they will be rid of them. 3. They ſhall not any more pine under the deſtroying hunger of total want, though they will ſtill have an hunger of wholeſome appetite to prepare them for feeding, and have food at hand to ſupply and ſatisfie it. 4. This promiſe, of being delivered from hunger and thirſt, is but begun to be accompliſhed here, and daily going on, and ſhall be perfected hereafter, when believers ſhall enjoy compleat and total ſatisfaction throughout all eternity.</p>

                  <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> Chriſt doth ſadly regrate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their hypocriſie, and that, notwithſtanding all their faire pretences, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. yet, they were but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſpiſers of him; in that, however they had not only ſeen him, but were convinced what he was, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. yet, they would not beleeve. And this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be the more odious, that he had told them of it before, and yet they had not amended it. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. When Chriſt is manifeſting himſelfe, by his Word or working, unto a people, then his eye is upon them, marking how they profit; So much doth he intimate unto them here. See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. 2. Chriſt will not be deceived with faire ſhewes in a people, but can diſcover a rotten and perverſe heart, under plauſible pretences and profeſſions; for, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſeemed to be ſo earneſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. that there needed no more but to diſcover and offer that bread unto them, and they would embrace it; he ſheweth that it was far otherwiſe, and that it was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or want of opportunity, but perverſeneſſe, that kept them back. 3. It is no wonder that Chriſt be much greeved with, and have many ſad complaints of unfruitful and hypocritical hearers; conſidering their deceitful hypocriſie, the great injury they do to him, by ſleighting of him, and, that they deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſo ſweet advantages by him; Therefore doth he, who knew them well enough, and what a ſweet offer of life they ſleighted, break out in this ſad rebuke, the manner whereof ſheweth that it came from a grieved ſpirit. 4. As men may come a great length in conviction and knowledge, who yet do not beleeve; So whatever they attain by hearing, Chriſt will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it all nothing, if they come not to cloſe with him by faith; without which, neither is he honoured, nor do they reap profit; for, Chriſt grants they had <hi>ſeen</hi> him, and yet that avails not, ſince they <hi>beleeve not.</hi> 5. The more conviction and light men have in the matters of Chriſt and the Goſpel, their unbeliefe is the more odious; for, thus doth he aggreage their ſinne, <hi>ye alſo have ſeen me, and beleeve not.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37. and 15, 22, 24. 6. It doth alſo aggravate the ſinne of unbeliefe, and prove the unſoundneſſe of men, that they have been often told of their fault, and yet do not amend it; for, this addes unto the challenge, that he had told them of it before, <hi>But I ſaid unto you,</hi> &amp;c. And albeit we finde it not directly mentioned before, yet we are not to doubt of it, ſince he aſſerts that he had ſaid it, and we finde it inſinuate, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. where he tells them they followed him for carnal ends, even after conviction, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 7. So long as ſinners are not aſhamed to continue in their courſes of unbeliefe, and ſleighting of Chriſt, Miniſters ſhould not weary to tell them of it, over and over again; for, ſo much doth Chriſts example teach, who having reproved this fault, doth not faile to inculcate it again.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt, having thus pointed out their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in unbelief, doth (to <hi>verſe</hi> 41.) comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtrengthen the weak, who might ſtumble at the unbelief of ſo many, by aſcending up to the fountain of faith and converſion; aſſuring himſelf that the Elect would come unto him, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all tender uſage and welcome to them; which he confirmes by reading over his Commiſſion unto them. And by this means alſo, he layeth before them their ſad caſe, and that their practice ſaid much to it, that they did not belong unto him; Yet ſo as he doth not terrifie, but warmly invite any who had a minde to come to him. In this <hi>verſe,</hi> 1. He comforts himſelf, that, misbeleeve who would, yet, undoubtedly all theſe that were given unto him, would come unto him. 2. He aſſureth all theſe who come, of tender and warme acceptance. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit many who ſleight Chriſts call, may yet be elect, and at laſt embrace him; And albeit we cannot certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Reprobation of any in this life, by any mark in them, if it be not found that they have ſinned unto death; Yet to reject Chriſt after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, is an evidence of a reprobate condition, and ſuch as continue in it, have ſad cauſe of fear, leſt they be indeed Reprobates: And whatever be Chriſts purpoſe toward any, yet it is a ſpecial mean to terrifie ſinners from their refuſing of Chriſt, to afright them with Reprobation: for, ſo doth Chriſt here deale with theſe unbeleevers, pointing out unto them what their way might portend of them. 2. However Chriſt and his ſervants have oft-times cauſe to complain of the ſmall fruit of their labours; yet this is matter of comfort, that all the Elect will, in due time, be brought in; for, ſo doth Chriſt comfort himſelf here. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. 3. Albeit the offer of the Goſpel be made generally to all, to all who hear it: Yet the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all purpoſe of God for good is toward ſome onely, and not others; for, there are who are <hi>given</hi> by <hi>the Father,</hi> and not others. 4. It is the great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and happineſſe of the Elect, that they are from eternity given to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as the reward of his ſufferings, to come to him in due time: And that they are given to him in truſt, to be accountable and forth-coming for them; for, ſo is here declared, that there are whom <hi>the Father giveth him.</hi> Wherein is imported, that they were the Fathers firſt, not onely by vertue of his general right in all creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. but by particular Election; and that being the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are given to Chriſt, both from eternity, to be redeemed by him, and as the reward of his ſufferings; And in time, to be drawn to him, and therefore both the Father <hi>giveth</hi> them, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and, <hi>hath given,</hi> them of before, <hi>verſe</hi> 39. See <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.30. 5. As theſe who are thus given unto Chriſt, are many, how many ſoever reject him; So they are high in his eſteeme, and as much as if all were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him: Therefore are they called <hi>All that the Father giveth,</hi> not onely to ſhew their number, but the word in the Original is more emphatick, and importeth as much as, all things, to ſhew, that, indeed they are his <hi>all,</hi> and that he accounts of them as much as, and above <hi>all things</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide And thus the expreſſion is more clearly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. 6. The Elect, and ſuch as are given to Chriſt, may, for a time, be, and really by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, as farre away and eſtranged from him, as any other; for, they are given, and yet are to <hi>come</hi> to him. This may make them thankful, humble, and charitable, when they are converted. 7. Such as are elected and given to Chriſt, will certainly, in due time, come to him; Their being given from eternity produceth their being given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time, for God is faithful, who will not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Chriſt of what he hath purchaſed, and the power that draweth them, is invincible and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible: Therefore ſaith he, <hi>all that the Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> 8. Converſion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Chriſt, is not a cauſe, nor is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof antecedent to Election, but it is onely a fruit following thereupon; for, ſuch is the order here, they are <hi>given by the Father,</hi> and upon that, their <hi>coming</hi> neceſſarily followeth. See <hi>Acts</hi> 13 48. 9. It is not mens moral changes, nor their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing external ordinances, that proves them given to Chriſt, but their coming to him, and cloſing with, and embracing of himſelf, as Mediatour; for, ſo are we taught here, They who are <hi>given, come to me</hi> ſaith he. 10. Such as really come to Chriſt, and embrace him, have not onely the preſent comfort of communion with him; but are warranted from this to gather their eternal election, and that they have been given over to Chriſt, and committed to his charge and care; Therefore is their <hi>coming</hi> put as an effect and evidence of their being <hi>given.</hi> 11. Such as are come to Chriſt, have warrant to expect wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and warme entertainment, whatever they have been before; for, ſo much doth the promiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, teach, which is made to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. And particular notice and care is taken of every one, as if there were no moe; And therefore, albeit the former ſpeech was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>all that the Father giveth,</hi> yet the promiſe is more particular, <hi>him that cometh, &amp;c.</hi> 12. Such as come to Chriſt, are put into a ſtate of much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and comfort, and may expect more from him then can be well conceived or expreſſed; for, albeit this promiſe be expreſſed onely in a negative, <hi>I will not caſt him out,</hi> yet it imports much more of his warme entertainment; and namely, that they are taken into his family; are brought neare him by reconciliation and friendſhip; have all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions reſpected by him; enjoy much of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, have him to be accountable for them, and to make all their lots, by his gracious providence, tend to their good. All things ſhall be theirs (and not they ſlaves to their idols) and Chriſt to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; Nothing ſhall diſcommend their perſon to him; Their condition ſhall plead rather for pity,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48148:60"/>
then wrath; Wants ſhall not render them unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but rather a conceit of fulneſſe; Under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and in performing duties, he ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, to work all their works in them and for them; And all of them ſhall finde the doore kept open, till they be entered in glory, without the reach of all their enemies, where they ſhall feede on the light of his countenance, ſhall follow and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, and be made like unto him. All this and much more is imported in this promiſe. 13. It is the great comfort of ſuch as come unto Chriſt, that as their allowances are rich, ſo their ſtate is ſafe and ſecure; And whatever their fears, miſtaks, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings, may be; yet they ſhall never be again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that happy condition; for, ſo much is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this promiſe, <hi>I will not caſt him out,</hi> that is, they are taken into that ſweet eſtate, not to be caſt out or rejected again. Saints do indeed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complaine of caſting off, but they are the words of ſenſe, and not of faith; They may ſeeme to be caſt off, when really it is not ſo; They may loſe degrees of fellowſhip for a time, but cannot be deprived of it totally, and for ever; They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſecluded from his favour and love, and an intereſt in him, though ſometime they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſome effects and manifeſtations, and fruits thereof; They may be deprived for a time of what contributes to their welbeing, but not of what is neceſſary for their being in grace; Yea, he will not permit them to caſt out themſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32, 40.14. Chriſts promiſes to theſe who come to him, are very ſure, and ſuch as (whatever doubts or je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies they may have, yet) he would have them on no tearmes to queſtion, eſpecially in what concerns his purpoſe not to reject them finally or totally; Therefore doth he ſo vehemently aſſert this, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> where the doubled nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, in the Original, ſerve to make the aſſertion ſtrong, and to carry their faith over all their doubts and feares.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt confirmes this promiſe, of entertaining them who come to him, by ſhewing the end of his Incarnation and coming into the world, and by rehearſing a part of his Commiſſion unto them. He declareth in general, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. that his errand into the world, is, to do his Fathers will who ſent him, and not his own. Which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that, as God, he hath a different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will to the Fathers, (though as man, he hath a diſtinct and ſubordinate will to his) but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, he came not to do his own will onely (as the Jewes alleadged of him) but the Fathers alſo, and that in this work, he was the Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, ſent to do what he had entruſted to him, and not, as the Jewes gave out, one who did that for which he had no warrant. Next, he declareth more particularly (<hi>verſe</hi> 39.) for confirmation of the promiſe, what this will of the Fathers is which he came to do; to wit, That theſe, that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, ſhould be preſerved from periſhing, and be raiſed up at the laſt day. This is again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>verſe</hi> 40. not onely for further certainty and comfort, but in the repetition, it is explained who they are that are given to him, even ſuch as ſee and beleeve in him; and what is the benefit they ſhall reap at the reſurrection, even everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt, in entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that come to him, is not onely led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by his own mercy and bounty, and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them as the reward of all his ſufferings; but doth alſo ſtand obliged thereunto, by vertue of a Commiſſion and truſt laid upon him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accepted and undertaken by him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he mention <hi>the will of him that ſent me,</hi> as a reaſon of his fidelity in this matter. 2. Chriſt hath given an ample proofe of his love, and pledge of his fidelity in his truſt, in his ſtooping to take on our nature, and aſſuming it in a perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf, on earth; for, ſaith he, <hi>I came down from heaven,</hi> of which, ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 33. And this he mentions here, not onely to ſhew how much it coſt him to exalt us; But to be a confirmation, and pledge of his tenderneſſe, and fidelity, in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſinners who come to him. For who can ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him who made himſelf like his brethren, (yet without ſinne) that he might be a fit High Prieſt? and to aſſure us that as he ſtooped to our low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to be humbled with us, ſo he would have us exalted with him. What aſſurance may it afford us, that he would come down from heaven, to dwell with us? that the beloved Sonne would make himſelf the But of all the wrath due to our ſinnes? that the ſovereign Lord of the creatures would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their oppoſition and enmity, that they might be friends to us? and, that he took on the form and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſervant, and continued ſo, till he had perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what concerned us? 3. Such as are employed in any ſtation by God, ought to have a conſtant look to the will of God, and the end ſet before them in that ſtation, that ſo they may aime at it; for, ſo doth Chriſts example teach, who looked <hi>to the will of him that ſent him,</hi> that he might do it. It is as ſure that Chriſt will warmly cheriſh them that come to him, as it is certaine he is faithful in his truſt; for, ſuch is the force of the confirmation, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out, for I came, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> If he do his Fathers will, as he ſtill doth, then ſuch
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48148:60"/>
ſhall not be caſt out. 5. The Fathers will and good pleaſure is the laſt and ultimate ground, that faith can ſeek to ſettle it ſelf upon; And particularly, it is ſufficient to anſwer all our reaſonings againſt Chriſts rich offers, that it is the Fathers will ſuch mercies ſhould be conferred; for, ſo is alſo imported here, that they have not onely Chriſts fidelity engaged to make them welcome, but it is the Fathers will they ſhould be accepted ſo, and that may ſilence all doubtings.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 39. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It doth commend the Goſpel to us, that it contains an Extract of the deep counſels of God, and of the eternal tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betwixt the Father and the Sonne, concerning, 1. Loſt man, in ſo farre as is for our good; for, he brings out and reads, in the Goſpel, his very Commiſſion, and ſome Articles of the Covenant paſt betwixt the Father and him. 2. The firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and riſe of the ſalvation of any of loſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; is in the abſolute and ſovereign will and pleaſure of God; for, here he mentions <hi>the will of him that ſent him,</hi> as the firſt Original of all, from whence their giving to Chriſt, their coming, and ſafety do flow. 3. Theſe whoſe ſalvation the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willeth, are given over to Chriſt in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe, to be brought to him in due time; for, ſo is here held out. 4 Such as are given to Chriſt by the Father, and do in time come to him, are put in his keeping, and he hath a charge of them, not to loſe any the leaſt of them; for, <hi>this is the will of him that ſent me, that of all he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> Wherein the Father doth ſo commit the truſt unto him, as he ſtill keeps them in his own hand alſo, <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. 5. Chriſts charge and care of theſe that are given to them, extends even to the very day of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, that there he may make a good account of them, when all perils and hazards are now over, and that he may not ſo much as loſe their duſt, but gather it together again, and raiſe it up in glory, to be a proof of his fidelity: for, ſaith he, <hi>I ſhould loſe nothing but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day,</hi> and ſo death and diſſolution proves no loſſe.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 40. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. It is a truth that needs much and often to be inculcate upon us, that all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantages and benefits come to us, and are to be had, onely in Chriſt, and that in him they are all very ſure; Therefore doth he againe repeat this doctrine, concerning what is to be had in him; and that they will ſurely get it, who come to him; About this truth we have naturally many doubts, and are averſe from ſubmitting to it; And when we cloſe with it, it begets love, it moderates all our cares and fears, and ſtrengtheneth us to endure all hardſhips. 2. However ſuch as flee to Chriſt in the ſenſe of their miſery, are prone to doubt of Gods will to accept them, rather then of anything elſe; yet it is out of all controverſie, that his will is to do good to ſuch; Therefore it is againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>this is the will of him that ſent me, &amp;c.</hi> to remove all doubts and fears. 3. Such as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, to be under his charge, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of his benefits, are drawn to beleeve on him; And it is the Fathers will, and a part of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action betwixt him and the Sonne, that faith be the way to partake of theſe benefits, and not the fulfilling of the impoſſible condition of the works of the Law: for, they who are <hi>given</hi> to Chriſt, are expounded to be they who <hi>beleeve on him,</hi> and it is the Fathers will, that ſuch partake of theſe benefits here mentioned, as of the reſt of his purchaſe. Albeit mortification, holineſſe, &amp;c. do prepare for the poſſeſſion of theſe benefits, and do evidence a right thereunto, and the begun poſſeſſion thereof; Yet it is onely faith in Chriſt that giveth the right and title, that ſo it may be of grace. 4. A ſpecial mean of begetting faith in Chriſt in men, is, to ſee and know him ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; to have him revealed unto them, and to get open eyes that they may ſee and contemplate him, till they ſee beauty in him, which may allure them to renounce themſelves and flee to him, and till they ſee fulneſſe and alſufficiency, to anſwer all their doubts: for, they <hi>ſee</hi> (or, <hi>contemplate) the Sonne,</hi> who <hi>beleeve on him.</hi> 5. It is covenanted betwixt the Father and the Sonne, that beleevers ſhall (beſide his tender dealing and care within time) be made partakers of everlaſting life; for, it is explained that not to <hi>loſe</hi> them, <hi>verſe</hi> 39. is, that they <hi>may have everlaſting life.</hi> 6. For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſuring of beleevers of their eternal happineſſe, it is alſo covenanted, that they ſhall have this life in preſent poſſeſſion, in the earneſt and firſt fruits thereof; for, they <hi>have everlaſting life,</hi> even here, and before their raiſing up. 7. Chriſt, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an earneſt-penny of ſalvation, will not ſuffer it to be loſt by any difficulty or impediment in the way; but will carry beleevers through all difficulties, till he deſtroy death and the grave, and raiſe up their very duſt, that in body and ſoul they may partake of that bliſſe, and that he may make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that death and rotting in the grave doth not make void his intereſt, nor cauſe his affection to ceaſe: Therefore it is added, <hi>and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> 8. Albeit beleevers are not all of one growth or ſize, but ſome are weak, and ſome ſtrong; ſome little children, ſome young men, and ſome fathers; Yet all of them, without exception, have right to the benefits conferred by Chriſt, and the weak, as well as the ſtrong, are under his care and charge; Yea, and may expect the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uſage from him who <hi>carrieth the lambs in his boſome, &amp;c.

The clearer Chriſt ſpeaks, they diſcover the more of their diſpoſition, and teſtifie their diſcontent of ſpirit, by murmuring. They paſſe over all that Chriſt had ſaid beſide, and do carp only at what he had ſaid in direct anſwer to their deſire, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. wherein he aſſerts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be that bread of life, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. which he had ſaid did come down from heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. This they carp at, that he, whom they ſuppoſed they knew to be but the Sonne of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould ſpeak ſo great things of himſelfe. Wherein they not only bewray their ignorance of his divine nature, and miraculous conception, but their groſſe errour, in alleadging that he was the Sonne of <hi>Joſeph. From ver.</hi> 41. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. Men may pretend to much affection and eſtimation of Chriſt, who yet will prove but inconſtant, ſeeing they proceed not on ſolide grounds; for, they who cryed him up, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. do now vilipend him, and carp that he ſhould commend himſelfe. 2. Such as do not get good of Chriſt and the Goſpel, nor do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him when he is offered, will certainly grow worſe; The powerful Goſpel will bring out their heart, and their unſoundneſſe will draw on more unſtreightneſſe; for, ſo fared it with them who ſought and heard Chriſt for a wrong end, the longer and the more they heare, they grow the worſe. 3. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee corrupt men, not only not embrace ſaving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but that they murmure and fret againſt it, and ſpit out their gall againſt the meſſengers thereof, either ſecretly or openly; for, ſuch is the entertainment Chriſt and his doctrine gets, <hi>The Jewes</hi> (as they were who followed and heard him) <hi>murmured at him,</hi> or, ſecretly muttered againſt what he ſaid. 4. Such as turn carpers and ſecret grudgers at the doctrine of Chriſt, do not only prove their preſent unſoundneſſe, but are on the way to further and more horrid apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; for, ſo doth the ſequel prove in theſe, this was the beginning of a breach betwixt him and them, which came at length to a greater height. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of apoſtacy would not be digeſted at firſt by many, but murmurings, grudgings, and miſtakes, do by little and little habituate them unto it. 5. Such as carp at Chriſts doctrine, and deny unto him the glory of his excellency, in his perſon and offices, do not only wrong him, but ingrately deſpiſe their own great mercy; for, this point which they murmured at; that he is <hi>the bread which came down from heaven,</hi> doth not only ſet forth his glory, but was moſt ſweet and comfortable to loſt ſinners, as holding out his rich offer, and his gracious condeſcendence and love, that he would ſtoop and come down, to give life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to them. 6. Though Chriſt had ſpoken much more then this, and that which concerned them very nearly, yet they take notice of no more but this one word. We may conceive the reaſons to be. 1. This having diſpleaſed them, it caſts down all the teſt; as oft times one word, croſſing carnal hearts, will irritate their corruptions, to reject all they heare, were it never ſo uſeful and inoffenſive, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.3, 6. with 9. 2. It may be conceived, that, however they underſtood, and did reſent the hard newes that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate againſt them, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. yet, they will not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel upon that, but upon a more plauſible ground: To ſhew, how ſubtile unfriends to Chriſt are, that can mask their diſcontent with faireſt colours, and not diſcover the bottome of their hearts. Or. 3. It may be conceived, that not only paſſion becauſe of what Chriſt ſaid, but their own conceit of themſelves, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from taking up that ſentence indirectly hinted at, and therefore Chriſt doth inculcate it again, <hi>ver.</hi> 44, 45. And ſo it teacheth, That, men who are puffed up with a conceit of themſelves, will not readily take with a reproofe or diſcovery of their condition, eſpecially if it be done but indirectly, and not held forth in expreſſe tearmes. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 7. When en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is made, it will be found, that it is not Chriſts doctrine, but mens own corruptions and miſtakes, that cauſe them to ſtumble; for, if they underſtood his meaning to be, that his very body deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as their following reaſoning doth import they did) this was but their own fancy; for, he ſpeaks of his Godhead and of the manner of his conception. And to deny his divinity and miraculous conception, was but their own ignorance of the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. and 9.6.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. Sinnes of progeniters may bring poſterity very low, and put even the poſterity of Kings into a mean condition; for, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſuppoſed father of Chriſt, and his mother, were both of the blood royal of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and yet they lived in a poor condition, which occaſioneth this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them with contempt. 2. It pleaſed our Lord not only to ſtoop and become man, but to be born of baſe and mean parentage; That ſo he might accompliſh prophecies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1. and 53.1. That he might ſhew, that his Kingdome is not of this world; might ſanctifie a mean condition to his own, and by his poverty make many rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. And, that, in Gods righteous judgement, reprobates might ſtumble at him; for, ſo was it with him here, his ſuppoſed father, and his mother, were in no great account at this time. 3. It is the diſpoſition and plague of hypocrites and belly-gods, that they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Chriſts outward baſe eſtate, and do not ſee his true and ſpiritual glory ſhining through that vaile; for, ſuch were they who ſee not the myſtery of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, nor the glory of his Godhead, but do ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on this, <hi>Is not this Jeſus the Sonne of</hi> Joſeph <hi>whoſe father and mother we know.</hi> 4. It is a great engine of Satan, to oppoſe Chriſt and his truth, by raiſing and ſpreading untruths, to bear him and it down; for, this was a grand cauſe of their ſtumbling, that they falſly ſuppoſed him to be <hi>the Sonne of Joſeph,</hi> which did obſcure the glory of his miraculous conception and birth. Thus alſo did Satan labour to bear him down by a general reproach caſt upon his countrey, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.46. and 7.52. Thus did he endeavour to obſcure his reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.13, 14, 15. And it is no wonder to ſee Chriſt and his truth ſuffer prejudice, by hereditary miſreports and calumnies in all ages. 5. Much outward familiarity with Chriſt and his ſervants, will readily breed contempt of him in carnal hearts; for, their knowing of him, his mother, and ſuppoſed father, makes them ſleight him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his miracles, <hi>is not this Jeſus, whoſe father and mother we know?</hi> 6.

And by this way of preaching, Chriſt would draw them from their idle debates, and would terrifie them, by letting them ſee that their unbeliefe proved they were lying, ſtill in nature, and that God had yet wrought no change upon them, but had leſt them to themſelves; And withal he would let them ſee their loſſe, who by not embracing him, were ſecluded from his care.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>learn.</hi> 1 Chriſt knowes and takes notice of moſt ſecret murmurings, and mutterings and repineings againſt God, his Word, or Servants, were they never ſo cloſly or handſomely conveighed; for, albeit, it ſeemes, they ſpake not out theſe things, but whiſpered them <hi>among themſelves,</hi> as the text hath it, and the word in the Original imports; yet Chriſt knoweth it, and tells them of it. 2. Murmurings, and repining againſt God, and divine truth, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pretence, are diſpleaſing to Chriſt, as being a cauſleſſe diſtemper, reflecting injuriouſly upon God; Therefore doth he prohibite it as a thing diſpleaſing to him, <hi>Murmure not among your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. What ever be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of murmures againſt Chriſt and his truth; yet the true cauſe thereof is in themſelves, and not in him nor in it; Therefore doth he lead them from that carping at his doctrine, to ſee their own natural diſpoſition, which bred ſuch a diſtemper. 2. Men, by rejecting Chriſt, and murmuring at his offers, do bewray ſo much of their own corrupt diſpoſitions, and that they are ſo far left to themſelves by God, as might be matter of horrour unto them, if their eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; for, this is the ſcope of this doctrine here, to let them ſee, not only that they are corrupt, but that God hath not wrought on them as he doth on theſe who are his elect, as <hi>ver.</hi> 37. that ſo he may let them ſee, what ſad things their condition ſpake to them. And Chriſt doth often recurre to this with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Jewes, not to make them ſit down upon this as an excuſe (which is not); But partly, to ſhew, that, however the Lords purpoſes concerning men be hid and ſecret; yet, by their own carriage they may bring out ſtrange evidences of it, and (however the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of any particular perſon, cannot be certainly known by any meer man, ſo long as the perſon is within time, yet) mens perverſe carriage doth prove a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate diſpoſition for preſent, and being preſerved in, is a black mark of their deplorable ſtate. And partly, to ſhew that Chriſt will not take an affront at the hand of any, but as they who love him, ſhall finde that they were firſt beloved of him; ſo they who reject him, and perſevere in it, will finde (to their eternal confuſion) that he did give them up to their own hearts, to walk in theſe wayes, in puniſhing whereof he will manifeſt the glory of his juſtice. 3. Albeit it be the duty of all who hear the Goſpel, to embrace Chriſt; and albeit it be juſtly commanded, to diſcover our inability, and as a mean which God maketh uſe of to work thereby upon his own: Yet no man hath naturally any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or power to receive Chriſt, or come in faith to him; But every man by nature, (whatever his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, education, or moral vertues, be) hath loſt all power to do any ſpiritual good by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and remains dead in ſinne; for, <hi>no man can come to me,</hi> ſaith he, to wit, of himſelfe, as is after cleared. 4. This natural impotency in man cannot be cured by meer moral ſwaſion, or holding out of the offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel; But with this, there muſt be a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful and effectual work of God, in changing and renewing of mens nature, infuſing of the habits of grace and faith, quickening them from their deadneſſe, and exciting of theſe graces which he infuſeth, and effectually inclining their heart and minde to embrace Chriſt, and cloſe with him, and adhere to him; for, this is the only remedy of mans impotency, that <hi>the Father draw him.</hi> To aſcribe unto God no more but moral ſwaſion in this work, is to allow him no more hand in good, then Satan hath in evil; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to aſcribe unto man as much praiſe of doing good, as he is reproveable for evil. And it aſcribes unto man the glory of making himſelfe to differ from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48148:62"/>
another, who had the ſame offer with him, but would not be perſwaded. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. 5. Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in curing and recovering of loſt men, hath not only to do with impotency, but with averſeneſſe, with a corrupt will, ſtrongly inclined to evil, and with corruptions, which will reſiſt and oppoſe him in his working; for, ſo much doth this <hi>drawing</hi> import 6. The powerful grace of God is invincible, and will effectuate his purpoſe over all impediments. He will not only bear down the reſiſtance and oppoſition that corruptions make, but he, who is Lord of the will, will ſweetly incline, and powerfully allure it, and make the man moſt willing to come to Chriſt; for, if <hi>none can come, except the Father draw him,</hi> then certainly they whom he draweth, do come, and ſo Chriſts promiſe ſubjoyned, and the following <hi>verſe</hi> do clear. 7. This <hi>drawing</hi> is aſcribed to <hi>the Father which hath ſent Chriſt,</hi> not ſecluding the reſt of the perſons, ſeeing every work of God which relateth to the creatures, is common to the whole bleſſed Trinitie, and Chriſt hath an hand in this ſame work, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. See <hi>Joh</hi> 12.32. Nor yet is this expreſſion only uſed to ſhew, that the Father is firſt in order of working this work, as he is firſt in order of ſubſiſtence. But it points out further. 1. That the father, who entred in a Covenant with the Sonne, and ſent him into the world to obey his will; and performe theſe duties he had voluntarily undertaken, is in a ſpecial manner obliged, by vertue of that paction, to bring unto his Sonne the promiſed ſeed and reward of his ſufferings. 2. It ſerveth to ſhew, that, however he be a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, and will have juſtice ſatisfied, for the ſinnes committed even by his elect; Yet, as the Sonne did voluntarily ſubmit to that diſpenſation, to pay the price, though he was alſo the party offended: So the Father doth alſo ſo love them, as he drawes them to Chriſt, that his juſtice may be ſatisfied in him, and that his love toward them may let forth it ſelfe in comfortable and ſenſible effects. And this will teach us, ſo to magnifie the tenderneſſe of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, as not to entertain wrong thoughts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 8. The great miſery of theſe who are not wrought upon to come to Chriſt, is clearly to be ſeen and read in the warme uſeage they meet with, who embrace him; Therefore doth Chriſt hold out his undertaking for them who are brought to him, that he may let theſe murmurers ſee their great loſſe. 9. Time will certainly come to an end, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and contentment which men imagine in the things of it, will have a period; for, dayes do, at laſt, come to <hi>the laſt day.</hi> 10. Whatever believers finde in Chriſt within time, yet their eyes are chiefly fixed upon eternity, and upon the expectation of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled happineſſe there; Therefore do they need to have a promiſe concerning <hi>the laſt day</hi> ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated unto them. 11. Such as are brought to Chriſt by the Father, he will never abandon them till he have raiſed them up at the laſt day, and preſented them blameleſſe and compleat before the Father, that they may forever be with him; for, ſaith he, <hi>and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt doth confirme his aſſertion, concerning the Fathers drawing, from the prophecies of the Old Teſtament which ſpeak of the dayes of the Goſpel; Wherein it is foretold, that all the Elect, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in the Spirit, ſhall be taught of God to embrace Chriſt offered in the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. Whence he inferreth, that every one who is thus taught, doth come and embrace him. This teaching is not to be underſtood as ſecluding a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſtry under the Goſpel; for, the very text includes <hi>hearing and learning;</hi> and this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould not only rub an imputation upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles practice, who in theſe very times of the Goſpel, did preach, and appoint a Miniſtry, and ordained Miniſters; and who did continue teach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing and exhorting, when yet they acknowledge this promiſe to be accompliſhed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 21, 27, 28. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9, 10. but it ſhould ſtrike alſo againſt all private mutual edification, as well as publick teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which yet the decriers of a Miniſtry will not allow; Yea, they intrude themſelves as Preachers, that they may cry down Preaching and a Miniſtry.

It is by the Scriptures, that all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and debates, in matters of Religion, muſt be decided; Therefore, doth he remit the proofe of his aſſertion to what, <hi>is written in the Prophets.</hi> 2. Not only Chriſts outward condition and practice, but his doctrine, are in all things aggreeable to the doctrine and predictions of the Old Teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah, and what ſhould be fulfilled in his wayes; Therefore doth he cite <hi>the Prophets,</hi> as foretelling the ſame things of the dayes of the Meſſiah, which he now aſſerts. And he who was truth it ſelfe, doth condeſcend to confirme his doctrine thus. 3. Gods way of drawing in ſinners to Chriſt, as it conſiſts not in bare moral ſwaſion, ſo neither is it a working upon men as inſenſible ſtocks or irrational creatures, but he deales with them in a rational way, and by his efficacious teaching, doth cure the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their minde, and open and encline their hearts; for, his <hi>drawing,</hi> ver. 44. is by this teaching, <hi>they ſhall be taught of God,</hi> to wit; in the uſe of means, yet ſo, as they finde God in them, as is before explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 4. It is the priviledge of all the Elect, that, in their own meaſure, they are taught by God; and how ſmall ſoever their knowledge be, yet they are taught what is neceſſary for bringing them to Chriſt, and made wiſe unto ſalvation, for, the promiſe is univerſal, as to them, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>

See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. And Chriſt doth cite it with the copulative, <hi>and,</hi> whereby it is joined in the Prophets with the other promiſed mercies, to lead us to the ſtudy of the rich and many mercies that do accompany it, and are given with it. 5. Such as are taught by God in the uſe of means, will not only get an ear to hear, but will not reſt on that, till they get an heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and learn by their hearing; for, they who are taught of God, are <hi>every man that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father.</hi> 6.

No light, nor illumination of the minde, nor any other change, will prove a man taught of God, unleſſe he be convinced of his own miſery, and of Chriſts mercy, and brought to cloſe with him, and daily to come unto him, and practice this leſſon of coming; for, this is the evidence of a man that hath <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> he <hi>cometh unto me.</hi>

                  <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> Chriſt clears the former teſtimony, and inference from it, by ſhewing that Gods teaching doth not import that men muſt firſt ſee God, and be taught of the Father apart, and without him; For not only is the Father inviſible to the eye of our body (which is alſo true of the Sonne and Spirit, ſave in ſo far as the Sonne of God was incarnate, and made manifeſt in the fleſh) but there is alſo no immediate ſight of the minde, or knowledge of the Father, in his eſſence, will, or wayes about ſaving of ſinners, but what Chriſt the Sonne hath; And therefore all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt be taught, not immediately by the Father, but mediately in and by him. And Chriſts ſcope in this, is, not only to cleare the miſtake that might ariſe, but to make way for returning to his former doctrine; by leading them to himſelfe, in whom, and by whom alone, they could expect any thing the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Men in hearing and ſtudying ſublime and divine truths, have need of much caution and warineſſe, that their carnal and ſhallow concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imaginations do not beget miſtakes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours about them, and withdraw them from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicity of what is revealed; Therefore doth Chriſt finde it needful to prevent miſtakes about this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2. Gods condeſcending to ſtoop to ſinners ſhould be entertained with due reverence, and ſhould not hide from us that diſtance that is betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and our baſeneſſe, nor hinder us to keep at due diſtance with him; Therefore, having ſpoken of his condeſcending to teach us, he guards that, by exalting the Father, and ſhewing that there is no immediate ſeeing or knowing of him. Hence it is that even that ſweet name, <hi>the Lord they God,</hi> is declared to be <hi>a glorious and fearful Name,</hi> Deut. 28.58. 3. Not only is the Father inviſible, but he doth not reveal himſelfe, or his will concerning the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners, immediately unto men; or, as Chriſt ſeeth and knoweth him and it; but is an incomprehenſible God, a light which no man can approach unto, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 16. for, ſaith he, <hi>not that any man hath ſeen the Father,</hi> to wit, immediately, or without Chriſt, and as Chriſt ſeeth him, as is after cleared. For albeit he did familiarly converſe with, and reveale himſelfe more immediately to ſome in reſpect of others, and particularly to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33.11. Numb. 12.8. Yet any bodily ſight he got, was but of his back parts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.23. and but <hi>the ſimilitude of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 12.8. or ſome external ſigne of his glorious preſence with him, and not a ſight of his eſſence, which only Chriſt doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſee and comprehend. And what he got reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, by his ſpeaking with him mouth to mouth, and face to face, it was only through and by Chriſt, (who is the revealer of the Father,) and far ſhort of that knowledge and ſight, and of the way of it, which Chriſt hath. See on <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. 4. Chriſt is of the Father another way then either Angels, or men, or Saints; to wit, neither by creation, nor regeneration or adoption, but by unſpeakable generation proper to himſelfe; Therefore it is aſcribed to him in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way, that <hi>he is of God.</hi> 5. This way of being of the Father, makes it Chriſts priviledge to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and immediately acquainted with him, and to be the teacher and revealer of the Father, to all that know him; for, <hi>he which is of God, he hath ſeen the Father,</hi> and this cleares that it is by him men are <hi>taught of God,</hi> ver. 45.

                  <p>Chriſt having digreſſed this far (being interrupted with their murmuring) to ſhew the cauſe of their diſtemper; He returnes now to inculcate and preſſe the former doctrine, taking occaſion from the former <hi>ver.</hi> wherein he hath ſpoken of his immediate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſeeing of the Father. And firſt, he gravely aſſerts and ſeals the truth of that doctrine which points out ſalvation to beleevers in him. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Chriſts immediate acquaintance with the Father, is forth-coming for beleevers good; Therefore, unto that doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. is this ſubjoyned, for their comfort. 2. Such as do know and take up Chriſt rightly, will ſee great cauſe of truſting him, and cloſing with him; So much alſo doth the dependance of this on the former <hi>ver.</hi> import, that they who take him up to be one who immediately ſeeth the Father, will finde ground to credite this doctrine, whatever they thought of it before. 3. This repetition, and preſſing this doctrine doth hold out how neceſſary theſe truths are. 1. That men be taken up with their own ſalvation, and the way of attaining it, as being the mean to drive away many idle and needleſſe janglings; Therefore doth he wave the anſwer to their ſophiſtry, and direct them how they may attaine <hi>everlaſting
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48148:63"/>
life.</hi> 2. It is neceſſary that men ſtudy much that eternal life is to be had only in and by Chriſt, and will certainly be attained ſo: This he again repeats here. 3. It is neceſſary, that all falſe wayes to heaven be cryed down, and that men look on faith as the only and ſure way of taking hold of Chriſt, and of getting life in him; for, to ſuch is the promiſe againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. 4. Men ſhould alſo ſtudy that this offer of life, is indefinite, and it will be undoubtedly granted to all who ſhall or will beleeve: for, it is indefinite, <hi>he that beleeveth,</hi> be what he will, or be they never ſo many. 5. It is alſo to be ſeriouſly ſtudied, that beleevers have eternal life in ſome reſpects, even here, to wit, in Chriſt, and by faith, in the earneſt penny and firſt fruits; for, <hi>he that beleeveth, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Doctrine</hi> 4. The confirmation of this doctrine, by a double aſſeveration, teacheth. 1. Men are by nature ſo addicted to the covenant of works, and ſo loath to be ſtripped of their own worth and righteouſneſſe, that they are hardly perſwaded that faith in Chriſt is the way to life, and very unwilling to embrace and reſt in it; for, this aſſeveration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that there is a controverſie in this matter, 2. Corrupt reaſon will never end this controverſie, but we muſt take us to Chriſts word alone, to ſatisfie us; Therefore he uſeth no diſpute, but aſſerteth it on his truth and word. 3. This truth (however contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verted) is moſt certain, and without all controverſie; for, it is <hi>verily, verily,</hi> true. 4. It is moſt needful, and profitable, that ſinners beleeve and cloſe with this truth, and make uſe of it; Therefore doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate and aſſert it. 5. Chriſt alloweth ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, to be very confident and perſwaded of his accepting of them, and of their eternal happineſſe; Therefore doth he ſtrongly aſſert that <hi>verily, verily,</hi> they <hi>have everlaſting life.</hi>

                  <p>Next, Chriſt repeats his former doctrine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the former aſſertion, by ſhewing that he is the bread of life.

Men by nature are ſoul-ſtarved, pineing away under the want of ſouls food, and not only ſo, but they are ſo dead, that they know or feele it not; for, that he is <hi>the bread of life;</hi> imports not only this their pineing condition, but their being dead under it. Otherwiſe, if they truely felt it, it were a ſigne of a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ſenſible of their worſt eſtate. 2. Chriſt is unto the needy ſoul all that it can need. He is, by way of excellency, the food of ſouls, which quickens them when they are dead, and refreſheth them, and preſerveth the life which he giveth; for, ſaith he <hi>I am that bread of life.</hi> 3. This excellent vertue in Chriſt, to give and preſerve life, is ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a beleever, that by cloſing with him, he ſhall have everlaſting life; Therefore is this ſubjoyned as a confirmation of the former aſſertion, in <hi>ver.</hi> 47.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt illuſtrates this quickening vertue of this bread, by comparing it again with Manna, which was but weak, and could not preſerve their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from death, <hi>ver.</hi> 49. whereas this bread, which came down from heaven, doth deliver and preſerve them from death who eat of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 50. This that is ſaid of Manna, that the fathers, who eat thereof, are dead, may be underſtood two wayes, and in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the oppoſition will ſtand firme betwixt it and this bread. 1. That though Manna was excellent and pure food, yet it could not ſo much as ſave their fathers from bodily death, but this ſaves the ſoul from ſpiritual death, is a remedy againſt bodily death, and a preſervative both of ſoul and body againſt everlaſting death. 2. That though their fathers did eat Manna, as it was ſpiritual meat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. and a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pointing out Chriſt, yet many of them periſhed eternally; but the partaker of this bread, is ſure of everlaſting life. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. A ſpecial way to finde out the excellency of Chriſt, is, to compare him with what ſeems to have any excellency in it, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>; for, to this end is he again compared with Manna. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that would came in compe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>loſed as a thing of naught; Therefore, albeit Manna in it ſelfe was an excellent gift of God, yet when they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed ſo much upon it, Chriſt findes it neceſſary to vilifie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thus. 3. It may leſſen our eſtimation of any outward thing, when we conſider that it cannot ſo much as perpetuate it ſelfe with us, or us with it, and far more, that it cannot prove a remedy againſt perdition; for, thus doth he abaſe Manna, <hi>your fathers did eat Manna in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and are dead.</hi> 4. Unbeleevers do partake only of the outward part of the Sacraments, and that is ſo far from ſaving them, that their abuſe thereof, tends to their perdition; for, thus alſo did they <hi>eat Manna,</hi> as it was a Sacrament, <hi>and are dead.</hi> 5. It doth ſet forth the excellency of our true ſpiritual food, that it cometh down from heaven, far above the clouds whence Manna came; and ſo is divine food, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Gods love and condeſcendence to loſt man; for, <hi>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven.</hi> 6. Chriſts coming down from heaven, and offering himſelfe in the Goſpel, is a ſufficient invitation, and ground for hungry ſinners, to come and feed upon him; for, it <hi>cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof.</hi> 7. Chriſt is ſuch ſpiritual food, as will prove a remedy and preſervative againſt death, both ſpiritual and eternal, and ſo ſwalloweth up any bitterneſſe that is in bodily death, for, this bread cometh from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</hi>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe,</hi> 1. Chriſt goeth on to ſhew the excellency of this bread which he had commended above Manna. And ſpeaking of himſelf in the firſt perſon, (whereas <hi>verſe</hi> 50. he had ſpoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the name of bread, in the third perſon) he declareth that he is that living bread, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker whereof ſhall live eternally in bliſſe with him. 2. He brings out yet more of his minde concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this true food, by ſhewing in what reſpect he is this food; to wit, by reaſon of his incarnation, and taking on our fleſh or nature, and by his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this a ranſome for ſin, whence flowes the purchaſe and application of life to his own of all Nations. So that the ſenſe of this is not, that his fleſh, eaten in a carnal way, by the mouth of the body, is this living bread, nor yet that his humanity ſeparate from his Godhead gives life; for both theſe conceits are afterward refuted. But the meaning is, that Chriſts Incarnation, and taking on our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as our kinſman, is a channel and conduit, through which the quickening vertue that is in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is commuicate unto us; and his offering up himſelf in that nature, by his eternal ſpirit, doth purchaſe and merit that this quickening vertue be actually applied and communicate, and his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is (as it were) the preparing of him to be fit meat to us.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt part of the <hi>verſe, Learn</hi> 1. It is a point to be much and often ſtudied, that onely Chriſt is the fountain and ſeeder of our ſpiritual life, leſt our hearts turne aſide to other confidences; Therefore, having ſpoken of this bread in the third perſon, he finds it neceſſary again to aſſert, <hi>I am the living bread, which came down from heaven.</hi> 2. It may confirme our faith, that Chriſt can give and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſpiritual life, when we conſider that he is not a dead creature, as Manna was, but himſelf a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, and fountain of life; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am the living bread, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Chriſt is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a remedy againſt death which came by ſinne, but he giveth to his owne a life of happineſſe, which laſts eternally; for, ſo is here declared, he that <hi>eats, ſhall live for ever,</hi> to wit, in glory; for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reprobates ſhall live for ever in hell. 4. Chriſt muſt be applied by faith, of all theſe who would finde his vertue; for, this bread muſt be <hi>eaten,</hi> and then the eater <hi>ſhall live.</hi> 5. As Chriſt is that (and much better) to the ſoul, that food is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo faith in applying him, hath ſome affinity with eating, as here it is expreſſed; for it is as needful to the ſoul, as eating is to the body; it muſt be the work of empty and longing ſouls, as eating is the work of hungry men; Chriſt muſt be received and united to us by faith, as meat is let down, to be turned into our ſubſtance, by eating; being thus received, he will refreſh and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſoul, as meat doth an hungry man; And, faith muſt be daily exerciſed, out of new ſenſe of want, as eating is daily renewed by reaſon of new appetite.</p>
                  <p>From the latter part of the <hi>verſe, Learn,</hi> 1. The whole world, without Chriſt, is dead in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and lying under the ſentence of death pronounced in the Law; for, ſo is here imported, in that he muſt come and <hi>give life.</hi> 2. The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy of this evil, and ranſome of loſt ſinners, is, the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the giving of his humane nature to ſuffer death; for, <hi>the bread is my fleſh, given for the life of the world,</hi> or, to purchaſe life to ſinners dead in ſin. In all ages of the world, even before his Incarnation, he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life to ſinners, becauſe of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had bound himſelf to take on our nature, and, in it, to ſatisfie juſtice, which now he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, And albeit Chriſt in his whole perſon be Mediatour, and the party engaged to ſatisfie juſtice; yet it was in his humane nature that he underwent the puniſhment, and his humane nature was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported therein, and his ſufferings had worth and merit, becauſe of the union of the humane nature with the Godhead in one perſon. 3. Chriſt is not onely the ranſome of loſt ſinners, but the giver thereof alſo: He not onely willingly offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuffer, but was Prieſt as well as ſacrifice; yea, and Altar alſo; for, ſaith he, <hi>I will give my fleſh.</hi> 4. Chriſt came in the world to give, and now hath given, his life for the world; that is, for his own in it, in all ages and Nations, who are in themſelves as bad as any in the world, and many of them, of all ranks; In theſe reſpects it is ſaid, <hi>I give my fleſh for the life of the world.</hi> 5. That ſame fleſh and humane nature of Chriſt, that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up a ranſome to juſtice, is alſo the bread of life, for ſouls to feed upon; for, <hi>the bread is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> It is Chriſts ſuffering and death, from whence our life floweth, and Chriſt crucified is the carcaſſe on which ſouls feed. And it is aſcribed to his <hi>fleſh;</hi> or, humane nature, (as his paying the ranſome is alſo aſcribed to it) becauſe, however the quickening vertue and efficacy flow from the Godhead, to which his fleſh is united; yet, it is by his Incarnation and ſuffering, that this becomes food to us. 6. As Chriſt muſt not onely be given a ranſome for our ſins, but alſo given and applied to us, to quicken and feed our ſouls; So Chriſt is the giver of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both wayes; He gave gimſelf to the Father, to purchaſe life to his own, when many of them were not in being, far leſſe beleevers; and he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf unto them for life, when they beleeve; for, both theſe are expreſſed here, <hi>The bread which I will give</hi> (to wit, by way of application) <hi>is my fleſh, which I will give</hi> (by way of ranſome) <hi>for the life of the world.</hi>

                  <p>This new point of light, which Chriſt brings forth to cleare the way of this ſpiritual feeding, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a further diſcovery of his hearers; who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his words carnally, did ſtumble at them, and <hi>ſtrive among themſelves</hi> about them, that is, they did in a fighting tumultuous way expreſſe their ſtumbling one to another, or, it ſeemes that ſome underſtood him aright, or gave him charity, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers took him up carnally, and ſtumbled, and ſo they fell to ſtrive. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Carnal misbeleevers do put a carnal ſenſe upon Chriſts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual words, and ſo do occaſion their own ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; for, this they ſtumble at, <hi>how can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> They underſtand it of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eating, and this they cannot endure, becauſe it is inhumane to eate mans fleſh, and his owne body could not be food, that way, to all the world, far leſſe could it give life.

There is a daily ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual feeding upon Chriſt by faith, neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as men muſt eat daily for preſervation of life; for, this is it which Chriſt preſſeth here in this Chapter and not (as ſome dreame) a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental eating of his body, far leſſe, an eating of his fleſh in a corporal manner in the Sacrament; for, 1. The Sacramental eating was not yet inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed, and therefore could not be here inculcate. 2. This eating is ſo neceſſary to ſalvation and life, as none can have life without it, and all live who get it, <hi>verſe</hi> 54. But neither of theſe can be ſaid of Sacramental eating; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inſtitute, they who were ſaved went to heaven without it; Yea, and after it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, many (and particularly children) have gone, and go to heaven, without it; and all are not ſaved who partake of it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 4. Men will never feed on Chriſt for ſalvation in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, unleſſe they look upon it as a matter of life and death; Therefore doth Chriſt ſo preſſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and that with a <hi>Verily, verily.</hi> 5. It is the application of whole Chriſt, as incarnate, and in his ſufferings, that brings life. And Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied, will prove compleat nouriſhment: Therefore, having ſpoken before onely of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> now he addes his blood, they muſt <hi>eate his fleſh and drink his blood:</hi> to ſhew, that they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him wholly, and that he will be compleat nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. 6. Such as do not make ſpiritual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of, nor feed upon Chriſt crucified, have no ſpiritual life or communion with God, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue dead in their ſins, and ſhall not partake of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life; for, <hi>except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> they are already dead irrecoverably, unleſſe they make uſe of this remedy.</p>

Albeit men do need bodily refreſhments, and (when they do not feed on Chriſt) will not want their own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Yet all theſe, in compariſon of Chriſt, are but vaine and empty; They are but deceitfull meat, meat that periſheth, the beſt of them are but husks, and afford but ſhaddowes of that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, refreſhment, ſtrength, and life, which he gives: So much doth this expreſſion, <hi>meat indeed, &amp;c.</hi> Import, that albeit, beſides bodily refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the lawfull contentment men may have in their outward enjoyments, they will alſo be putting other things in Chriſts roome; yet all theſe are not indeed what they ſeeme to be; when compared with him. 2. Whatever ſhaddow of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency or contentment men finde in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the reality thereof is to be found in Chriſt, and him onely; For, whatever they thought of meat and drink, all that, and much better, is to be found here, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> 3. This ſweetneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in Chriſt, ſhould allure needy ſoules to feed upon him; And Chriſts commending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for that end, ſheweth how well they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſo to do; Therefore doth he bring in this commendation, as a reaſon and encouragement to them to come, and an aſſurance that they ſhall finde life; <hi>for my fleſh is meat indeed, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>A ſecond motive to feed on him, and reaſon to prove that feeders have life, is taken from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that is betwixt Chriſt and feeders on him; That as meat is turned into the eaters ſubſtance, ſo they and Chriſt become one, and upon feeding, there followeth a mutual inhabitation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Union with Chriſt doth produce in ſouls a life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in grace here, and to be perfected in glory; for, Chriſt brings this indwelling, as an argument to prove that feeders have life. 2. Albeit ſuch as do but taſte of Chriſt and his goodneſſe, may ſpit out again what they have taſted; yet true feeders will abide in him, by conſtant dependance, and uniting themſelves to him, that they may have life, and feeding will make up this union; for, <hi>he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,</hi> feeding draweth him to abide more and more in Chriſt, and it makes up this union on the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers part. 3. As the true feeder is united to Chriſt, and abides in him, ſo Chriſt alſo doth abide in him, by conſtant influence and quickening vertue, to make him live, and ſo the inhabitation is mutual; for, <hi>he dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi>

                  <p>A third reaſon proving that feeders have life, and that life flowes from union with Chriſt, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Chriſts union with his Father, and his being ſent by him to do the office of a Mediatour. Wherein he declareth, that as the Father hath ſent him to be a Mediator and ſoul-feeder to beleevers, and as the Father who ſent him, liveth of himſelf, and he (the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon) liveth by the Father, ſo they who feed on him, ſhall live by him. Of this doctrine ſee, in part, on <hi>chap.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is a truth to be much preſſed, and wherein we have need to be well rooted, that life and ſpiritual well-being is to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48148:65"/>
be had onely in Chriſt embraced by faith, both as purchaſer and appliar; Therefore is this again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, <hi>he that eateth me, ſhall live by me.</hi> 2. Chriſt is ſuch a fountain of vertue and life, that even the dead may expect life by cloſing with him; for, life, or, <hi>to live by him,</hi> is promiſed to feeders. 3. Such is a beleevers intereſt in Chriſt, that whatever Chriſt hath, ſhall be forthcoming for him, as he needs it; for, ſo doth the argument run, that as he <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> ſo they <hi>ſhall live.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 14.19. 4. The Fathers ſending of Chriſt into the world, to be the Redeemer and Saviour of his people, is a ſure pledge that feeders on him ſhall live; ſeeing he will not fruſtrate the Fathers end, but will do the work he is ſent about; Therefore is this uſed as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>the Father hath ſent me, &amp;c.</hi> 5. As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath a fountain of life in himſelf, and the Son hath the ſame life communicate to him, with his eſſence, from the Father, and this dwelleth in the man Chriſt, by the perſonal union; ſo this life of the Father and Chriſt is a pledge that beleevers ſhall live; for, <hi>as the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo, he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Beleevers life muſt be ſure, for which there is ſuch a pledge, and that fulneſſe of the Godhead, and life, that dwels in the man Chriſt, cannot but put life, and preſerve life, in all that cloſe with him. Yea, Chriſts living by the Father is not onely a pledge of our life, but our life holds alſo ſome proportion or ſimilitude to his: For as he hath life communicate by eternal generation, ſo by regeneration we are made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. to wit, in reſpect of qualities; as he ſubſiſts in his life, as man, by vertue of the perſonal union with the Godhead; ſo, do we live by vertue of the myſtical inhabitation, or union with God, by his Spirit: And, as he as man had a created life here, and now lives gloriouſly at the Fathers right hand; ſo by the gracious operation of Gods Spirit, we ſhall be made conforme to Chriſt, and partake of the ſame life for kinde. 6. Albeit in our application of Chriſt, we muſt begin at his croſſe and death; yet his whole perſon is forthcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make beleevers live; Therefore, in place of his fleſh and blood, he ſpeaks generally, <hi>he ſhall live by me,</hi> pointing at his whole perſon.</p>

                  <p>In the concluſion of this diſcourſe, 1. Chriſt repeateth his former doctrine, pointing out his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency as bread of life, from his divine original; his excellency above Manna; and the effects of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him. 2. <hi>John</hi> deſignes the place where Chriſt preached his Sermon, which was their Synagogue at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> or the place where they of that City did aſſemble (as the word ſignifieth) for reading the Law, and ordinary moral worſhip. This ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Synagogues in the ſeveral places of the Land, hath beene of old appointed by God for the peoples edification, albeit they behoved to performe ceremonial worſhip in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.8. And the deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the place is recorded here, to ſhew that at this Chriſt cloſed his ſermon, and that what is after recorded, was onely occaſionall, and upon their removall, or after they were gone thence.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 58. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The blinde and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts of men are not eaſily brought to cloſe with ſaving truths, but either they do reject them, or do ſoone forget and let them ſlip; So much doth this inculcating of the commendation of this heavenly bread, import. 2. It is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that men do not halt nor heſitate in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cloſing with Chriſt, and feeding upon him; but that over all impediments, they take up their need of him, and make uſe of him accordingly; Therefore it is ſo much born upon them, again and again. 3. Miniſters muſt not be weary to preſſe ill learned truths, but their inculcating them is one mean to make them be received: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt tell the ſame things over again. 4. One main impediment unto the ſucceſſe of truth, is mens natural inclination to their old errours and principles, and their unwillingneſſe to quit them; for, ſo is here imported, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Manna which came from heaven, did ſo ſtick with them, that they could dreame of nothing ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and therefore he takes pains to refute this. 5. Chriſt being known in his true excellency and worth, both in reſpect of his Original, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which are conferred by him, will be found farre above any thing men doat on, and richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make them happy; Therefore is he held out here as <hi>come down from heaven,</hi> and making men to <hi>live for ever,</hi> neither of which could be ſaid of Manna, as hath already been cleared.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 59. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord brings a Nation into viſible Covenant with himſelf, it is his will, that care be had to keep up his worſhip, and to ſpread the knowledge of his name in all the corners of the Land; for, to this end did their many <hi>Synagogues</hi> tend. 2. It is the duty of Chriſts ſervants, to take hold of all occaſions within the compaſſe of their calling, to publiſh truth, and work upon ſouls: for, therefore did Chriſt teach <hi>in the Synagogue of Capernaum,</hi> that he might take occaſion to ſpeak to many when they conveened there. 3. However men diſreliſh Chriſts doctrine, yet it is truth, and ſo innocent and harmleſſe, that it needs not ſeek a corner, but may be avowed; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went publickly to <hi>the Synagogue</hi> with it. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.55. <hi>John</hi> 18.20. 4. Chriſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of places where he hath preached, and what means he ſends to ſuch and ſuch places; that as hereby he teſtifieth his reſpects, ſo their conviction may be greater, if they bring not forth anſwerable
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48148:65"/>
fruits; therefore is it recorded that this was done <hi>in Capernaum,</hi> where he often taught, but with ſmall fruit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23.</p>

It was not ſo indeed, but as they underſtood and took it carnally, and the blame was not in the doctrine, but in their corrupt taſte, which made what was ſweet, bitter to them. 4.

He declareth, that his aſcenſion into heaven ſhould prove the truth of that, to their conviction and ſhame. And this alſo helps to cleare their miſtake about eating of his fleſh. It doth not neceſſarily inferre that they ſhould be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his aſcenſion, but that he ſhould indeed aſcend, and that the truth and certainty of this ſhould ſhame them for their baſe thoughts of him likewiſe, while it is ſaid, he ſhall <hi>aſcend up where he was before,</hi> it is not to be underſtood, as it his Godhead did change place, and leave heaven at his incarnation; for, however he ſtooped, in reſpect of ſtate, to appeare on earth in our nature, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he is ſtill in heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. Nor is it the meaning, that his humane nature did deſcend from heaven, ſeeing in reſpect of that he aſcended. But the meaning is, that the aſcenſion of his humane nature, by local change of place, ſhould clearly prove that he came from heaven in reſpect of his divine natures ſtooping to be cloathed with our fleſh; And both theſe two are ſpoken of the whole perſon, in reſpect of the perſonal union, though they be verified but in the one or other nature. Further, it is to be marked, that Chriſts aſcenſion doth prove his Godhead, and that he came down from heaven; to wit, not ſimply, for <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> did aſcend to heaven, who yet were not there before; but in regard that he did ariſe and aſcend by his own power, <hi>Job.</hi> 2.19. and 10.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1.

Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven, in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, is a ſufficient refutation of all carnal conceptions of partaking of Chriſt, or of eating his fleſh: Therefore alſo doth he bring in this when they ſtumbled at eating of his fleſh, to ſhew that his aſcenſion into heaven might refute all ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, Chriſt cleares that which chiefly offended them, concerning his fleſh and the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, and the eating thereof. This he cleares in two aſſertions. 1. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> This may be underſtood as a clearing of what he ſaid concerning the eating of his fleſh, that it was not a carnal fleſhly eating of him that could profit anything, but it is a ſpiritual eating of him by faith, that bringeth that quickening and life of which he hath ſpoken. But it ſeemeth rather to clear what he had ſaid concerning the quickening po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his fleſh and humane nature, and by <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> we are to underſtand here his divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. And ſo the meaning is, that however much had been ſpoken of life to be given by partaking of his fleſh, yet this is not to be underſtood of his fleſh conſidered by it ſelfe and without his Godhead, as they conceived him to be a meer man: but all the quickening vertue that is aſcribed to his fleſh, or humane nature, doth flow from his Godhead to which it is united, And this alſo doth condemne their conceit of bodily eating his fleſh, ſeeing a Spirit, without which the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, cannot be eaten. 2. The ſecond aſſertion is, <hi>the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life.</hi> Wherein Chriſt directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes their ſtumbling at what he ſpake of eating his fleſh, which they underſtood in a carnal ſenſe; of eating with the mouth of the body. He declares that theſe words are not to be taken in a carnal groſſe ſenſe, but in a ſpiritual way, and being ſo taken, and Chriſt ſpiritually laid hold upon, the doctrine will not be found hard, but very refreſhful, and to contain that which brings life to the weary ſoul. And ſo <hi>the Spirit,</hi> is taken for what is ſpiritual, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſts fleſh and humane nature was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it ſelfe, and have quickening vertue to merit, communicate, and preſerve life in beleevers; Yet the Godhead is the fountain from which all this floweth, and that which giveth merit and efficacy to all his ſufferings and obedience; for, <hi>it is the Spirit that quickeneth.</hi> 2. Such as do not look on Chriſts fleſh, as the fleſh and blood of the Sonne of God, nor do lay hold on him by faith as God incarnate, that they may attain life: But do look on him as meer man, or as one whoſe fleſh is to be eaten in a bodily man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; They will never finde that quickening vertue in and from him, which he declares to be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for, <hi>the fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> to wit, in this reſpect. It is true, as God incarnate, his fleſh is the very price of life, the firſt receptacle of our ſpiritual life, and (being laid hold on by faith) the conduit to conveigh life to us. But being conſidered as a meer man, and his fleſh to be eaten bodily (as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> did) in that reſpect it profiteth nothing; for, no meer man can give life, nor merit it to loſt ſinners, and outward bodily feeding cannot be refreſhment nor food to ſouls. 3. Scripture is the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary to it ſelfe, in regard what is ſpoken more darkly in one place, is cleared in another; for, ſo doth Chriſt expound <hi>the words he ſpake.</hi> 4. What Chriſt hath formerly ſpoken of eating his fleſh, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſpiritually, of eating by faith, and not of bodily eating; for, ſo doth Chriſt declare; <hi>The
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48148:66"/>
words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit.</hi> 5. None but they who underſtand Chriſts words ſpiritually, will finde them lively in operation; for, being <hi>Spirit,</hi> or taken ſpiritually, then <hi>they are life,</hi> and then only. 6. The doctrine of the Goſpel, pointing out ſalvation by faith in Chriſt crucified for ſinners, is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a doctrine of a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the inſtrument and mean whereby the Spirit worketh and communicates himſelfe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. and tends to make us ſpiritual.

Such as do not underſtand Chriſts doctrine ſpiritually, nor do finde it ſpirit and life in operation, they have their own unbeliefe to blame for it; Therefore doth he aſſigne that as the cauſe of all their diſtemper, <hi>there are of you that beleeve not.</hi> This darkens the underſtanding, and deads the heart alſo. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2, 3. 3. Chriſt would have his ſervants very tender and careful, that in diſcovering of faults among hearers, they do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any who are innocent, nor any who have a deſire to be healed: So much doth his own practice teach, in that though they were many who were wrong here, yet he propounds the reproofe very gently, <hi>there are ſome of you, &amp;c.</hi> not only to intimate that ſome were free, but to guard againſt the deterring of all, by a general rebuke. 4. Chriſts reproofes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions from his Word, ſhould be looked upon as flowing from good grounds and certain knowledge, beyond any that the creature hath, or can attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> vindicate this ſeeming hard cenſure of Chriſts, from the imputation of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; by ſhewing, that <hi>Jeſus knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c.</hi> 5.

As there are many of theſe who do heare the Goſpel, who neither do nor will beleeve on Chriſt, and ſome who will turne treache<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous enemies; So Chriſt is not ſurprized thereby, but doth perfectly foreknow what men will prove; for, <hi>he knew from the beginning</hi> all this as being God, to whom all things are known from everlaſting. 7. As there may be, and of-times are, very corrupt men in Chriſts company, and among the viſible ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people; So it is his will that men be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to continue therein, ſo long as they profeſſe external ſubjection, without making enquiry into their ſpiritual eſtate: Therefore Chriſt, when he judgeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt hath very grave and important reaſons for what he ſaith, though we oft-times do not ſee them; So much doth he make known concerning his former doctrine, though they had little conſidered it, <hi>He ſaid, Therefore ſaid I unto you, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Albeit hearers be oft-times ſo ſtupid and blinded with ſelfe-love, that they never lay doctrine to heart, unleſſe it be ſaid, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> (as we ſee even in <hi>David.</hi>) Yet it is the duty of all ſo to hear, as they make particular application of what is heard, for, ſo much doth Chriſt point at, while he tells that what he ſpake in general, was with an eye to them. 3. It is a truth to be much and frequently ſtudied, that men are naturally impotent of themſelves to come to Chriſt, and that they have rather cauſe to mourn under the ſenſe of this, when they cloſe not with Chriſts doctrine, then to quarrel him: Therefore doth Chriſt repeat this doctrine over again. 4.

As there are times of viſible flocking unto Chriſt, ſo there are times of trial, wherein there will be as great ſcattering and Apoſtacy from profeſſions; for, ſo are we here taught, that <hi>many went back,</hi> and (as it ſhould ſeem, comparing, <hi>ver.</hi> 67) all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but the twelve. 2. Chriſts doctrine is a touchſtone of true profeſſion, and ſuch as do not profit by his preaching, nor grow better by his reproofes or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of their evils, and the remedies thereof, will ſtill grow worſe, till they make open apoſtacy; for, it was <hi>from that time</hi> they <hi>went back,</hi> that is, after he had preached himſelfe unto them, and had diſcovered that the true cauſe of their murmuring was only in themſelves, and that this could be remedied only by God. 3. Albeit ſuch as have in ſincerity given up their names to Chriſt, will neither totally nor finally fall away; Yet not only may they make a foul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for a time, and in part, but viſible profeſſours may totally fall away; for, <hi>Many of his diſciples went back.</hi> &amp;c. That is many unſound profeſſours did altogether renounce him, and albeit, it may be, ſome did again recover their feet, yet no mention is made of it here. 4. Mens former profeſſions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Chriſt and his truth, will aggravate their Apoſtacy, and adde to the ſinne thereof; Therefore alſo it is marked that they were <hi>diſciples</hi> who <hi>went back.</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. and 4.15. 5. Albeit unſound profeſſours ſeem to caſt the world, and their old faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, behinde their back, for a while; yet their heart is not really weaned from them, nor are they really caſt out; And when tentation cometh, and they finde not that in Chriſt which they expected, they will turne back to their old vomit again; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, they <hi>went back,</hi> or, <hi>to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them.</hi> So dangerous is it for profeſſours, to have Satan gone out, and not caſt out. <hi>Luk</hi> 11.24. to have any thing wherein to delight beſide Chriſt, when they cloſe with him; or, to have theſe things which they ſeemed formerly to ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As it is the duty of all profeſſours, to hold communion with Chriſt; and converſe with him, and publickly to own him in the midſt of a perverſe generation (without which greateſt pretences of ſecret friendſhip is of no availe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43.) So, when men do quit this practice, and do not wait upon the ordinances as they were wont, it is an undeniable ſigne of woful Apoſtacy, whatever they pretend to; for, it is the proofe of their Apoſtacy, <hi>they walked no more with him,</hi> nor did publickly own him, nor wait upon his Miniſtry.</p>

                  <p>Upon this ſad event and defection of many, Chriſt confirmes his twelve Apoſtles, and yet warnes them, that all who were unſound, had not gone away at this defection. The way of confirming them, is by a queſtion, poſing them concerning their reſolution, which drawes out an ample confeſſion and Teſtimony of <hi>Peter,</hi> in name of the reſt. From Chriſts queſtion in this, <hi>ver. learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is not much troubled, though never ſo many of the rotten croud do deſert him; Therefore he never ſpeaks a word to them, but only to the twelve. 2. When many are making defection, it may ſo ſhake even the ſoundeſt, that they will need warning and confirmation: Therefore doth he put them to it, if they <hi>alſo</hi> would <hi>go away.</hi> Even the godly have feeds of the ſame evils which draw others away; evil example is very forcible, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is general; and ſinne is very infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially when it is carried on with plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts. And therefore it is no wonder if men be in hazard in ſuch a caſe: And, backſliders are (beſide their own defection) guilty of weakning the hands of others. 3. Albeit Chriſt ſtand not in need of any followers, nor needs he be anxious, though all ſhould forſake him; yet he will take pains to confirme and keep ſuch as are his own; Therefore doth he deale with <hi>the twelve.</hi> 4. The nearer Chriſts relations be to any, and the more proofes of love they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he will take it the worſe, to be forſaken by them: And this ſhould be a mean to keep ſuch from defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>will ye alſo go away?</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that their departure would touch him more then what all the reſt had done, and therefore they ſhould guard againſt it. 5. Whatever reſpect Chriſt have to any of his people, yet he will detain none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their will, but will have them a willing people who follow him; for this cauſe it is, that he puts it to themſelves, <hi>will ye go away?</hi> to intimate, that he will not accept of them (though no moe were left) except they be willing. Which yet is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if he left it ſimply arbitrary to them, to do as they liſted in it. But his ſpeech inſinuates a reproofe of them that went away, and therefore warns them to take heed they do not follow them. It is alſo a mean which he ſanctifieth unto them, and ties them faſter, while he ſeems to caſt the rains looſe. And withal, he who requires willing ſervice, doth give to his own, to be willing.</p>

By a contrary queſtion, he profeſſeth their conſtancy, and that they knew none beſide, to whom they could or would go, and therefore would adhere to him. 2. He gives reaſons for this his aſſertion, taken from Chriſts ſweet and precious doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 68. and from their faith and aſſurance concerning his offices and perſon, that he is the true Meſſiah, the Sonne of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 69.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 68. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Were they never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who make defection from Chriſt, and think little of his company, yet there will ſtill ſome be found of another ſtamp; as here we ſee in <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. Men may be of a more forward and ready ſpirit, in ſome outward actings for Chriſt, then others, who yet are as honeſt as they; Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> appeares with the firſt, not becauſe he was the eldeſt profeſſour, for <hi>Andrew</hi> was called before him, nor yet becauſe he had more faith and love to Chriſt then the reſt, for we may conceive that (at leaſt) the beloved diſciple came not behind with him; But it flowed from his forward ſpirit and temper, which as ſometime it made him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in good, ſo at other times it drave him as far wrong, that he might be humbled. 3. As hypocrites may lurk for a time undiſcerned by others, even in ſhaking times; So true grace makes men charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of others, ſo long as they bewray not their unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by viſible effects: And it is a ſweet compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gracious forwardneſſe and zeal, to be charitable, and not when men are rigide cenſurers of others; Therefore forward <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers in name of all, <hi>(we,)</hi> not ſecluding <hi>Judas.</hi> And however his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was miſtaken, yet he could judge no otherwiſe of him, ſeeing he ſtayed ſtill when the reſt went away. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. 4. Man ſince the fall is ſo empty and poore a creature, that he muſt have ſomewhat without him, to delight and reſt in for happineſſe; and if he do not chooſe Chriſt, he will put ſome other thing in his place: for, <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion imports, that if they went away from Chriſt, they behooved to go to ſome other, <hi>to whom ſhall we go?</hi> 5. Such as have a minde to quit Chriſt, had need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider firſt where they will get a better Maſter, and that change when they will, they will ſurely change for the worſe; for, <hi>to whom ſhall we go?</hi> ſaith he, as never looking for ſuch entertainment any where, as they had with him. 6. True diſciples, and ſuch as know Chriſts ſingular excellency, will not endure to hear of any ſeparation from him; for, this queſtion imports his abhorrence of going away from ſuch a Lord to any other. And all they who would cloſe and walk with him ſincerely, ſhould ſtudy and learn to know him to be the chiefe and moſt excellent of choices. 7 Such as would ſtand faſt in times of defection, ſhould have frequent thoughts of eternity, and of the life that is laid up there for ſuch as are ſincere; Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> fixes his eye on <hi>eternal life,</hi> and where that may be found which leads to it, when he is about the choice of a Maſter. 8. The doctrine of Chriſt and of the Goſpel is the only doctrine of eternal life; It not only manifeſts and brings to light, that there is an eternal life, and makes offer of it, but it points out the only right purchaſe of it, and way to it; It is the mean of regeneration and begetting of faith, and being embraced, doth give a right unto eternal life, and the firſt fruits of it, till they come to full poſſeſſion; Therefore is his doctrine called <hi>the words of eternal life.</hi> And in all theſe reſpects, it is preferred above the doctrine of all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and in moſt of them, not only above the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine of theſe times wherein Chriſt lived, but even above the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it is conſidered in oppoſition to him, or without him. 9. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the verdict that corrupt men give of Chriſts doctrine; yet ſincere diſciples will judge of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is, and as he accounts of it; for, what others accounted <hi>an hard ſaying, ver</hi> 60 <hi>Peter</hi> reckons to be <hi>words of eternal life,</hi> according to Chriſts own verdict, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. 10. Such as are ſeriouſly minding eternal life, will cleave to the true doctrine that leades to it, and will not abandon it nor the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof, no not in times of greateſt defection; for, it is one reaſon why they will not leave him, not only becauſe he is the Meſſiah, but he <hi>hath the words of eternal life.</hi> 11. It is Chriſts ſpecial prerogative, and the reaſon of ſincere profeſſours their cleaving to him, that he hath the words of eternal life in a peculiar manner; Being not only the diſpenſer and Miniſter thereof in the dayes of his fleſh, and that in a way of authority, ſweetneſſe, and efficacy, proper to himſelfe; But being alſo the purchaſer of theſe glad tydings; and being he who gives commiſſion to all that preach them, and he who gives efficacy thereunto, to make them the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, <hi>Peter,</hi> in all their names, profeſſeth that they do cleave to him, as he who, in all theſe reſpects, <hi>hath the words of eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 69. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of ſincere profeſſours, as to cleave to all truth, ſo in particular, to avow all the truths contraverted in the time, of what importance ſoever they be; Therefore doth <hi>Peter,</hi> beſide the excellency of Chriſts doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him alſo in his perſon and office, which were the truths then oppoſed, and though they be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths, yet were accounted but little by the oppoſers thereof. 2. The more men know of Chriſt, they will finde the moe bands to tie them to him, and the moe preſervatives againſt defection from him; And particularly, the true knowledge of his office and perſon may invite men to cleave to him, forſake him who will. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſubjoynes this as a new argument. 3. It is not bare and naked knowledge of what Chriſt is, that will tie mens hearts to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they embrace what they know, by faith; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> gives it as a reaſon of his conſtancy, <hi>we beleeve that thou art that Chriſt.</hi> And albeit this ſeeme to be nothing but an hiſtorical aſſent to what the devils do confeſſe; Yet as it is joined with <hi>Peters</hi> reſolution, <hi>to whom ſhall we go?</hi> as the ground of it, it is an act of ſaving faith, for a firme faith of the perſon and office of Chriſt, with adherence unto him and recombency on him, is the exerciſe of ſaving faith. 4. It is not reaſon that can take up the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries concerning Chriſts perſon, incarnation, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48148:68"/>
offices, but faith muſt cloſe with them upon divine revelation; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>we beleeve</hi> this. 5. As true faith and ſaving knowledge go together; So the knowledge which is gathered by experience and obſervation of events according to the Word, is a great help to faith; for, ſaith he, <hi>we beleeve and have known,</hi> as it is in the Original. As there is a <hi>ſeeing,</hi> or knowledge, that goeth before and with faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. (for albeit many things revealed be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves myſteries, and above the reach of our capacity, as to the nature, reaſon, and manner of them, yet faith knoweth that theſe things are, and ſo cloſeth with them:) So this is an experimental knowledge follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on faith; wherein, by conſidering the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of prophecies concerning the Meſſiah, in his perſon, they were experimentally confirmed in what they beleeved. 6. It ought, and will endeare Chriſt to all true diſciples, and make them cleave to him, that he is the only true Meſſiah promiſed to the fathers, who is appointed by the Father to exerciſe the office of a King, Prieſt, and Prophet, to his Church, and who is anointed with the Spirit above meaſure for that end, from whom his people may expect the fruits of all theſe offices, the participation of his fulneſſe, and Communion with him in his dignity: for, this is a reaſon of <hi>Peters</hi> reſolution, <hi>thou art that Chriſt,</hi> that promiſed Meſſiah, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed one. 7. It doth further heighten the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt in the hearts of beleevers, and is a ſtrong bar againſt defection from him, that he is the Sonne of the living God, by eternal generation, and communication of the ſame eſſence; And ſo he is the only excellent choice, is able for all his offices, and to give worth unto his ſufferings; And as he hath a fountain of life communicate from the Father, ſo he is able to beget and preſerve life in his people. All this is imported in that other reaſon, <hi>thou art the Son of the living God.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt, having drawen out this confeſſion, doth correct <hi>Peters</hi> charity, and warne them of a yet ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der defection, of one of them twelve whom he had choſen to be Apoſtles. Unto which <hi>John</hi> ſubjoins a declaration, ſhewing who it was that Chriſt ſpake of. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. In times wherein men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare very forward and reſolute, when others are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, Chriſt alloweth them not to be ſecure, but would have them warned and ſenſible of the hazard of more and worſe defection; Therefore, when a few of many have now ſtood, Chriſt ſeeth it fit to tell them they were not all ſound. 2. Albeit Chriſt do approve of mens charitable judgement of others; yet that judgement is not ſtill according to veritie, nor to be built upon by hypocrites; Therefore, albeit Chriſt do not reprove <hi>Peters</hi> charity, yet he ſheweth that it is miſtaken of one in the number. 3. Very general Apoſtacies, reducing ſincere profeſſours to a ſmall number, will not alwayes ſeparate all the chaffe from the wheat; But when multitudes make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and only a very few do ſtand, there may be yet hypocrites and traitors, even among theſe; for, <hi>Judas</hi> went not yet away with the ſtreame of this defection, becauſe he kept the bag yet, and his tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not yet come. 4. As there is no ſocietie in the earth ſo holy, but it is poſſible ſome of them may be wicked; Yea, and they may have an eminent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual calling and office in the Church, who yet are but wicked hypocrites, and will totally and finally fall away and betray Chriſt; So the eminency of mens office and employment renders their defection the more odious: And particularly, Apoſtacy is very odious in Miniſters; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, partly, he inſinuates that their election to an office, was no ground to build upon, that they were all ſound; And partly, he aggravates his defection from this, and therefore puts it to be conſidered by them, by this queſtion. It is not needful to enquire why Chriſt made choice only of twelve, and would have that number filled up, when <hi>Judas</hi> went to his place, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22, &amp;c. It ſufficeth us, that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh ſprang from twelve Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, ſo he would have his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſpirit, collected and brought to him, by twelve Apoſtles. 5. Such as, being entruſted by Chriſt, do not only make Apoſtacy, but turn perſecutors and traitors to him, are not only adverſaries to him, as Satan is, but do reſemble the devil, (who is a liar and murderer,) in crueltie under pretext of friendſhip; are acted and poſſeſſed by him; and, are odious unto God, as he is; Therefore the traitour gets this name, <hi>one of you is a devil,</hi> becauſe he <hi>ſhould betray him.</hi> Which is far different from what he ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he called him <hi>Satan,</hi> Matth. 16.23. for it was only a fit of tentation in him, wherein Satan abuſed his corruption and tongue for the time, but Satan had a dwelling and dominion in <hi>Judas.</hi> 6. How cloſly ſoever hypocrites and traitours carry themſelves among Gods people, yet they will not deceive Chriſt; but he knoweth them well enough, though all ſhould give them charitie; for, ſo much doth he declare here. 7. Albeit Chriſt, when he warnes the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people, would have all to trie and watch over themſelves; Yet ſuch as are ſincere, ſhould have no thoughts that he is ſuſpitious of them, or doth not approve of them: for, both theſe appeare here; he warnes them in general of the unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one, not naming him; not only becauſe he would let him diſcover himſelfe, and would not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that work wherein he was to be an inſtrument; but that they might all ſearch themſelves; And yet <hi>John</hi> names him particularly, and for what cauſe Chriſt ſpake ſo of him; and this he did, not only to free another Apoſtle called <hi>Judas</hi> alſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.16. (and therefore he deſcribes the traitour from his parentage, and from his country, <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> or, a man of that city <hi>Reioth,</hi> Joſh. 15.25. or, as ſome take it to

Whatever may be the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men concerning Chriſts proceedings; yet he hath wiſe reaſons, which may and will juſtifie them all; for, whereas it ſhould ſeeme that he ſhould rather have converſed where the learned <hi>Rabbi's</hi> were, then among the ſimple <hi>Galileans,</hi> and his remaining in corners might give men occaſion to ſuſpect the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his proceedings; yet the reaſon he giveth being conſidered, doth ſufficiently evince that he had juſt cauſe for what he did. 3. A violent death is the leaſt that Chriſt and his faithful ſervants may expect, for their good offices to a wicked world, if it were not prevented; for, <hi>the Jewes</hi> (or, men of <hi>Judea,</hi> and eſpecially their Rulers) <hi>ſought to kill him.</hi> 4. The rancour and malice of wicked men againſt Chriſt, is ſo inveterate, that no length of time will mitigate or allay their fury; for, although that work was long ſince done, yet they ſtill <hi>ſought to kill him.</hi> 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſt will not take away his preſence and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances from a people, becauſe of every ſinne, but doth rather offer himſelfe to ſinners, as a Phyſician to the diſeaſed; Yet cruelty and perſecution is a juſt cauſe, and forerunner of his departure: And faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may for a time, withdraw themſelves, being threatned with perſonal hazard, if they may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently get it done. Both theſe are imported in this reſolution, <hi>he would not walk in Jury, becauſe the Jews ſought to kill him.</hi> 6. Albeit Chriſts ſervants may warrantably, in ſome caſes, withdraw from perſonal danger; yet they would beware of diſhonouring God, by doing it out of ſlaviſh feare, or in a timerous way, but would uſe that mean of ſelfe preſervation, as a dutie commanded; for, ſo much doth his own practice teach, of whom it is not ſaid, <hi>he durſt not,</hi> but <hi>he would not walk in Jury,</hi> becauſe he was cammanded to preſerve himſelfe till his hour came. 7. Albeit Chriſt knew that his hour was not come, and ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not feare them, though he were in the midſt of them; yea, being God, he could reſtrain them, or rid himſelfe out of all their hands, as oft-times he did: Yet it pleaſed him to uſe this mean, of retirement and withdrawing of himſelfe, for his own preſervation; Not only, that, as ſometime he proved himſelfe God, by miraculous preſerving of himſelfe; ſo, he might alſo temper theſe manifeſtations, that they might not be kept back from doing that which he came into the world to ſuffer; But further alſo; that he might give proofe of his deep humiliation and abaſement, for our ſake; that he might, in his own perſon, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch a lot to his people; and, that he might teach them to expect Gods providence about them, for their preſervation, in the uſe of lawful means. 8. As Chriſt and his ſervants will not want employment in ſome places of the world, however they be entreated in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; So albeit they may be ſecluded from many places and parts of their calling, yet they have no warrant to be idle, but ought ſtill to be doing good, as they may; Therefore, albeit he ſtayed in <hi>Galilee,</hi> yet he did not lurk there, but <hi>walked in Galilee,</hi> or, went about from place to place, preaching and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, as was his way, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. 9. Chriſt is not only tender to ſuch as come to him, but will alſo be at pains to ſeek them who have need of him, to do them good; for, he <hi>walked in Galilee,</hi> he ſtayed not in one place, that any who had need, might come to him, but he walked about, to ſeek them.</p>

                  <p>Followeth the ſecond part of the Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt refuſeth to go up in his brethrens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the feaſt of Tabernacles. Their deſire is contained in theſe verſes, to which Chriſt returnes his anſwer in the following purpoſe. In theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes conſider, 1. The occaſion which induced them to make this propoſition, (which alſo points at the time of his continuance in <hi>Galilee) verſe</hi> 2. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the feaſt of Tabernacles was now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which was one of their three yearly ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.34. wherein (beſide other perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, common to it with other feaſts) they went out of their houſes and dwelt in booths made of boughs of trees: Not onely to be a type of Chriſts Incarnation and dwelling in our fleſh, but to keep them in remembrance of their preſervation in tents in the wilderneſſe, before they came to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed land. 2. Their deſire, that he would <hi>depart hence, and go up to Judea, and ſhew himſelf to the world:</hi> The meaning whereof is not, that they would be rid of him, or caſt him in his enemies hands, but they could not endure that their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould lurk in ſo baſe a place, and not go to <hi>Judea,</hi> where he might get more credit, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they thought to ſhare. And therefore they deſire that he would go up with them to this ſolemne feaſt, and ſo Chriſt himſelf expounds their deſire, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and ſo was the cuſtome, that kinſmen went up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to theſe feaſts, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.44. 3. The motives they uſe to induce him to hearken to their deſire, are two; In one of them, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. they pretend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the diſciples which he had gathered in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea (chap.</hi> 3 22, 26. and 4.1.) who, as they inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and pretend, were ſleighted and expoſed to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, through his long abſence, and theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he wrought in corners might contribute much to ſtrengthen them. In the other, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more of their ambitious intentions; They think it unhandſome for a man of ſo eminent gifts to lurk in corners, nor can they underſtand what could be his aime, if it were not to riſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eminent by his gifts; and therefore would have him caſting himſelf where he might get beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being taken notice of. 4. <hi>John</hi> records the true ground of this carnal motion in them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. They were but yet in nature, and did conceive carnally of him, and ſought onely to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by their relation to him, and to advance their own carnal ends and deſignes. And this makes it clear, that (as his <hi>brethren</hi> were not any other children born by <hi>Mary,</hi> but his kinſmen, called <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> after the manner of the Hebrews; ſo) they who made this motion were not any of his kinſmen whom he called to be Apoſtles; for, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready converted and choſen, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.70. but ſome others.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The hard and incertaine lots of Gods people will, in due time, have a good iſſue, and matter of praiſe; for, ſo is held out in their keeping <hi>the feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the iſſue of their wandring. And it is a lively embleme of the ſweet iſſue that ſhall be of the godlies wandring, when they ſhall enter out of the wilderneſſe of this world into their heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> 2. Albeit we are ready to forget our troubles, and the mercies wherewith they have been ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they are paſt and over; Yet it is Gods will they ſhould be remembred, with thankfulneſſe, and ſobriety, and with readineſſe to follow God, when ever he calls to new troubles: So much alſo is imported in their yearly obſervation of this feaſt, wherein they were not onely thankfully to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the mercy, but by their going out of their houſes, and dwelling in booths, and that at the time of gathering in their fruits, and when their barnes were full (for that was the time of this feaſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.13.) they were to teſtifie that preſent mercies had not made them forget former trials; that they would uſe them ſoberly, and were ready yet to leave all at his call, who had guided them ſo well in former trials. 3. Albeit praiſes be due to God, in all ages, in thankful remembrance of his mercies; yet the way of teſtifying thereof by ſolemne feaſts, is Jewiſh, and not to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Goſpel; Therefore, is it called (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) <hi>the Jewes feaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Carnal men, when they have the occaſion of ſpiritual publike ſolemnities and ordinances, do not minde the tight end, or Gods honour in going about them, Nor do they make conſcience of ſpiritual preparation, that they may profit by them, but all their care is how to attaine their own carnal ends, particularly, of vain-glory, in and by them; for, when this <hi>feaſt was at hand,</hi> verſe 2. all the preparation of theſe men for it, was to get Chriſt with them, that they might come to credit by him at it. 2. Chriſts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal friends and followers do follow him onely for their own ends, and in expectation of carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and glory by him; for, ſuch was their ſcope in this deſire. 3. It is high preſumption in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to preſume to preſcribe to Chriſt what to do, or when to do it; And particularly, to employ him ſo to order his matters as may moſt advance their carnal ends, and bring them in eſteeme; for, it was not ſimply a fault to wiſh him in <hi>Judea,</hi> for he went afterward, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. nor yet to deſire he ſhould be known to the world, ſeeing it was his end in coming, to ſhine as the light of the world; But it was their fault to carve out and preſcribe to him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48148:69"/>
when to depart, and to be ſo impudent, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that his manifeſtations might be made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their vain-glorious and carnal deſignes. 4. Men, when they are proſecuting their carnal and ambitious ends, will not want ſpiritual and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretexts, wherewith to mask them; for, ſo much appears in their firſt reaſon, <hi>go into Judea, that thy diſciples alſo may ſee the works that thou doeſt;</hi> wherein they ſeeme to be ſo taken up with thoughts of the publike good of his followers, as they dare indirectly chalenge him for ſleighting them ſo long. It is indeed a truth, that Chriſt will have a care of ſuch as give up their names to him, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are, that they faint not for want of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary encouragement. But they failed in propounding this, in That they made it but a mask to their carnal ends, (as indeed God looks not onely to deſires, but to the end and ſcope of the deſirerers;) That they could think to learn him how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his people, or guide them better then he did; That they tied his encouraging of his followers to his bodily preſence and miracles, whereas he was God, to ſupport them in his bodily abſence; and, That they think it a fault he ſhould withdraw his viſible preſence, even from his diſciples, when he is called of God to ſhun imminent dangers. 5. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unrenewed men do make it their onely aime, to become great by any gifts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have received; And they are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of another way, that they meaſure, even the moſt godly, by their own diſpoſitions, and do count them but ſilly, who do not thirſt after glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and reſpect; Therefore ſay they, for, <hi>no man doth any thing in ſecret, and he himſelf ſeeketh to be known openly;</hi> Whereby they do not meane ſo much, that he rubbed upon himſelf, by lurking in corners as a deceiver, and not coming to view, as an honeſt man ſhould do; But their carnal diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thought it impoſſible, that a man could be gifted as he was, and not thirſt after reputation in the world, and therefore, ſuppoſing that this was Chriſts aime alſo, they wonder he was ſo ſilly, and did not proſecute his ends more vigorouſly. 6. Men of eminent gifts are expoſed to very great danger, if they want ſincerity; having (beſide their own hearts, that can tell them too well what they are) many carnal friends, who may be Satans inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſuggeſt unto them tentations, to be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with conceit, and to carnal courſes and aimes; for, here Chriſt was tried with it, though the Prince of the world found nothing in him. 7. Such as are carnal and ambitious hunters after vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do care nothing what they are or do in ſecret, but all their thought is about what is open and publike, and how to frequent publike conventions, and make ſhews, that they may be taken notice of; for, ſo much appears in their counſel, <hi>If thou do</hi> (or ſince thou doeſt) <hi>theſe things, ſhew thy ſelfe to the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The grace of God doth not go by blood or natural acquaintance, but by free gift; for, they are <hi>his brethren,</hi> and yet that proves not their grace, <hi>neither did his brethren beleeve in him,</hi> more then the Capernaites; and therefore they are in as little account with him. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſts example is ground of comfort to them who have, and are oft-times put to trials by grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe friends; Though afterward we finde a change, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. 2. The truth of the grace of God in men, will appear, eſpecially, in their taking up Chriſt by faith, as he hath revealed himſelf, and in their cloſing with, and embracing of him, out of the ſenſe of their great need; for, this is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their want of grace, they <hi>did not beleeve in him;</hi> that is, they did not take up what he was, nor cloſe with him. 3. When men are ambitious, and hunt after vain-glory, and when they dare preſume to teach Chriſt his duty, it is an evidence of a graceleſs condition, at leaſt in ſo far; Therefore, it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a reaſon of their former preſumption and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>for neither did his brethren beleeve in him.</hi>

                  <p>In theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> we have Chriſts anſwer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal returned to their deſire, both by word and practice; Wherein, 1. Chriſt ſheweth that there was a great difference betwixt him and them, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. His time was not yet come, whereas theirs was alway ready. Which however it be true in general, that natural men, though, by right, they have not allowance to do what they liſt, at any time; yet in effect and practice, they walk as they liſt, and take any time they pleaſe; Whereas he behoved to chooſe times, and walk according to his Fathers direction: yet it ſeemes here rather to ſhew what difference there was betwixt him and them, in this going up. He who was maligned and hated, behoved to wait for a ſit time and ſeaſon, leſt he ſhould caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on a ſnare, and tempt God, but they could come no time wrong, being in no ſuch peril. This difference (2.) he confirmes from a reaſon, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. They might go up at any time, ſeeing the world could not hate them, who were but yet children of this world; but he behoved to chooſe his ſit time, being hated of the world, becauſe of his plain and free doctrine. 3. From this he inferreth, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. that they might go when they liſt, but he would not go till his full time came, 4. His practice is recorded, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. as agreeing with his reſolution: from <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Meekneſſe doth beſeeme Chriſt and his followers; and that they meet the impertinencies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48148:70"/>
of carnal men, without heat or paſſion: Therefore doth Chriſt ſo meekly anſwer their carnal deſire. 2. The Lord hath appointed times and ſeaſons for every courſe and lawful action, which prudent and godly men are bound to obſerve; for, ſo doth Chriſt obſerve, that <hi>his time is not yet come,</hi> to go to that feaſt. 3. Times of trouble and danger to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould make them very tender, to wait on Gods direction for every ſtep of their walking, that they neither caſt themſelves needleſſely on trouble, nor yet do ſinfully labour to avoid it; for, ſo much doth Chriſts practice teach, who being in danger, found that <hi>his time is not yet come</hi> to go up, albeit the feaſt was near, becauſe he was to go up privately. And as he knew his time by the Spirit of the Lord reſting on him; So he uſed this caution, that he might profeſſe his voluntary humiliation, even to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fear, for his peoples good, and that he might leave a pattern to them. 4. Such is the ordinary temper of this world, that Chriſt and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt oft-times lurk, when carnal men may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it without hazard; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>but your time is alwayes ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Unrenewed men, what ever their priviledges be, yet, are but of the ſame ſtamp, and in the ſame condition with the reſt of the world; they do ſavour of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in that condition, will get their portion in it; Therefore are the Jewes and the Rulers, from whom Chriſts hazard was at this time, called <hi>the world,</hi> albeit they judged far otherwiſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conſidering their priviledges. 2. Albeit the Lord, in his righteous judgement, do ſometime make the men of the world plagues and ſcourges one to another; Yet as there can be no communion kept with the world, unleſſe men will ſhare in their wickedneſſe: So it is moſt uſual that worldlings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree well enough together. Therefore ſaith he, <hi>The world cannot hate you,</hi> being ſuch as themſelves are. 3. Such as the men of the world are, ſuch are their actions and fruits; for, <hi>the works of the world are evil.</hi> Not onely have they groſſe vitious actions, but even ſuch actions as are in themſelves good or indifferent, are in them, evil. 4. Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed men will not readily be troubled or vexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their actions, but would ſleep ſecurely, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not vex them with telling them of their way; for, this is the worlds trouble here, that he <hi>teſtified</hi> that their <hi>works are evil.</hi> 5. Whatever be the hazard, yet Chriſts ſervants are bound, in their ſtations, to bear witneſſe againſt the evil courſes of the world; for, ſo doth Chriſts practice teach. 6. Such as would be faithful in their generation, in witneſſing againſt the courſes of the world, muſt lay their accompt to be hated for their pains; for, ſuch was Chriſts lot, <hi>but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, &amp;c.</hi> And this he did encounter with, not onely to expiate our love to the world, and our ſinful communion with it, but to caſt us a copy of what we are to expect. 7. Such is the perverſity of the corrupt world, that no evidence of affection, in dealing with them for their good, will gain them, but rather inſence them; for, albeit he but <hi>teſtified of their works,</hi> by his innocent life and doctrine, to reclaime them from them, yet the world <hi>hated him.</hi> 8. Whatever pretences of zeal perſecutors of Chriſt and his followers may have; Yet the true cauſe of their ſpleene, is the oppoſition that is made to their wickedneſſe and hypocriſie; for albeit they pretended to hate him, becauſe he had prophaned the Sabbath, as they alledged; yet Chriſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the true cauſe of this hatred, <hi>becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt approveth that Ordinances be reverenced; And albeit men be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt who adminiſter them, and they but carnal who go unto them; yet he allowes not that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or give over the uſe of the lawful Ordinances, as his appointed means; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Go ye up unto this feaſt,</hi> which however, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, it imports onely a permiſſion, and giving up of them to themſelves, who were ſo carnal, (as is to be after cleared;) yet, ſimply conſidered, it imports an approbation of that Ordinance, and that it was their duty to frequent it. 2. Such as ſeek Chriſts company onely for carnal and ambitious ends, may expect to want it, even in going about ſacred Ordinances; for, in ſo far did Chriſt give them up, as to want his company in this journey, where they expected onely carnal advantages by him. <hi>Go ye up, I go not up yet to this feaſt.</hi> 3. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walkers, eſpecially in times of trouble and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, will be very acurate in the leaſt circumſtances; So much appeareth in Chriſt, who goeth not <hi>up yet,</hi> becauſe albeit the <hi>time</hi> in general was <hi>come,</hi> yet it was not <hi>yet full come,</hi> and therefore he would not yet ſtir.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. It is not enough, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in times of trial, that men have clear light and good principles, unleſſe they have alſo honeſty and reſolution, to follow their light; for, herein Chriſt hath given us example, who, upon theſe grounds, <hi>abode ſtill in Galilee.</hi> 2. Chriſt is not changable, and one thing in his expreſſions, and another in his doings and actions, but is uniforme and ſtill the ſame, in his doings and ſayings; as here we ſee. 3. When the Lord giveth clear light to any to know their duty, they muſt not be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it upon any termes, whatever pretences might militate to the contrary, to brangle their reſolution; Therefore, albeit Chriſt knew that men would take advantage, to carp at him, becauſe of his lurking in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and this refuſal might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of contempt of his kinſmen; yet knowing that his time was not yet full come, <hi>he abode ſtill in Galilee.</hi>

In this <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſhewed, that at his own appointed time he went up, yet in a private way, not in the company of his kinſmen &amp; friends, but with his diſciples and ſome few followers, poſſibly (among other reaſons) that they might not intercept him by the way, and that he might try their thoughts of him, before he appeared, as afterward it fell forth. And here <hi>John</hi> paſſeth over ſome things that occurred in his journey, which are recorded by ſome of the reſt, that ſo he may haſten to the following hiſtory. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Such as have not embraced nor cloſed with Chriſt, but remain ſtill in their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, may yet be very careful to obſerve outward ordinances; for, <hi>his brethren were gone up.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lords ſervants may for a time, in ſome caſes, withdraw themſelves from danger; Yet when God calls them to appeare, they ſhould do it without ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the danger continue; for, when his time was full come, <hi>he alſo went up unto the feaſt,</hi> though the malice of the Jewes was not yet abated. 3. The cruelty and ingratitude of a people will not hold Chriſt away, where he hath any good to do, for, <hi>he went up</hi> again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> however they ſtood affected to him. 4. Courage in following of a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhould not be looked on as inconſiſtent with prudence; and with the carriage of our ſelves in a ſecret or open way, as may moſt contribute for the great work of our calling; Therefore Chriſt <hi>went up, not openly, but as it were in ſecret,</hi> whereby he not only ſheweth that he ſubjected himſelfe to this wary way, that he might purchaſe unto us boldneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; But as in the former purpoſe, we are taught how he ſanctified ſlight and retirement in his own perſon, and as afterward he leaveth us a pattern of undoubted boldneſſe: So here, by carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe privatly till he come up, and till the people be conveened, and his enemies ſomewhat ſettled, after they miſſe him at the beginning of the feaſt, he would teach them that as faint-heartedneſſe is none of his leſſons, ſo neither is temerity and raſhneſſe approven by him; And that great circumſpection ſhould be uſed in our engageing in trial, and then it ſhould be reſolutely managed.</p>

And, 1. It is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 11. That they made inquiſition for him; which may be taken as the multitudes fact who had heard of him, or had heard him preach and ſeen his miracles, who now miſſe him at the feaſt. As in deed, when Chriſts doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ine and works are notable and famous, many may talk of him and deſire to ſee him, who yet make but little uſe of him or them either. But it ſeems rather to be meant of the wicked Jewes, and their Rulers, who ſought to ſtay him. And this appeares not only from their contemptible deſignation of him, <hi>where is he?</hi> but from their names <hi>the Jewes</hi> (the men of <hi>Judea,</hi> and chiefly the Rulers, called of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by that name, not only becauſe they were of <hi>Judea,</hi> but becauſe the guilt of their cruelty lay upon many of the Nation, who joyned too much with them in it, as well as themſelves) who are ſaid to ſeek his life, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and who are diſtinguiſhed here from <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or <hi>multitude,</hi> ver. 12. And are cauſe of terrour to the people, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 2. The people expreſſe their different thoughts of him, ſome allowing him the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of being a good man, and others traducing him as a ſeducer, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. 3. The manner of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is ſecret, by way of muttering, and that for fear of the Jewes, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which is to be underſtood chiefly of the better ſort, that they durſt not ſpeak openly of him; yet it may be conceived alſo, that they would have all to let it alone, that ſo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be buried.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. It is one part of Chriſts and his followers trial and hard lot, that their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters do labour to bear them down, by putting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and affronts upon them before the world; for, ſo do they ſpeak of him, <hi>where is he?</hi> with contempt and diſdain. 2. Albeit enemies ſeeme to think very contemptibly of Chriſt and his followers, and of what they can do againſt them; yet for all that they will not get the terrour of him put out of their hearts: for, albeit they ſeem to deſpiſe him, yet <hi>they ſought him,</hi> to take him out of the way. 3. Albeit Chriſt and his followers ſhould carry themſelves never ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, yet perſecuters will not let them alone; and while they ceaſe to be, they will ſtill be an eye ſore to the world; for, albeit he had now ſtayed long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and had not troubled them, and there was no appearance of his coming, or being come as yet, more then at the laſt paſſover; Yet they are not at eaſe, but <hi>ſought him.</hi> 4. Even publick ſolemnities of ſacred worſhip will not mollifie, nor direct perſecuters from their bloody deſignes; for, <hi>then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men, by their violence and cruelty, thinking to ſuppreſſe Chriſt and his truth, may readily thereby awaken people, to think and ſay more of him; for, upon the back of their ſearch, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>and there was much murmuring</hi> (or ſecret whiſperings, the cauſe whereof is ſhewed, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.) <hi>among the people concerning him,</hi> pointing out (as would appear) that their narrow ſearch for him, put him in the peoples mindes and mouths. And ſo not only Chriſt is ſpoken of when they were dumb, and would have others ſilent, but beyond their intentions, they occaſion this themſelves. 2. This peoples making Chriſt the ſubject of their conference,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48148:71"/>
even behind his back, when yet all of them had little or no knowledge of him, and many of them no love at all to him; may ſhame them who ſhould know more, and who profeſſe more love unto him, and yet entertain but few thoughts of him, and little confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence concerning him. 3. Chriſt and his truth are oft-times the ſubject of great contradiction in the world, and do encounter with variety of tempers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; for, ſo was it here, ſome are bitter, and others are more charitable. 4. Not only open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do great wrong to Chriſt, but even ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing welwiſhers, by their indifferent way of pleading for him, and their ſhallow conceptions of him, do prove themſelves to be but ſmall friends unto him; for, ſuch were theſe here, who pleaded only, <hi>He is a good man.</hi> 5. As it is a very great iniquity in men, when they not only erre themſelves from the truth, but turne Seducers of others, (for, here, they object it as a juſtly odious crime, <hi>he deceiveth the people;</hi>) So it is no ſtrange thing to ſee men brand Chriſt and his friends with this infamous title, of being deceivers, and under this pretext, to cry down all that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in their defence; for, <hi>others ſaid, nay,</hi> (he is no good man) <hi>but he deceiveth the people.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver</hi> 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the ſad caſe, and too often the condition of the viſible Church, to be ſo corrupt, as truth dare not be avowed in it; and the Teachers thereof become a terrour to all who would maintain ſound doctrine; for, ſo was it here, <hi>Howbeit,</hi> (whatever they whiſpered, yet) <hi>no man ſpake openly of him, for fear of the Jewes.</hi> 2. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſlaviſh fear in men will eaſily bear down their affection to Chriſt, if it be but coldriffe and ill principled; for, ſo did it with theſe here, who had but little to plead for him. 3. When Satan cannot prevaile by violence, he may ſometime eſſay to weary Chriſt and his followers out, by burying all debates and contraverſies, that in proceſſe of time, truth may weare out and be buried; for, (as was hinted in the Expoſition) ſo may it be taken here alſo; They would have none to ſpeak at all concerning him on any ſide, that ſo thoughts of him may weare out in time, he having been ſo long abſent. However it be, yet this is a courſe that oft-times prevaileth much, (though men never gain their point by it) and it ſhould warn us to look on <hi>being let alone</hi> many time, as a trial.</p>

In this <hi>ver.</hi> is recorded that Chriſt went publickly into the Temple and taught, whereby he ſupplyed the defect of the dumb and corrupt Prieſts, who at ſuch ſolemnities were bound to teach the people out of the law. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till <hi>the midſt of the feaſt,</hi> ſheweth, that albeit he ſubjected himſelfe to fulfil all righteouſneſſe, yet his great errand was not the feaſt, but the gaining of ſouls at it. And it teacheth, that the gaining of ſouls to Chriſt is the great work and end, to which the uſe of all Ordinances ſhould be directed. 2. While they are about ſacrifices in the Temple; Chriſt goeth up and teacheth there; no doubt, (as appeareth from the following Sermon, <hi>ver.</hi> 37.) inviting them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as the ſubſtance of all theſe ſhadows; And it teacheth, that when people are taken up with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of external Ordinances, they have much need of Chriſts teaching, that they reſt not on theſe, but preſſe after the marrow and ſubſtance of them. This was the great ſinne of that time, that they reſted on theſe rites, and had few or none to bid them go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And albeit the true Religion be a living way, wherein men may ſtill continue freſh and lively, even to old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14. Yet formality is a very frequent diſeaſe, and they who labour hard till they attain to ſomewhat, may be ready to ſit down, when they have attained it. 3. In that Chriſt, who before lurked and kept himſelfe ſecret, doth now appeare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the Temple; It teacheth, that whatever caution Chriſts ſervants ſhould uſe, yet when their calling preſſeth them, they ſhould without fear, caſt themſelves, if it were in the midſt of bodily dangers; as their Maſter did before them. 4. Albeit <hi>John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord many Sermons, which the reſt omit; yet he doth not expreſſe what Chriſt preached at this time; only it appeares from the following <hi>ver.</hi> that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was admirable. This the Lord hath, in deep wiſdom, ordered, to teach, That as we are bound to know what Chriſt revealeth, ſo we ſhould be ſober, and ſet bounds to our curioſitie, when he is pleaſed to keep up any thing: And as Chriſt hath revealed all that is neceſſary for ſalvation; ſo by his wrapping up ſome things in ſilence, he would ſharpen our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and encreaſe our deſire after that day, wherein we ſhall know as we are known.</p>

                  <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> it is recorded, that they hearing Chriſt preach ſo well, and learnedly, though he was never
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48148:71"/>
brought up at their publick ſchooles, do marvel at it, in ſtead of ſeeing God in it. This is aſcribed to <hi>the Jewes,</hi> which may be either underſtood generally, of the multitude there conveened, who were of that Nation; or, it may be, his malicious enemies did begin this debate and conference, though afterward the multitude, who knew not their plots, <hi>ver</hi> 20. do interpoſe in it; And it is not unlike, that by this wondering, they would bring Chriſt in ſuſpition, as not having his skill by good means, ſeeing he was no ſcholar. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Chriſts knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the things of God, is admirable, even his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being Judges; for, <hi>the Jewes marvelled,</hi> &amp;c. they admired both the meaſure of his knowledge, and the way of attaining it, without means. Though this being extraordinary in him, is not to be drawen into ordinary imitation. 2. Whatever be the ſeeming great effects of Chriſts doctrine among a people, yet ſo long as they want faith, it will be all to no purpoſe; for, albeit it was much that they ſhould <hi>marvel,</hi> yet ſince they beleeved not, it was, in the beſt of them, nothing elſe but ſtupidity. The leaſt degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith is beyond all admiration, without it. 3. The corrupt heart of man is ready to retort, even the moſt undeniable and convincing arguments plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt, and to make uſe of them to their own hardning; for, albeit Chriſts <hi>knowing of letters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never learned,</hi> was an undeniable evidence that he was taught of God, and filled with the Spirit; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophecie, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11.2, 3. yet they uſe it as a ground of exception. 4. Such is the perverſitie of corrupt men by nature, in oppoſing of Chriſt, that nothing can be done or ſaid, but they will bend their wits to cavil at it; for, if Chriſt had preached but in an ordinary way, they would have thought nothing of him: And if he preach to admiration, then they will ſtrive to render that ſuſpitious.</p>

                  <p>Followeth Chriſts reply, wherein he vindicates his doctrine, and then juſtifieth his old practice; And firſt, he declareth that he had not his doctrine from Satan, nor by any humane art or induſtry, but from his father whoſe Ambaſſadour he was, and that he ſpake not his own minde only, but the Fathers. While he ſaith, it is not his, but the Fathers; the meaning is not to ſeclude him ſimply, but to ſhew that he deviſed it not of himſelfe as man, (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only of him) and without the Father; But as he was God equal with the Father, and ſo natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew all his myſteries, and as man, had knowledge thereof, by communication from his Godhead; So all this was communicate to him from the Father, who ſent him to the world to reveal his counſel; And this might appear in his divine furniture without all humane induſtry. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Chriſt fully knowes the Fathers minde and counſel, ſo he is the faithful revealer thereof; for, his <hi>doctrine</hi> is <hi>the Fathers who ſent him;</hi> It is from the Father, and he publiſheth it. 2. It may commend the doctrine of the Goſpel, that not only it is of God, but that he ſent his Sonne into the world, to publiſh it; for, ſo doth Chriſt commend his doctrine here. 3. It is the duty of faithful Miniſters, not only to wait for a calling from God, but to ſee that they bring nothing forth, but what they have from God; for, herein Chriſt is a patterne, who was <hi>ſent,</hi> and whoſe <hi>doctrine was not his own, but his that ſent him.</hi> 4. No doctrine or Preacher, how admirable and raviſhing ſoever, are to be heard in the Church, but they who are ſent and bring their meſſage from God; Therefore, albeit they <hi>marvelled</hi> at him, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. yet he thinks not that enough, unleſſe they be perſwaded that he and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are of God. 5.

                  <p>Next, becauſe they would not readily credite him, in aſſerting his doctrine to be of God; Therefore he ſubjoines two Rules and helps whereby they might be enabled to try doctrine and Teachers.

To wit, that he be a pious man, and one who according to light received, walks in Gods wayes. Such a one hath the promiſe that he ſhall be made able to diſcerne whether his doctrine be divine, or deviſed by himſelfe. The ſecond Rule and help in trial, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. relates to the perſon and doctrine to be tried; wherein he aſſerts, that a man who runs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and preacheth his own inventions, doth in his carriage, and by his doctrine, but ſeek to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; whereas he, who being ſent of God, makes it his ſcope in his carriage to exalt God only, and the nature of his doctrine tends to that, doth prove that he is a preacher of truth, and that there is no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe nor fraud in his doctrine.

                     </gap>ſtanding of this, we are to conſider, That Chriſt in giving theſe rules of trial, doth not ſeclude other rules and proofes of the truth of his doctrine already given, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and particularly, that of Scripture; For Chriſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes it elſewhere clear, that good men, in ſome caſes, may be miſled with errour, and unrenewed men may know and embrace truth, though not ſavingly; And on the other hand, erroneous Teachers and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines may pretend to be much for God, and may cry out on truth, as denying to God his glory; But
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48148:72"/>
Chriſts meaning is, to ſhew, That his doctrine being undeniably true, and according to Scripture, it was odious in them to contradict it by wicked rebellion, and to evidence by their oppoſition, that they were not tender walkers. And that this is ſo much the more hainous, that they ſaw his whole carriage, and the nature and ſcope of his doctrine, tend on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y to glorifie his Father, and not to advance his own private glory. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. It is the duty of the Lords people, not to receive Doctrine or Teachers upon truſt, but to try and diſcerne, who are ſent of God, and who not, and who ſpeaks true or falſe doctrine; for, it is here imported, that they ſhould know who are <hi>ſent,</hi> and whether their doctrine be <hi>of God,</hi> or <hi>of themſelves.</hi> 2. Every man is not a fit diſcerner of Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but many through their own default, are left deſtitute of ſuch a mercy; for, ſo doth the requiring of qualifications, in theſe who trie, impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such as truely fear God, and make conſcience of known truth in their converſation, have his promiſe for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and diſcerning, to try doctrine; for, ſo doth the promiſe expreſſely hold out, <hi>if any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, &amp;c.</hi> Which we may branch out in theſe. 1. Such have indeed the promiſe of diſcerning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ungodlineſſe and looſe practices provokes God to withold diſcerning light. 2.

Such as make conſcience of known light in their practice are in Gods way for attaining further light in dubious contraverſies. 6. Such as come to hear, with a purpoſe to examine doctrine by carnal reaſon, and to like or diſlike of it, according as it ſhall reliſh or be diſpleaſing to their luſts, will readily reject ſound doctrine; But he that cometh with a ſubjected minde, and fixed reſolution to receive and obey, what ſhall be found to be the will of God, ſhall get a diſcerning Spirit, unleſſe God have him to humble for ſome former guilt, of which he hath not yet repented. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 4. The great ſcope of Preachers, and of their doctrine, ſhould be, to deny and abaſe themſelves, and to exalt and ſeek Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for, ſo doth Chriſt teach, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. that a teacher <hi>ſhould ſeek his glory that ſent him:</hi> and ſo himſelfe did in carriage and doctrine. 5. Such as do run unſent, and do broach their own inventions and errours, they certainly affect the praiſe of men, and hunt after vain-glory, let them pretend to what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humilitie they will; for, <hi>he that ſpeaketh of himſelfe, ſeeketh his own glory,</hi> the ſcope of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tendeth to that. And albeit ſelfe-ſeekers may be for the truth, and may make uſe of it, for their own ends; yet they are fitted to go wrong, if they have a tentation, and they will go wrong, before they be not reſpected; Yea, and God is provoked to give them up to go wrong. 6. As true doctrine doth tend to ſet forth Gods glory, and to exalt him; So cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine, deviſed by men, doth not aime at Gods glory indeed, whatever it ſeem to do: for, in this reſpect alſo, <hi>he that ſpaketh of himſelfe, ſeeketh his own glory;</hi> the nature of his doctrine riſeth no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then his own or another creatures glory; whereas <hi>he that is true,</hi> or ſound in doctrine, <hi>ſeeketh his glory that ſent him.</hi> That this may appeare, conſider. 1. Many corrupt and erroneous doctrines do eminently exalt the creature, in its merit, free-will, liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of its actions, &amp;c. to the manifeſt depriving of God of the glory of grace, dominion, and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the abaſing of Chriſt, and his ſufferings, the denial of providence, &amp;c. 2. Many opinions and practices in Religion, though they pretend to, and ſeem to ſpeak much ſelfe denial, in theſe who profeſſe and practice them; yet they never aſcend to give glory to God, but to exalt another creature in his roome; Such as that voluntary humility, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. 3. Though ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions get place in the world, and are cried up as exalting God and Chriſt; Yet he will have no ſuch honour, and it is but a real diſhonouring of him, to think that he needs a lie to ſet out his glory, and to maintain errour under a pretext that otherwiſe he will want his glory; See <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.7, 8, 9. 4. As no erroneous opinion doth tend to Gods glory, ſo no erroneous perſon doth really minde it in maintaining that errour, but would exalt himſelfe under a pretext of humility, and ſeeks to be accounted and reputed of as ſomewhat, becauſe of his new opinions. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 7. To preach ſound doctrine, is great faithfulneſſe to God, and to the ſouls of people, who are taught; whereas the unſound Teacher commits the greateſt, and moſt cruel, of frauds, as being falſe to God, and to the ſouls of people, Therefore it is ſaid of the Teacher of ſound doctrine, <hi>the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſſe is in him;</hi> Not that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, (though Chriſt was ſo, being truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe it ſelfe) but that being <hi>true,</hi> he deales <hi>righteouſly,</hi> in not having any fraud in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt having vindicate his doctrine, proceeds now to vindicate his practice, in healing the impotent man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. which had ſo long ſtuck in their mindes as an odious practice. This he doth upon two grounds, whereof the firſt (in this <hi>ver.</hi>) is by way of retortion upon themſelves, that they ſhould ſeek to ſlay him for a ſuppoſed breach of the Law, when yet none of themſelves, to whom the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> did keep it. For clearing this reaſon, 1. We muſt remember, that Chriſt hath already juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this deed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.) upon convincing grounds, and therefore now he uſeth only ſuch defences as might pinch them a little nearer. 2. As this compariſon of his deed with their tranſgreſſions, doth no wayes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that he was guilty, as they were; So neither is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48148:72"/>
it Chriſts ſcope to teach men, to think their own faults the leſſe, that others are guilty alſo. 3. Nor is it Chriſts ſcope, that men ſhould repine becauſe they are reproved by others that are guilty; nor yet that mens own guilt ſhould altogether cloſe their mouths from reproving of others; for neither was he guilty, nor is he teaching men how to defend themſelves in ill courſes. But Chriſt is reaſoning here, not ſo much to the matter, as to the perſons of theſe that perſecuted him; and ſheweth, that they were not meet challengers of him, who were ſo groſſe violators of the Law in their own practice; and that, however they pretended great zeal to the Sabbath in perſecuting him; yet, their own carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age teſtified how little they reſpected the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of horrid tranſgreſſions, and many of them making the Law void by their traditions. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> 1. Faithful Miniſters ought not onely to be able to hold forth ſound doctrine, and to give a reaſon of it, but alſo to ſtop their mouths who, by unjuſt aſpertions caſt upon their perſons, labour to fruſtrate and make void their miniſtry; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt having defended his doctrine, doth now vindicate his practice. 2. As Chriſt knoweth the ſecret intentions of his enemies; ſo he is alwayes ready to remove all ſcruples againſt him, and to clear that he is unjuſtly hated and perſecuted; for, he knew their preſent intentions (of which <hi>verſe</hi> 25.) though the people were ignorant of it, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. and puts them to it, why <hi>go ye about to kill me.</hi> 3. As the Law of God doth oblige men to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, by reaſon of his authority who enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; So it addes to the obligation, when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſider how eminently God hath been ſeen in enjoyning of it, and what priviledges they enjoy by having of it; Therefore, when he is about to urge their obligation to obedience from the Law, he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to conſider, <hi>Did not Moſes</hi> (whom not onely ye honour, but who was trench-man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed familiarly with God, when he appeared in glory upon the mount) <hi>give you the Law?</hi> and not to other Nations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. He ſpeaks to them who were ſucceſſors to theſe who received it, as if they had been then preſent. 4. Albeit the Law hold forth, and oblige men to duty, yet not only are there ſome who groſly tranſgreſſe againſt it, but there are none who can make it appear that they keep it perfectly; for, ſaith he, <hi>yet none of you keepeth the Law,</hi> and not ſome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And albeit there were many better then they, who ſincerely endeavoured to obſerve it, yet even theſe did not attain to perfection. 5. Albeit men may, and ſhould, in their ſtations, reprove and cenſure others who are guilty, even though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be compaſſed with infitmities and failings, yet not onely it is ſad when groſſe tranſgreſſours of the Law have power in their hands, which they employ againſt the innocent, as if they were guilty, (as here they did with Chriſt.) But it concernes every one who hath a calling to reprove and cenſure. 1. To labour, ſo farre as may be, to be blameleſſe themſelves, otherwiſe they do undergo much ſhame, and do fruſtrate the end of their dealing with others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.4. 2. To be more taken up with their own failings, then with the failings of others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. And, upon this, 3. To deal compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately with others in their failings, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves of their own infirmities. All this is imported in Chriſts challenge of them (as it is before explained (that they ſhould deal ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently with him for a ſuppoſed breach of the Law, when yet they were little affected with their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all miſcarriages, <hi>Doctrine</hi> 6. The Lord reckons it to be but hypocriſie and fury, when men pretend zeal for God againſt others, and in ſome matters and failings; and yet do allow themſelves in as bad or worſe courſes, for, ſo much alſo doth Chriſts reaſoning import, that however they pretended it was zeal for the Law and Sabbath made them ſo hot in purſuing him; yet if it had been ſo, they would have made more conſcience of it in their own practice, And indeed, many may pretend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God in ſomewhat they do, who, when their other works are ſeen, do give their profeſſion the lie.</p>

For <hi>Moſes</hi> did give them a Law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the fathers, that Circumciſion ſhould be adminiſtred on the eighth day, and they did circumciſe on the Sabbath day, if it fell to be the eighth, without any ſcruple or violation of the Law; yea, in obedience to the Law. And therefore they had no cauſe to be angry at him becauſe he had healed a man both in ſoul and body on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, The parallel here is not ſo much betwixt the perſon of Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as betwixt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enjoyned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and practiſed by them, and Chriſts deed. For clearing whereof, Conſider, 1. The equality, or parallel, conſiſts in this, that, as Circumciſion was a work of piety, as being a Sacrament and Seal of the Covenant; So alſo it was a work of neceſſity, in reſpect of the precept, <hi>that the Law of Moſes might not be broken.</hi> And on the ſame grounds was Chriſts work to be juſtified, being a work of piety, to heal a mans ſoul, and a work of charity and neceſſity, to help a man who had been ſo long in diſtreſſe. We need not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to enquire, why the Lord would have Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion preciſely on the eighth day; whether, becauſe he would have the ſeventh day (which Phyſicians account a critical day) over, before this painful Sacrament were adminiſtred, but would have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed no longer; or, upon ſome other typical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It ſufficeth us, that Gods will is a ſufficient reaſon for his command. 2. There may alſo ſome diſparity be found betwixt theſe two, which pleads yet more ſtrongly for Chriſts practice, As, 1. In adminiſtring of Circumciſion, there was more pains and labour on the Sabbath, then in what he did, having with a word made the man whole. 2. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, though an Ordinance of God, yet was painful, and for awhile hurtful to the body; He, on the contrary, healed him who had been long pained. 3. Albeit Circumciſion was a work of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it was a Seal of the righteouſneſſe which is by ſaith; yet many who received it, did not get their hearts circumciſed; And therefore his deed was much more a work of piety, having not onely heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mans body, but his ſoul alſo; for, ſo the parallel runs, and ſo theſe words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>I have made a man every whit whole,</hi> or, <hi>the whole man whole,</hi> and ſo appears in part from his adhering to Chriſts directions, when they are quarreled, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ought to be deaf men to reproaches, and to carry themſelves modeſtly, when they meet with perſonal injuries and affronts; As here Chriſt by his practice doth teach, who never ſo much as owned their bitter reflection, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. 2. Men who are moſt wicked and lewd, may yet ſo far delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſeek to deceive others, as they cannot look upon ſome ſuppoſed ills but with wonder and aſtoniſhment; for, theſe vile men did <hi>all marvel</hi> at this work of Chriſt, pretending to deteſt it as an horrid prophanation, When yet they were nothing affected with their own groſſe abuſes and violation of the Law. 3. It is great injuſtice, and want of charity, to ſtumble at one failing of a man (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be real) who makes not an habit of it, but otherwiſe is blameleſſe; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I have done one work, and ye all marvel,</hi> wherein he not onely oppoſeth his own work to their frequent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing on the Sabbath, but ſheweth that it was a great teſtimony of his innocency, that they could object but that one work to him, and that it was great injuſtice to taxe him ſo hardly (though it had not been right,) ſeeing he had no cuſtome of ſuch tranſgreſſions. 4. The Lord, in his deep wiſdome, hath ſo contrived his Law, that albeit divers precepts concurring at one time, may ſeeme to croſſe one another; yet no man that is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of an erring conſcience, (who, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever way he turn him, doth either ſinne materially againſt the Law, or interpretatively againſt God, in going over the light of his conſcience:) will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want a lawful out-gate, but may follow one command without violation of another: for, ſo doth Chriſts arguing teach; His inſtance of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without prophanation of the Sabbath, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from thence to juſtifie his own practice, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that theſe particular inſtances are grounded on a general rule, That in the concurrence of many ſeeming contrary precepts, it is the will of God, that one of them ſhould give place to the other for that time, and that without ſinne in him who doth ſo, Which may be branched out thus, 1. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral command gives way to a ſpecial precept, when both cannot be obſerved at one time; As here, the general command of ſanctifying the Sabbath, gives place to the command of Circumciſion on the eighth day, when that day fell to be the Sabbath. 2. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48148:73"/>
moral duties of the firſt Table take place of duties of the ſecond Table, when they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Though a man be bound to provide for his family, to love his friends, wife, and children; yet all theſe muſt give place to his love to God and his truth, and he muſt forſake all theſe, yea, and (in ſome reſpect) hate them, when they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in his duty to God. 3. Ceremonial duties and external performances of the firſt Table, do give place to moral duties of the ſecond Table; And therefore Chriſt frequently juſtifieth his own and his diſciples practices on the Sabbath, by ſhewing that God required mercy, and not ſacrifice. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrino</hi> 5. Albeit it be the will of God, that his people do ſanctifie the Sabbath, by ceaſing from their ordinary imployments, yet ſeveral works may be done thereupon, without violation thereof; for, Chriſts inſtancing of Circumciſion on the Sabbath, without breaking of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of his own fact, ſheweth, that theſe inſtances are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this general rule, That the doing of every work upon the Sabbath, is not a violation thereof. And particularly, 1. Works of piety are the very ſanctifying of the Sabbath; as here, to adminiſtrate a Sacrament, and do good to a mans ſoul, and the Prieſts were blameleſſe in killing and waſhing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices on that day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.5. And we under the Goſpel, ſhould go about our work with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light on that day, in regard it is more ſpiritual and eaſie, then formerly. 2. Some works, albeit they be not works of piety, yet are lawful, in ſo far us they are neceſſary means of, and have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto works of piety: So were they allowed a Sabbath dayes journey to go to their ſolemne meetings and worſhip, and the pains that men take in needful apparelling and refreſhing of their bodies, and going to the publike places of worſhip are no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Sabbath, if they be done with a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes heart. 3. Works of mercy and charity are alſo lawful on the Sabbath; as here, it was lawful to relieve a miſerable man, ſo alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 14.5. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding they be ſuch works indeed, not onely in the intention of the worker, but ſuch as in their own nature are neceſſarily required for performance of mercie and charity. 4. Works of neceſſity may lawfully be done on the Sabbath, though they were ſervile employments; as here Circumciſion was, in reſpect of the command, and his healing of the man. See <hi>Luke</hi> 13.15. Yet that we abuſe not this, and violate the Sabbath under a pretext of neceſſity, We ought, 1. To diſtinguiſh betwixt a neceſſity that is inevitable, into which providence caſts us, and a neceſſity that is only contracted through our own former negligence; The firſt doth warrand us to work what we are neceſſitate to do, but the other doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us in guilt, whatever may be done upon it. 2. We are to diſtinguiſh betwixt a neceſſity that is onely imminent, or poſſible, and feared that it may come, and a neceſſity that is incumbent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The former cannot warrand a man to work on the Sabbath, but the latter doth. A man muſt not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his cornes upon the Sabbath, becauſe he fears it may raine the next day, or a ſtood may come and carry it away, but a man may recover and preſerve his cornes on the Sabbath from being carried away with a preſent inundation. 3. We are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt the ceaſing of gain, by the intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a lawful calling on the Sabbath, and an emergent damage, by reaſon of ſome providential diſpenſations. The former doth not warrand work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sabbath day, but the latter doth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be neceſſary that a man improve his means in a lawful calling, for the maintenance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; Yet it is not lawful for him to continue his trade and calling on the Sabbath, upon pretence that he will be a loſer by the intermiſſion thereof. But a man may lawfully recover his means from fire, water, or other accidents, on that day. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 6. Men who are poſſeſſed with ſelf-love, and with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt others, will readily count that a fault in their neighbours, which yet is no fault, and will allow that in themſelves, which they condemne in others; for, ſo doth Chriſts reaſoning, from their practice to his deed, import, that they did theſe things as approven ſervice, as they were, and yet when he did the like, they were <hi>angry at him.</hi> And ſo doth he elſewhere plead from the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and of their Prieſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3, 4, 5. 7. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſecutors of Chriſt and his people do pretend, yet the riſing glory of Chriſt, and of his truth, is the true cauſe of their ſpleene; Therefore, albeit they made a noiſe about the mans carrying of his bed on the Sabbath, <hi>Chaper</hi> 5. 10. yet he tels them the true cauſe is, <hi>I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o am glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. 8. Chriſts pleading for this, as a work of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as the parallel beareth, and hath been ſhewed in the Expoſition, doth import that Chriſt did heal this mans ſoul as well as his body. And ſo it teacheth, 1. As men have ſoul diſeaſes, as well as bodily, whereof they ſhould be chiefly ſenſible, and which, till they be cured, men are never compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whole: So it may be an encouragement to go to Chriſt with outward troubles, that in ſeeking help to theſe, men may get that, and ſpiritual mercies alſo; for, ſo dealt he with this poor man, whoſe great care was onely to be healed of his long infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. 2. It is a very dangerous condition, to be ſent to Chriſt with outward trouble, and yet not get ſome ſpiritual and ſaving benefit from him, with their deliverance, before they come away; for, it was Chriſts way when perſons were brought to him with outward troubles, to cure their ſouls before they came away. It ſaith much to the incurableneſſe of mens ſpiritual condition, when they are afflicted, and make ſome faſhion of coming to Chriſt with it; yea, and are delivered, and yet continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 9. His pleading this as a work of charity and neceſſity, teacheth, That mercy and compaſſion in Chriſt will omit no occaſion of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf comfortable to the miſerable, and them that are in neceſſity; for, he will not intermit to help them when he ſeeth them, even albeit it be the Sabbath. And this will yet further appear, if we conſider that one might object, that there was no ſuch neceſſity, but the man who had endured that infirmity thirty eight years, might endure it yet one day; whereas Circumciſion in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

could not be omitted. But the anſwer is eaſie, that not only the duty of charity requireth that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable be preſently helped; but, however the man might have endured it, yet Chriſts love and pity laid on the neceſſity, and could not forbear. And albeit the man might be hardened in his trouble, by reaſon of long continuance; yet Chriſts pitie is as tender towards him as if it had been the firſt day; yea, ſo much the more, as he had endured it ſo long, albeit in deep wiſdome he reſerved the cure for his own hand. This may help to correct the jealous thoughts of Gods people, who complain that they are forgotten under their long continued trials. 10. In declaring that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them Circumciſion, Chriſt adds a correction, <hi>not becauſe it is of Moſes, but of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> (as indeed it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> long before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10.) Whereby, 1. He would put them in minde that there was a covenant and promiſe made, and ſeals annexed to it, long before the giving of the law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſo they might gather, that the law, which came after, could not make the promiſe void, as it is argued, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. 2.

It teacheth, That when eminent inſtruments are too much doated on, and idolized by men, it provokes the Lord to debaſe them, and to let it be ſeen that they are but his inſtruments; As here he doth with <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt having thus debated with the Jewes and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, about his doctrine and practice, he (in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place) is aſſaulted by the inhabitants of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> who knew the Rulers plots better then others. And, 1. They crie out upon their Rulers, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is become of their zeal and forwardneſſe, who were ſeeking him to kill him, and yet now when he preaches ſo boldly, they meddle not with him. 2. They alledge, in deriſion, that the Rulers were ſo moderate, poſſibly, becauſe they beleeved him to be the Meſſiah; But as for them, they think they have ſtrong reaſons wherefore they could not joine with them in that opinion. For they know whence this man is, whereas no man will know whence the Meſſiah is when he cometh. As for the firſt part of their reaſon it cometh more fitly to be conſidered in Chriſts anſwer: But in the ſecond part, they aſſert a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt untruth; for, albeit Chriſt, in reſpect of his Godhead, was prefigured by <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> who in that ſtate is brought in Scripture, <hi>without father and mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life.</hi> Heb. 7.3. and it is ſaid of Chriſt, in that reſpect, <hi>who ſhall declare his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Iſa. 53.8. Yet it is as clear that in reſpect of his humanity, the Scripture clearly points out, what tribe he ſhould come of, his deſcent, family and linage, and the place of his birth. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. When wicked men are put to ſilence in debates, yet will they not be gained, but this will irritate their corruptions to ſtart new queſtions about truth, and new preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt the maintainers thereof; for, their not replying to his reaſonings, makes it clear they were convinced; and yet this availeth not, but they are irritate and imbittered that the Phariſees are not more violent, and they run to new debates. 2. Ordinarily they who enjoy moſt advantages in a viſible Church,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48148:74"/>
do in a declining time prove worſt of any; for, <hi>they of Jeruſalem,</hi> the chiefe City, and the place of ſolemne publike worſhip for all the Nation, are more upon the perſecutors plots, and more enraged, then any. 3. God can preſerve his own, in the faithful diſcharge of their duty, in ill times, in an admirable way, ſo that even their enemies themſelves may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it; for, ſay they, <hi>Is not this he whom they ſeek to kill? and yet he ſpeaketh boldly and they ſay nothing to him;</hi> They wonder that, conſidering his boldneſſe and the Rulers reſolutions, he was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, ſeeing they might eaſily do it when he caſt himſelfe among their hands. But hereby they do alſo hold out, (though they conſidered it not) that there was an admirable providence of God about him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them till his hour came. And indeed, it is no leſſe then a wonder, to ſee Gods people carried through, amidſt the many ſecret and cruel plots of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.1. And it would be admired yet more by Saints, if they were privy to all the ſore hearts enemies have for their miſcarried deſignes. 4. It will never be mens honeſty and courage in an evil time, that will haſten trouble upon them, before God ſee it meet to try them; But their fainting doth rather provoke God to ſend upon them what they fear, and would decline; for, of this Chriſts experience is an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proofe; He was in the midſt of enraged perſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>he ſpake boldly,</hi> and yet ſay they, <hi>lo, they ſay nothing to him,</hi> they give him not ſo much as an ill word for his pains. 5. Wicked Rulers and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when they are worſt, will never want inſtigatours to encourage them in it, yea, and to carp at them that they are not violent enough; for, ſuch did theſe <hi>of Jeruſalem</hi> prove to the Phariſees. 6. Free preaching is that which the world cannot endure, nor hear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being enraged; for, that he <hi>ſpeaketh boldly,</hi> is their eye-ſore. 7. A viſible Church may grow ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that it will be accounted the greateſt crime and reproach that may be, to receive or profeſſe the moſt neceſſary and fundamental truths; for, they account it a great indignity in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to <hi>know indeed that this is the very Chriſt.</hi> They have reaſon to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods mercie who live in times wherein it is their glory, and not their reproach, to avow this. And the godly, even in a viſible Church, ſhould be looking that their trial may come to that height in declining times. 8. Such as are in power, and do not rule for God, are juſtly contemptible, and ſlaves, in a ſort, to them who follow them in wickedneſſe; for, the Rulers muſt take a taunt, from their perſecuting aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates and followers. 9. It is undeniably groſſe and abominable wickedneſſe for men to profeſſe they know and acknowledge Chriſt, and yet to perſecute him and his truth; for, ſo much do theſe men grant, that if the Rulers knew he were the Chriſt, it was ſufficient to turn them from their reſolutions of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him. 10. It is commendable that men, in matters of Religion, do not pin their faith upon the ſleeve of any, how eminent ſoever they be, and though they were never ſo much eſteemed by themſelves; But that they have a reaſon of their hope in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for, albeit theſe men erred dangerouſly in the particular, yet their principle is good in the general, that though the Rulers ſhould beleeve him to be the Chriſt; yet they could not go along with them, ſo long as they thought they had reaſon to the contrary. 11. Errour is very dangerous and enſnaring; And albeit many may ſeeme to be led away by others into errour, yet experience will readily prove, that errour doth ſo bewitch them, as the tentation that drew them on, will not bring them off again; for, albeit they were drawn on, chiefly, by their leaders example, to oppoſe Chriſt, yet they profeſſe that though their Rulers would come off yet they will not 12. Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous perſons, and deſpiſers of Chriſt, are much foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their way, by their conceit of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and even by a pretence that they know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt, more then any beſide. Therefore, they make great boaſt of their knowledge, and particularly, of the Meſſiah whom they expected, and yet they are oppoſing him when he appeareth. 13. The not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of Scripture with Scripture, but taking any ſingle ſentence that ſeems to plead for what, we would be at, is a very great nurſery and cauſe of errour; for, ſuch is their reaſoning here, they catch at one thing ſpeaking of the Meſſiahs Divinity, and take no notice of other places with which that ſhould have been compared. 14. The right way to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures concerning Chriſt, is, to take up both theſe Scriptures which ſpeak of his humanity and voluntary humiliation, and theſe which point out his Divinitie and glory, and ſee them all accompliſhed in him; Yet diſtinctly, ſo as we are not to expect that to be verified of his manhood which is proper to his Godhead: Nor yet that his Godhead in it ſelfe ſuffered any change by the perſonal union; for, herein alſo they failed in their reaſoning, urging that what was ſaid of the Meſſiahs Godhead ſhould be verified of him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane nature. 15. It any think it ſtrange how theſe underſtanding men ſhould ſo far miſtake, ſeeing nothing was more clear and frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then whence the Meſſiah is, as man, and that in reſpect of all circumſtances, his mother, place and time of his birth, parentage, &amp;c. They would conſider, that (beſide what may be ſpoken to afterward, of their ſinning againſt light,) this people were ſo taken up with, and foſtered by their traditions, in a dreame of Chriſts outward glory &amp; pompe, that they could not heed nor underſtand any thing concerning his humiliation, how clearly ſo ever it was revealed. And of this we have a clear inſtance in the diſciples themſelves, who being taken up with the ſame dreame, could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Chriſt, when he ſpake moſt clearly of his ſufferings, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.31, 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.44, 45. and 18.31, 32, 33, 34. And it teacheth, how dangerous a phrenſie vain imaginations and deluſions are, which will ſo poſſeſſe mens mindes, that cleareſt ſun beams of truth will not be diſcerned by them, unleſſe God in mercy recover them out of the ſnare of the Devil.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt being grieved at this impudent cavil, doth reply unto it with much boldneſſe and zeal. And, 1. He declareth that however they knew him, and whence he came, yet their carriage proved that they knew not the Father that ſent him. 2. He ſubjoins that he was comforted in this, that what ever they thought of him; yet he knew that he was ſent from the Father, who is true; And, however they knew not the Father, yet he knew him, as being from him, and ſent by him into the world. For clearing this a little, conſider, 1. The great difficulty here is, how to underſtand theſe words, <hi>ye both know me, and whence I am,</hi> being compared with what followes, that they <hi>knew not</hi> the Father; for, they are taken up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, As, 1. By way of Irony and holy deriſion, as if Chriſt had ſaid; Ye think ye know me well enough, but ye know me not at all as ye ſhould, ſince ye know not the Father who ſent me, and that I am come from him. And this indeed holds true in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, That conceit is a great prop unto miſtakes and errours, and an hinderance unto cloſing with Chriſt; That mens not cloſing with Chriſt by faith, doth flow from ignorance of the Father; And, That conceit of knowledge is very hateful to Chriſt, ſeeing he doth, in an holy manner, mock it. 2. The words may be taken as declaring them to know Chriſt, and yet to be ignorant of him, but in diverſe reſpects; They knew him, and whence he was, as man, (though even in that they erred, if they ſuppoſed him to be the Carpenters Sonne;) Yet they knew not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor him, as God, proceeding from the Father, and ſent by him. And indeed, They have need to be quick ſighted, who know Chriſt as he is in truth, and they who do know much, will perceive, when they get opened eyes, that they are ignorant of far more of him. Theſe interpretations have indeed theſe truths in them, and do aggree well with the temper of the body of the Jewes, who were very ignorant. But Chriſt, zeal and indignation in this diſcourſe, (teſtified by <hi>crying</hi>) with the conſideration of theſe he ſpeaks unto, may lead us to look yet more narrowly into the words, Therefore (3) when we conſider, that Chriſt is not now dealing with the multitude, but with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the Rulers, who knew all their plots, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. with theſe who even now had been convinced in the matter of Chriſts healing the man on the Sabbath, and had therefore in great rage, ſtarted this new quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and with theſe who would have taken him, though they had no warrant from the Rulers, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. When, I ſay, we conſider theſe things, the words may run very well thus; That Chriſt chargeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that they knew him well enough, and yet againſt their light, would not acknowledge him, but delighted to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vil. And this is not ſtrange, for it was the great ſinne of the Rulers, that they ſinned againſt their light in oppoſing of Chriſt, and ſo might alſo their aſſociats. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.16. The only difficulty againſt this interpretation, is, that it ſeems not to agree with what is afterward ſaid, that they <hi>knew not him that ſent him.</hi> But ſo is alſo ſaid of the Rulers who ſinned againſt their light, that they knew not the Father nor Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.2, 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, however they knew as much as to make them guiltie of ſinning againſt light, yet they knew him not ſavingly, and their carnal conceptions concerning the Meſſiah, made them maliciouſly reject all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments that this was he, ſince they ſaw no ſatisfaction to their deſires in him. Conſider. 2. As for theſe proofes of Chriſts knowing the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. the laſt of them is clear of it ſelfe, that Chriſt being ſent Ambaſſadour from the Father, behooved to know him who ſent him, and to have ample inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and knowledge of his minde. As for the other proofe, <hi>I am from him,</hi> however it may be taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that he came from the Father, and not only ſo (for, one may come from another, and yet know little of him or his minde either) but came cloathed with a commiſſion and furniſhed with inſtructions, as his ſending imports; or, it may point out, that he did voluntarily come, as well as the Father ſent him: Yet it ſeemeth clearer, to underſtand it of his eternal generation, and being from the Father as God, and ſo it points out an higher proofe of his knowing the Father, beſide his being an Ambaſſadour. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Such is the perverſitie of men, in oppoſing Chriſt and the Goſpel, that it is hard for them who have any zeal of God to get it endured; So much did Chriſt teſtifie by his vehemency in ſpeaking to theſe, he <hi>cried in the Temple as he taught.</hi> 2. The violent, malicious, and effronted oppoſition of men ſhould not blunt nor daſh zeal, but rather ſet an edge upon it, in all theſe who would approve themſelves to have antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne; Therefore, Chriſt <hi>cries as he taught.</hi> To be calme ſo long as our particular is not touched, however God be diſhonoured, is ſtupidity and not meekneſſe, and an evidence of the want of the zeal of God. 3. Among other trials and exerciſes that Chriſt and his followers do meet within the world, from the ignorance of men and their infirmities, this is one of the chiefe, that they will have to do with men, who directly againſt their light do oppoſe him and his truth; for, ſuch did Chriſt meet with here. And it may warne men, to take heed how they ſleight and go over their light in ordinary walking, leſt, in proceſſe of time, they maliciouſly contradict their light. And to beware of engaging againſt truth, leſt they be leſt to themſelves, to run to hell before they ſtop. 4. Mens oppoſing of truth, and Chriſt, againſt their light, is not only a ſad trial to the zealous, but an horrid iniquity in it ſelfe, and will be a witneſſe for the friends of truth in the boſome of oppoſers; Therefore Chriſt not only <hi>cries</hi> againſt this, but beares their knowledge upon them, as a witneſſe for him, and an aggravation of their ſinne; <hi>ye both know me, and ye know whence I am.</hi> 5. Whatever light malicious oppoſers of Chriſt have, which will aggreage their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48148:75"/>
own guilt; yet their oppoſition proves that they have no ſaving knowledge of God nor of him; Therefore ſaith Chriſt to them, <hi>him that ſent me ye know not.</hi> Whatever light and knowledge of God men have, yet they know nothing indeed and ſavingly, but what their heart ſubmits unto and embraces, and what the Sonne reveals of him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. and what tends to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.3. 6. Such as are approven of God, ought not to be ſhaken by the miſconſtructions, and malicious oppoſitions and cavillations of men, Therefore doth Chriſt ſet forth his own grounds of comfort and aſſurance, to teſtifie that he would not be moved by all their oppoſition, nor needed a teſtimony from them. 7. Albeit the gaining and converſion of one ſoul be of more worth then a whole world; Yet it is one good end of a Miniſtry, to convince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious men, and not leave them without a witneſſe; Therefore alſo doth Chriſt aſſert his calling and commiſſion before theſe malicious men, that they might know there was not only a Prophet, but the Meſſiah among them. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.5. 8. It is a ſweet encouragement under trial, when men know they have a calling from God to what they are oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and that they do not undertake it of themſelves; for, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am not come of my ſelfe</hi> &amp;c. It not only imports, that he was indeed ſent by the Father, but holds out his ground of encouragement from his calling. And if men knew what it were to bear the burthen and conſequents of any courſe they undertake, it would make them affrayd to run without a call. 9. Such as would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eap comfort by any call from God, ſhould ſtudy much his fidelity and truth, and that whoever deſpiſe them, yet he will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard them, who employeth them; Therefore doth Chriſt ſubjoine, <hi>he that ſent me is true,</hi> to wit, in his promiſes and covenant made with him the Mediatour when he ſent him into the world, and therefore will accordingly own him in his going through his ſtate of humiliation. And this alſo is of general uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all who are called of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.24. And as men would not quit the comfort and clearneſſe of their calling, ſo they would take heed that Atheiſme do not brangle the truth of theſe promiſes made to them, in following that calling. 10. Such as would ſavingly know Chriſt, eſpecially in his ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and would not maliciouſly oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tradict any light they have, they ſhould labour to know the Father that ſent him, that ſo they may ſee better what Chriſt is, and what the hazard is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him; for, ſo much alſo is inſinuate in this challenge, <hi>he that ſent me is true, whom ye know not.</hi> Had they ſeen the Father more in Chriſt, they had not maliciouſly ſtumbled at his baſeneſſe, nor durſt they have hazarded to oppoſe him 11. Men who would cleave to and be encouraged in God, in times of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſhould not take up truths concerning him by gueſſe, but ſhould be certain of them by ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h; Therefore, doth Chriſt aſſert, <hi>I know him.</hi> 12. Whoever be ignorant of God, yet Chriſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him and his will perfectly, and is ſufficiently able to reveal him to others, who deſire to learn at him; for, ſaith he; <hi>But I know him.</hi> 13. Chriſts perfect knowledge of the Father appeareth from his eternal Godhead, that he is from the Father, and the ſame in eſſence with him, and ſo communicates with him in his eternal knowledge of himſelfe, and in his counſels; and, from his commiſſion from the Father, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that he came with full inſtructions from him; for, theſe are he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt is, that theſe enraged men, being galled with Chriſts former diſcourſe, would have taken him by violence, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did reſtrain them, becauſe his time to ſuffer was not yet come, <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The more that malicious men are dealt with and convinced, the further will they be from any good, and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperat. As here we ſee in theſe men, who raged before and now are quite mad in their fury. 2. Violence and perſecution againſt the perſons of faithful teachers, is an evidence of men that maliciouſly oppoſe truth, and the lot which is to be expected from ſuch; for, <hi>they</hi> (whom Chriſt aſſerts to have ſinned againſt their light, <hi>verſe</hi>

                     </gap>8, 29) <hi>ſought to take him,</hi> that they might kill him, or deliver him up to their Rulers. 3. It is the prerogative of God, that to him belong the iſſues from death, and that he can preſerve his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the midſt of their enemies, even when they are in the height of their rage; for, <hi>but no man laid bands on him.</hi> 4. God needs no means to preſerve his ſervants, but can ſecure them as well by an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand of providence, as if they had all vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Many a good turne are men made to do, and to omit many evil, for which they will never be rewarded as ſervice; As being not done or omitted from any principle of grace, but from an hand of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit Chriſts followers may expect, that at laſt the Lord, for wiſe reaſons, will not let the malice of men ceaſe, till they be brought to ſuffering; Yet the time thereof is in Gods hand, and not in the power of bloody men; And they may boldly go on in their lawful calling, beleeving that enemies will not anticipat his time;

                  <p>The ſecond conſequent of the former debate, (which alſo is a tranſition and introduction to the third general effect of his publike preaching) is, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the great ones were ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed, yet many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people did beleeve on him, as concluding that whoever expected another Meſſiah, yet they were ſure there would none come who could work greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then he had done; And ſo it was folly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect another. <hi>John</hi> doth not declare what theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in particular were, that affected them, only it ſeemeth they were not preſent miracles, but theſe he had done in former times: Therefore they ſay he <hi>hath done</hi> them. And as for this ground of their faith, that he wrought ſingular miracles albeit the ſcope and end of his miracles was to confirme his doctrine, and that he was the Meſſiah, and if thereby they were led not only to acknowledge him, but to reap benefit by his word and offices, they were certainly in the right way. But if they were only led and affected with his miracles, and reſted there; it was very defective; and though the power and glory of Chriſt, ſhining in his works, did effect them, yet wanting a root, it could not but ſoone fade; As many may think they have attained to ſome perfection, when yet they are indeed but to begin. They who are <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> are yet commanded to begin repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. Yet it is to be obſerved, that this and the like changes are called <hi>beleeving on him;</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they were good in themſelves, and a beginning of good, and to ſhew, that Chriſt would not have good beginnings deſpiſed by the godly, when they finde them in themſelves; even albeit hypocrites may have them, who yet fall back again; for their fault was not that they had theſe, but that they had not more, and made not progreſſe: And partly, to ſhew, that Chriſt himſelf is a very large commender and eſteemer of grace, who will give ſuch fair titles to ſmall beginnings. But leaving to determine what the change wrought on them was, we may from the <hi>verſe, Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt, when he pleaſeth, can make his work to proſper, even in the midſt of his enemies; and when they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly oppoſing, and uſing their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour againſt him, he can pluck ſome, yea many, out of their hand; for, even at this time, <hi>many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on him.</hi> 2. Albeit grace be enſured to no ſort of people more then another; yet it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the meaner ſort with whom it prevailes moſt; for, they are <hi>of the people,</hi> or, <hi>multitude,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, when the Rulers and their followers in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> are perſecuting. Men who live at eaſe and in pleaſure, ordinarily ſee little need of any thing beſide; they ſee no need of prayer or dependance on God, having all things at hand; yea, it is a wonder if they be not perſecutors. 3. Let men expect what they will, beſide Chriſt, for happineſſe; yet he is ſingular, and none can expect a better then he: So much do they acknowledge, that let men dream what they will of another Meſſiah, yet <hi>when Chriſt cometh, will he do moe miracles then theſe which this man hath done?</hi> He will indeed be found the chiefe of ten thouſand. 4. Albeit Chriſts ſervants may take much pains, whereof they ſee no preſent effects; yet God may bleſſe theſe ſame labours with ſucceſſe afterward; for, the miracles which Chriſt <hi>hath done</hi> before, do now take effect with ſome.</p>

In this <hi>ver.</hi> is related, that the mutterings of the people, in favour of Chriſt, coming to the Phariſees eares, they, with the chiefe Prieſts ſend ſome officers to apprehend him. Albeit there was by right but one high Prieſt at once, yet here are mentioned moe <hi>chiefe Prieſts,</hi> belike they were the heads of theſe twenty foure courſes, or orders of Prieſts, of which we read, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. or the high Prieſt and his deputy, who acted many things under him, and did officiate for him, when he was legally unclean. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Some may attain to a meaſure of reſpect to Chriſt, who yet have not attained to a competency of courage, to avow it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in times of hazard; for, the people did but <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure ſuch things concerning him.</hi> 2. Even in ſocieties where many countenance the Goſpel, and where they carry themſelves moſt cautiouſly, there may ſtill ſome be found who are but ſpies and obſervers in behalfe of perſecutors; for, here where many beleeved, and did but <hi>murmure</hi> theſe things, the matter is brought to the Phariſees ears, who were the moſt ſtrict ſect, and moſt rigide againſt Chriſt. 3. Chriſts riſing glory, and his ſucceſſe in the Goſpel, will enrage enemies, and draw on trouble; for, they who were taxed of ſlackneſſe before, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. when they hear of his ſucceſſe, and that men begin to commend him, they could bear it no longer; though indeed they came too late to quench that fire, ſeeing trouble will never ſeparate Chriſt and them that truely beleeve. It is true, indeed, that God will ſometime give a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, ſome breathings of tranquility, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31, and will ſend perſecution to rowze up his people

from ſecurity; But ordinarily, it is little apparent ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, and little prejudice done to Satans kingdome, that makes him and his inſtruments quiet. 4. Bloody and violent perſecution is the laſt refuge of hypocrites, and that which may be expected from them, when they are vexed; for, they uſe no other arguments, but <hi>ſent officers to take him,</hi> that they might bring him before their Judicatory, whereof yet they retained ſome name and ſhaddow. When Satan and his inſtruments come to this, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they are indeed vexed, and at their laſt gaſp. 5. Chriſt is the great Butt of perſecutors ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; who as he let his followers get few or no blaſts while he was in the world; So he ſtands ſtill on the head of them who ſight under his banner, and will reckon with perſecutors, as they who would poure out all the hatred they let out on his people, on him only, if he were within their reach; for, here we ſee their diſpoſition, who <hi>ſent to take him</hi> only, not troubling the Profeſſours;</p>

The ſumme of it is; That however they thought him a thorn in their ſide, and that they would never be well till he were gone; Yet he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the time appointed him, and then he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Father. But they needed not be ſo earneſt, for they would want him but too ſoone, and ſhould not finde him, though they would gladly have him. So that this doctrine contains not only a conſolation which Chriſt takes unto himſelfe, that he would be preſerved from their fury till his hour was come, and then would returne unto his Father, where he would be without their reach: But a threatning alſo againſt the perſecutors. For albeit the ſame be alſo ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 33. yet in different ſenſes; for though the outward ſeparation was the ſame, yet his heart was diverſly affected toward them; The ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the one was but for a time, and in part only; but the others, perpetual, and total, as is to be cleared in its own place. Here the meaning is, that they would want him but too ſoone, and he being gone, in their enſueing calamities, they ſhould miſſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah, but finde none, ſince they ſought another then him. And though they would be glad of him, yet they ſhould not be able to finde or come to him in heaven, ſeeing they underſtood not ſpiritual ſeeking, and wanted faith, whereby to obtain acceſſe. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It beſeemeth Chriſts followers, not to be moved with dangers, but rather to be affected with pity toward perſecutors, and to warne them of their danger; for, ſo doth Chriſt here; He is not daunted with the coming of theſe officers, but preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es out his own encouragements, and their hazard to them. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23, 24. <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.14, 15. 2. It is but folly for perſecutors to think to gain their point by violence, or to put away Chriſt and his truth, for they will not be rid of him till he have done his work, but ſo long as he pleaſeth, he will ſtay, and vexe them more who are already angry enough; Therefore, ſaith he, notwithſtanding their great haſt, <hi>yet awhile am I with you.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31, 32, 33. 3. Men have little cauſe to be weary of Chriſt, nor need they ſeek to put him away by violence and perſecution, for their contempt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt him, and their not making uſe of him, will cauſe him to go away but too ſoone; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he to them, it is but <hi>yet a little while I am with you,</hi> being now near the end of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and ſo he tels them they would have him but too ſhort while. 4, When perſecutors are doing their utmoſt, yet it is but a little while that Chriſt and his followers will be troubled with them, for death will put an end to the worſt of it; So much alſo is imported in this, <hi>yet a little while I am with you, and then I go, &amp;c.</hi> 5. While Chriſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his violent death and ſufferings in theſe termes, <hi>I go, &amp;c.</hi> he not onely imports that he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underwent that death, otherwiſe none of them had power over his life, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. But alſo teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his followers not to be ſtrangers unto death, nor to look even upon a violent death for truth, in theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours wherein ſenſe would preſent it, but to be ſo familiar with death, and dwelling on thoughts of mortality that they may willingly cloſe with it, when they get a call, and ſay, <hi>I go.</hi> 6.

See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2.3, 4 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be ſufficient matter of comfort to the godly, that God can, and when he pleaſeth, will preſerve them in the midſt of dangers; yet it addes to their comfort, that the day cometh, wherein they will be viſibly above the reach of all their enemies, and be made to triumph over them; for, ſo much alſo is held out here in Chriſts encouragement, that when he is gone, he would be above their fury, and they ſhould not reach him, though they would. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55. 8. Greateſt deſpiſers of Chriſt may be made to miſſe and deſire him, when he is gone; for, ſaith he, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me.</hi> Not onely ſhall many of them deſire to have him to perſecute, but to no purpoſe (as is ſaid before;) but in the enſuing calamities, they would earneſtly long for, and deſire their Meſſiah, to be a comfort unto them. 9. There are many who may earneſtly ſeek after Chriſt, who yet, in Gods judgement, ſhall never finde him; for, <hi>ye ſhall ſeeke me, and ſhall not find me.</hi> See <hi>Amos</hi> 5.11, 12. For not onely was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire too late, now when he is gone, (and ſeldome is ſuch a deſire ſincere) But. 1. They failed in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48148:77"/>
ſeeking their Meſſiah in general, continuing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him, and perſecute him in his members; and ſo many pretend to love piety, when it is ſpoken of in a general notion, and yet do perſecute it, when they ſee particular effects of it in any. 2. They failed in deſiring a Meſſiah bodily preſent with them, when now he is gone to heaven. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they reap the juſt fruit of their deſpiſing him, when they had him among them, and of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpoſitions, that could not aſcend by faith to him, if they had acknowledged him to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. 3. They failed in their end in deſiring the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, not that he might expiate their ſin and being in everlaſting righteouſneſſe, but onely that he might deliver them from trouble, and make them proſper under him in the world. And therefore it is juſt, that ſuch ſeekers come no ſpeed, how earneſt however they ſeem to be. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 10. Such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not Chriſts company, where they are, in this life, are juſtly ſecluded from coming to be where he is; for, therefore ſaith he to theſe who would perſecute him from among them; <hi>where I am, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye cannot come.</hi> Not onely ſhall they be denied acceſſe in their ſeeking, but ſhall be ſecluded for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from his, and his peoples bleſſed ſociety.</p>

It ſeemes they carp thus, not out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for they might eaſily have underſtood what he ſpake ſo plainly, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. of going to him that ſent him: But they evidence their perverſity and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, in that they never trouble themſelves to keep him, nor propound any thing to him for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but do onely agitate the matter captiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Such is the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of malicious men, that they will not onely not regard admonitions and threatnings, but will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſcorne them and wilfully miſtake, and force obſcurity upon the doctrine of faithful Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may deride them; for, ſo did they here with Chriſt and his doctrine. 2. Men do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray their own corrupt diſpoſitions, pretend what they will, when they dare carp and cavil at doctrine, as dark and unclear, and yet never come to Chriſt, or the means he hath appointed, for reſolution; for, albeit they once, and again, repeat his words, and deſcant upon them, and carp at them, yet they ſaid it but <hi>among themſelves,</hi> and ſo prove that they deſired no: ſatisfaction, but were glad of ſomewhat to quarrel. 3. It is alſo a black mark upon men, (be their pretences what they will,) when they are little careful to keep Chriſt with them, or to make uſe of him while they have him; for, what ever they pretend of obſcurity in his doctrine, yet they avow it clearly enough, that they underſtood he was to leave them, and yet are not affected with it. 4. It is the ordinary ſin of a priviledged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they will not be ſenſible of any hazard of Chriſts forſaking and leaving them; for, while they enquire <hi>whither will he go?</hi> they inſinuate that if he were the true Meſſiah, he could get no ſuch people as them to go to, and if he went to the <hi>diſperſed among the Gentiles,</hi> (or <hi>Greeks,</hi> as the Gentiles are oft-times called in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Greeks, under <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſucceſſors, had been lately of greateſt note among the Nations) <hi>and teach the Gentiles,</hi> it would rub more on him, as not being the true Meſſiah who left them, then upon them. And yet not onely did what they apprehended come upon them (for he left them, and ſent his diſciples to the Gentiles, and theſe ſcattered Jewes, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> wrote their Epiſtles) but even what they ſay, was a refutation of their preſumption. For the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their diſperſed brethren was a witneſſe and evidence of what they all deſerved, and how much pains God had taken to drive them from that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conceit of their ſingular priviledges and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</p>

after ſpiritual things; Yet it doth not ſeclude, but ſuch as thirſt, even after other things, ſhould come to him, who alone is able to anſwer their expectation, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. While as Chriſt returns no anſwer to their malicious carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>verſe</hi> 35, 36. but makes this large offer, to all of them, or, at leaſt, to ſuch as would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and come; It teacheth, partly, that meek Chriſt will follow, even deſpiſers, with his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers, and will digeſt all their effronted debor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, if at laſt they will embrace him. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he is ſo earneſt, and ſo buſie, when there is an opportunity to offer and do good to any, that he will not care to give his enemies the laſt word of him, and will ſay to them as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid in another caſe to the man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.14. <hi>I may not tarry thus with thee?</hi> 2. Opportunity may ſeeme ſtrangely to ſlip away and be loſt, as to getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good done, even when not onely faithful men, but Chriſt himſelf is about the managing of the work of the Goſpel; for, now it is come to <hi>the laſt day, the great day of the feast,</hi> (as both the firſt and laſt were holy convocations, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.34, 35, 36) and the people, after eight dayes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, are ready to go away, before they cloſe with his offer. 3. Opportunities ſhould be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully managed, that they are ſhortly like to paſſe over; Therefore doth Chriſt beſtir himſelf on this <hi>laſt day.</hi> 4. When people are ready to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſolemne exerciſes and Aſſemblies, to their ordinary employments and vocations, they have need to have their hearts ſeaſoned and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with uſeful inſtructions; Therefore doth Chriſt publiſh this needful doctrine on that day, that it might beat them company home. 5. Albeit Chriſt be alwayes rich and good unto his people; yet it is his ordinary way, to bleſſe eminent and ſolemne times of his peoples worſhip, with much of him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth he make <hi>that great day of the feaſt,</hi> yet greater, by his ſweet Sermon and offer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon it. 6. The truth of God, and riches of Chriſt ought to be proclaimed with ſuch courage, fervency, and zeal, as becomes ſuch a meſſage, and as may invite hearers to take notice of it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus <hi>flood</hi> (whereas the uſe then was to ſit and teach) <hi>and cried,</hi> not onely that he might be ſeen and heard in that great croud, but to teſtifie his courage when they ſent to kill him, and his fervent zeal to have this doctrine beleeved and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. 7. Man is a barren and all-needy creature, burnt up with wants and neceſſities, and not able to ſupply them of himſelf; for, ſo much doth their <hi>thirſting</hi> import, that they are burnt up, and muſt have ſomewhat without them, to coole and refreſh them. 8. There is no ſatisfaction for empty man in any courſe he takes, till he come to Chriſt, and embrace and cloſe with him. Neither will the world and things therein ſatisfie their expectation, who luſt after theſe things; Nor will external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ſatisfie them who have any true thirſt: for, this is the onely remedy, <hi>Let him come unto me.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. 9. As men are bound to have ſpiritual thirſt after Chriſt, that they may be ſatisfied; and as Chriſt will ſatisfie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh ſuch: So he doth allow and invite all theſe who have eſſayed many courſes, but in vain, to come to him, and finde what they want; for, both are comprehended here, <hi>if any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> For clearing and enlarging whereof, Conſider, 1. Chriſt is ſo condeſcending, that he will not refuſe, even theſe who have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred far, ſeeking contentment, before they would come to him; but will take up a man, after he hath been refuſed at all other doores, and him who hath ſpent his ſtrength for that which is no bread, and drunk many a puddle dry, and yet is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. 2. It is no matter what a man hath been before, ſo now he be driven to Chriſt, having eſſayed the vanity of all things beſide; <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man thirſt, let him come;</hi> And albeit the thirſt of many after other things hath been ſinful and diſhonourable to Chriſt, yet he will accept of them, if they come: Yea, albeit they want many things that are required in ſuch as come; yet he will make them welcome, if they come to get theſe things. 3. Albeit ſpiritual thirſt and indigencie, when it is diſcovered, be a very humbling condition; Yet it ſhould be looked on as Chriſts forerunner, and as an invitation, call, and warrant, put in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties hand, that he may come; for, <hi>if any man thirſt,</hi> it ſaith from Chriſt, <hi>let him come to me.</hi> 4. Albeit thirſt be nothing elſe but a diſcovery, and a making of us ſenſible of our neceſſity; Yet it is Chriſts way, to take no other advantage of his peoples neceſſity, then to let out of his fulneſſe to them, and let them ſee that it is indeed their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and (in ſome reſpect) matter of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, to dwell in the ſenſe of emptineſſe; for, he giveth <hi>thirſt,</hi> that he may give <hi>drink;</hi> And therefore his keeping of his people at under ought not to be ſtumbled at. 5. The propounding of this condition, <hi>if any man thirſt,</hi> is not to be underſtood, as if we muſt firſt beget ſenſe of need in our ſelves, and then come to Chriſt; Nor doth it warrant any ſouls who would be at Chriſt, to ſeclude themſelves, becauſe they think they are not thirſty: for, albeit it do point out what is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Yet it is his work to beget it, who ſends his work before him, that he may bring his reward with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.10. and who by offering of grace, as a mean, doth oft-times beget it. But the ſcope is rather to invite men to come, upon this ground, that if they come indeed, they do, by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prove they have thirſt, whatever they think of themſelves; and that any who are come this length, that they would come if they had thirſt, they may come with what they have, and get more thirſt by coming to him. Therefore are all theſe conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal offers ſummed up in this, <hi>whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. 6. It is Chriſts will, that thirſty ſouls ſhould not onely come to him by humble dependance, but that they ſhould enlarge themſelves and partake of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and his refreſhments; that ſo they may be ſatisfied and acquieſce in him; may confirme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their choice of him, and forſaking other delights; and, may refute their own tentations and unbelief, by taſting how good he is; for, it is his

Becauſe albeit a needy ſoul ſhould be ſtripped of all things beſide, yet that will be no warrant to caſt away confidence, but they muſt cheriſh it ſo much the more. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 2. As we are to reſt upon no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, as ſure, but what is recorded and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture; So it may encourage men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, that in him, and by him, we are ſure to finde the accompliſhment of all that the Scripture promiſeth; for; he maketh here a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that it ſhall be with beleevers, <hi>as the Scripture hath ſaid.</hi> 3. He doth not name the particular Scripture, not onely becauſe there are many of them, (as hath been ſaid) and he would have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtudy and ſearch them all out, that they may ſee the fulneſſe of the promiſe; But further, by this he would teach, that he would have his people well acquainted with Scripture, that they may know where the promiſes are to be found; Therefore doth he onely name the Scripture in general, here and elſewhere, onely <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. we finde the Pſalme quoted. 4. It may encourage us to ſtudy much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Scripture, that the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, and of Chriſts riches, are treaſured up and held forth, even in the writings of the Old Teſtament; Therefore alſo when Chriſt maketh his richeſt offers, he needs ſay no more, but that he will do <hi>as the Scripture bath ſaid.</hi> The ſumme of all Religion is comprehended in the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore Chriſt doth prove, even the reſurrection, out of them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 31, 32, The Prophets are Gods own Commentary upon theſe, and the application of the doctrine thereof unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions of men in ſeveral times: and the New Teſtament is a clear unveiling of <hi>Moſes</hi> face, and holds out the accompliſhment of what he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed. 5. Such as out of ſenſe of need, come to Chriſt, will not onely finde ſome particular refreſhment or for awhile onely, but they will get a fountain to be in them; for, it is not a drink only to cool them in this or that particular thirſt, but a <hi>river</hi> put in them to <hi>flow out.</hi> They get a ſeed of God to abide in them. 6. Chriſts Spirit, and the refreſhments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are ſo communicate unto beleevers as they take deep root in them; for they are in <hi>their belly,</hi> or their heart, or very inward parts, where meat is ſwallowed down to be digeſted into our ſubſtance. And this doth difference it not onely from prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick illumination, which came upon men from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and which a <hi>Balaam</hi> may have; But from the motions that came upon rotten-hearted ſinners, who for all they get, yet continue dark in themſelves like the Moon. 7. The Lords allowance to his people is very liberal and bountiful, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient to ſatisfie them; for, albeit the great Ocean of refreſhment abide ſtill in himſelf, yet he lets out unto them no leſſe then a <hi>river,</hi> yea and <hi>rivers,</hi> every grace flowing out like a river, as is ſaid of peace. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. 8. The Spirit of Chriſt doth remain and abide perpetually in beleevers, to whom he is given; for theſe are <hi>rivers of living water,</hi> not only becauſe they are ſtill freſh and make lively, but becauſe they are a ſpring, which doth perpetually flow out, and run, and therefore is called <hi>living. Gen.</hi> 26.19 in the Original. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8. And this doth difference it from the wickeds puddle, which doth runne dry, and from what the temporary receiveth. And albeit the regenerate man finde many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions of the refreſhments of this ſpring, through his own pride, unbelief, and idleneſſe; yet the fountain remaineth ſtill, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. 9. Where the Spirit and the graces thereof are received by a beleever, and entertained by faith, the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof will ſlow forth for the refreſhing of themſelves and others in their ſtations, and that with much refreſhment and life; for, the <hi>rivers of living waters ſhall flow,</hi> and that <hi>out of his belly,</hi> which is the ſeat of delight, <hi>Job</hi> 20.15. As a ſpring ſends forth ſtreames to water the ground about it, and as the heart of man ſendeth forth life and refreſhment to every faculty and member, and as a General in an army ſends out reſerves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce his parties; So graces of the the Spirit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers will flow forth into their behaviour and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to make their heart be ſtrong, to make their tongue to drop what is ſavoury, to make their feet like hindes feet, &amp;c. and to refreſh and gain ground upon others.</p>

                  <p>Here we have <hi>Johns</hi> commentary upon this laſt promiſe; who, belike, not underſtanding this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; (as they were ignorant of many things) till Chriſt was riſen from the dead, doth now take pains to clear others who might be in the like condition. He declareth that by this living water is meant the Spirit and graces thereof, which beleevers were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to receive, the giving whereof was ſuſpended till the glorification of Chriſt the head of beleevers. This began in that ſolemne day, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and doth continue ſtill throughout all ages of the Church. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. As the doctrine of Chriſt in Scripture doth oft times need to be interpreted, becauſe of our ſhallow capacity; So the beſt Commentary upon Scripture, is it ſelfe, and the comparing of one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with another; for, <hi>John</hi> by this expoſition, doth not only expreſſe his ſimpathy with theſe who might, poſſibly, be in the ſame condition that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he was; but doth point out the ſafe way of expounding Scripture, and ſheweth that it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it ſelfe. 2. Whatſoever vertue is in water, for cleanſing of filth, for cooling and refreſhing the thirſty, and fructifying of barren ground; And whatever is promiſed in Scriptures, under the Metaphor of waters, is all to be found in a ſpiritual way, in receiving of the Spirit and graces thereof by faith; for, ſo is here explained, <hi>But this he ſpake of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> compare, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 10, 13, 14. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8. 3. While he ſaith, <hi>beleevers ſhould receive the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit was not yet given,</hi> or, <hi>was not yet,</hi> (not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his perſonal ſubſiſtence, but in reſpect of the meaſure of his gifts and graces to be poured out upon beleevers) it doth relate, partly, to the times of the law, and teacheth, That albeit beleevers under the law did partake of the Spirit in ſome meaſure, yet all that is nothing in compariſon of that meaſure which is poured out under the Goſpel; In that reſpect <hi>the holy Ghoſt was not yet given,</hi> which may ſhame them who make not uſe of their ample allowance, but do, under the Goſpel, come far ſhort of many who lived under the Pedagogie of the law. Partly, it relates to the preſent condition of the diſciples, and his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, who were not yet endued with power from on high, and therefore were but weak and ignorant in many things. And it teacheth, That were men even in Chriſts company, yet they will not profit much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit. 4. It pleaſed our bleſſed and glorious Lord to abaſe himſelfe, by undergoing a ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, till he perfected the work of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, ſo is here imported, and in this reſpect the Lord of glory <hi>was not yet glorified,</hi> but continued under the vail of his ſtate of humiliation. 5. The pouring out of the Spirit in ample meaſure, as, in the wiſdome of God, reſerved till the glorification of Chriſt as Mediatour, that ſo the proportion might be kept betwixt the head and the members; for, <hi>the holy Ghoſt was not yet given</hi> to beleevers, becauſe, <hi>that Chriſt was not yet glorified.</hi> And as our bleſſed Lord did once abaſe himſelfe ſo far, as beleevers muſt be kept back from their allowance, till he, who was a worme and not a man, be glorified; So we may expect that he will not reſt, till we come up to ſhare with him, now that he is exalted: And we ſhould be content to ſtoop and ſhare with him in the ſad ſufferings of his cauſe and intereſts, expecting that when he exalts himſelfe in it, he will reſpect the deſolate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16, 17. And we having now to do with an exalted Lord, ſhould expect much from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. and 5.31. 6. While as under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is comprehended, all that pouring out of the Spirit which followed upon the glorification of Chriſt, and theſe gifts in the primitive times, among the reſt, as a peculiar inſtance, The meaning is not to put the ſaving graces of the Spirit, conferred upon belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in the ſame rank with theſe extraordinary gifts that were conferred upon ſome temporary beleevers then; Nor yet is it the meaning, that beleevers now ſhould expect the ſame fruits of the Spirit for kinde, that were conferred on ſome beleevers then; But it tends to ſhew: That the ſaving graces of the Spirit are as excellent (and more) then many gifts that had a greater luſtre, and the promiſe is richly fulfilled when men get theſe, albeit they want the other; That albeit all beleevers do not work the like viſible wonders with the Apoſtles, yet by the receiving of the Spirit, as great wonders are wrought upon themſelves in a ſpiritual way; for, thereby the dead are quickened, the deafe made to heare, the blinde to ſee, the lame to leap, the withered made freſh, and they get new tongues to ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not before; And, That their way of carriage and deportment, who received the holy Ghoſt in theſe primitive times, ſhould be a pattern to all theſe who would prove that they do now partake of the Spirit.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48148:80"/>In theſe verſes, we have the effects of this Sermon among the hearers, ſome are ſo affected with it, that they acknowledge him to be that great Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 18.18. whom they underſtood to be another then the Meſſiah; Others do confeſſe him to be the Chriſt; but others oppoſe againſt that, that he (as they ſuppoſed came out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> whereas according to the Scriptures, the Meſſiah was to come out of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> And upon this diverſitie of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, there ariſeth a ſchiſme and diviſion among them: But there are ſome ſo violent, that they will diſpute none but with their hands, and yet are impeded. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Chriſts doctrine will not want effects among hearers, but will either gain ground upon them, or put them to diſquiet, debate, and vexation. As here we ſee. 2. Schiſme and diviſion is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſequent that followes upon the preaching of the Goſpel; Not through the Goſpels fault, but by reaſon of the divers tempers of men, unto whom it is preached; for, <hi>there was a diviſion among the people becauſe of him.</hi> 3. Diverſity of opinions in matters of Religion, is a mean and occaſion of diviſions and rentings among a people; for, it was upon their different apprehenſions concerning him, that this <hi>diviſion</hi> aroſe <hi>among the people.</hi> 4. Mens ignorance, or not right underſtanding or taking up of the truth, and one of another, may breed diviſion, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be an agreement; for, they who ſaid, <hi>of a truth this is the Prophet,</hi> and they who ſaid, <hi>this is the Chriſt,</hi> did in effect agree; for he is a Prophet, and that is one of his offices as Meſſiah, to be that great Prophet of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. And yet their own miſtakes, in conceiving that theſe two were different, bred a diviſion betwixt them. 5. Men may be much affected with Chriſt and his excellency, who yet come far ſhort of the truth of what is in him, and who do not come to him as a Saviour; for, when they are affected with him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yet they come far ſhort, and do not ſee him to be <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> 6. As for theſe who acknowledged him to be the Chriſt, we may either conceive that they did but ſee him to be ſo, but yet made no uſe of him; As indeed, the conviction of many doth produce but ſmall, or no effects: Or, that they were indeed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and yet no more mention is made of them; For the Lord ſeeth it ſitting, oft-times, to bury the memory of many of his dear children in ſilence, who yet are no leſſe honeſt then theſe who are more famous. Thus albeit the Lord did chooſe <hi>Matthias,</hi> Act. 1.23, 26. and that rather then <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom it ſeems the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preferred to him, and therefore mention him firſt; Yet it pleaſed him never to regiſtrate a word more of him. And by this he would teach, That to be famous, and in an account in the world, or noted among profeſſours, is not the great buſineſſe in Religion, nor that which the truely ſincere will make much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. 7. Miſtakes and ignorance are a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, to the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel; This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not only in them who miſtooke the prediction concerning the Prophet, as if he were to be another then the Meſſiah; But in theſe alſo (either the ſame or other perſons) who being indeed acquainted with the Scriptures which make mention of Chriſts linage, and the place of his birth, are yet ignorant of the truth about Chriſts nativity, ſuppoſing that he was of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> becauſe he was educate and reſided moſt there: <hi>Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee? Hath not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid that Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was,</hi> which indeed was true in it ſelfe, and true of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1. though they were ignorant and miſtook him. 8. Men are oft-times exceeding guilty in the matter of their own ignorance, becauſe they do ſo affect it, and do not ſearch for knowledge, but rather delight to have ſomewhat to cavil at; for, ſuch was their way here; as they knew from Scripture where Chriſt ſhould be borne, ſo they might eaſily have been cleared of their doubt, if they had enquired at himſelf, his mother, or diſciples, but they deſire to cavil and ſhew their wit againſt him, 9. There are ſome men ſo brutiſh in their violence againſt Chriſt, that his faireſt offers, and his reſpect among others, do but ſet them on edge againſt him; for, after this ſweet preaching, and after that ſome were affected, <hi>ſome of them would have taken him.</hi> 10. The Lord, in his wiſe providence, doth ſo order, that many who are very eager to wrong Chriſt and his followers, ſhall yet want power to do it; for, <hi>but no man laid hands on him,</hi> which followed not from any natural conſcience or reverence in them toward him, but from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling and reſtraining power of God.</p>

to do their affairs for them, were <hi>officers,</hi> and therefore no wonder they employ them againſt Chriſt, to bring him before them by force. 2. The Lords providence is alſufficient, when he pleaſeth, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his fierceſt enemies, and to make them maſſe their errands and purpoſes; for, the Meſſengers return without ſucceſſe. 3. As it is a great evidence of mens pride, when they think nothing ſhould ſtand in their way, and they do rage, when they are diſappointed. So the Lord ſeeth it meet to vexe perſecutors, and to make their own confident creatures grieve them; for, by reaſon of their diſappointment, they are in a rage, and do power it out upon their own ſervants, who did not ſerve their ends well enough, <hi>Why have ye not brought him?</hi> 4.

                     </gap>e Rulers would not hear Chriſt, and their case was to hinder any from hearing him, and now they are made to hear their own officers preach of him in their own defence. 5. As Chriſts doctrine is ſingular, far above the law; So alſo was he ſingular in his way of it, for authority, humility, grace, power, and evidence; for, ſo do the officers confeſſe of him, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> they never heard a Scribe preach in that manner, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.28, 29. 6. Such is the power of Chriſts doctrine, that even ſuch as come unto it with a prejudice, and with a purpoſe to perſecute the Meſſengers thereof, may be taken by it themſelves, and if not converted, yet bridled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; for, this is the reaſon why they brought him not, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were bound up and had no power to meddle with him. And albeit there be no great evidence of their converſion, (for many may like preaching, and it have ſtrange effects on them, who yet are for from God; and belike, if they had been indeed converted, they would hardly have returne with any account;) Yet Chriſt can, and hath converted, even ſuch: And it doth ſpeak his praiſe, that by the means of ſpiritual preaching, he can reſtrain mens fury, when yet they are not really converted, nor their heart changed.</p>

It is nothing ſtrange to ſee eminent men, for authoritie and parts, ſo puffed up with their own grandour, and with a conceit of their own learning and knowledge, that they will not ſtoop to Chriſt, nor embrace him; for, they confeſſe that not <hi>any of the Rulers</hi> (or Governours of the Jewes) <hi>or of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> (their eminent ſect, though not all of them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) <hi>have beleeved on him.</hi> 7.

Chriſt, when he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, can give perſecutors more work then they can overtake, and raiſe up ſo many witneſſes for himſelfe, that they will hardly know how to refute them all; for, before they have done with the officers, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gives a new teſtimony. 2. God can turn perſecutors looſe, even where they think they are ſureſt, and raiſe difference of judgement, even where they bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their unitie; for, they uſe it as a ſtrong argument to their followers, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. that the Rulers are all againſt Chriſt, and now they are refuted by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler. 3. Such as are but infirme and weak, may yet get courage in a time of need, to ſpeak for Chriſt; And albeit true faith may lie long lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it is beſet with the centation of a great place; Yet Chriſt can draw it out when he needs it; for, <hi>Nicodemus, who came to Jeſus by night, (Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) dare now ſay ſome-what in Council for him; and albeit yet he do not openly avow him, but only pleads for that which is due to the greateſt malefactour; yet it is taken by them as a teſtimony to Chriſt, and afterward we will finde him appear better. Chriſt will not want witneſſes, ſo long as there is a timorous <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a politick <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> yea, or an Ethnick <hi>Pilate,</hi> to employ. 4. Albeit the hazard of ill company be but too diſcernably, in many who converſe with them; and albeit where the Lord gives a calling, the overcoming of that one difficulty of departing from reſpect and accommodations, would prevent many tentations that follow on ſtaying; Yet it is not the will of God, that men abandon a lawful ſtation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the corruptneſſe of theſe who are employed with them in it; Nor yet that they ſhould quit their ſtation in a Church judica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For this Council was Gods ancient Ordinance, and the Church of the Jewes was yet a true Church, and the Rulers, how corrupt ſoever, were men in lawful Eccleſiaſtical office. And elſewhere, it is not beleeving Rulers fault, that they were Rulers, but that they wronged Chriſt by their ſilence in their ſtation. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. 5. It is the lot of Chriſt and his followers, to meet with much partiality and foule play in the world, ſo that they will not be allowed the faire juſtice that is not denyed even to malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; for, ſo doth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Apology import, that they would <hi>judge him before they hear him, and know what he doth,</hi> which is not only contrary to the Word, but to all equity in any procedure, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that Judges ſhould hear parties, and be clearly ſatisfied in matter of fact, before they proceed to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.

It is a token of fury in men, and of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48148:81"/>
their rage againſt Chriſt, that when any plead for him, they are not anſwered in reaſon, but their perſons are reflected on; for, ſo do they anſwer <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his rational exception, <hi>Art thou alſo of Galilee?</hi> 3. It is alſo the way of perſecutors, to bear down truth, by making falſe and untrue grounds paſſe for currant; for, ſuch are their reaſonings here, <hi>Search and look, for out of Galilee ariſeth no Prophet.</hi> Where they lay down two falſe principles; one was, that Chriſt came out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> whereas indeed he was born in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and the other was, that ſuppoſe it had been true that no Prophet had hitherto ariſen out of <hi>Galilee;</hi> yet it would not follow that none ſhould ever ariſe out of it. 4. It is very great injuſtice, to rub reproaches upon whole provinces of people within the viſible Church, and particularly, to account of them as ſecluded from the participation of the gifts of Gods grace, which are freely beſtowed according to his pleaſure; for, herein they ſaile, not only that they reproach the whole province of <hi>Galilee,</hi> (a practice like to which did once breed great trouble, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.4.) but that they would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all of them from being ever capable of that gift of prophecy. 5. There is no council nor underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Chriſt, but when he pleaſeth, he can diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate all of it; for, here, <hi>every man went to his own houſe,</hi> without doing any thing. And albeit he take not alwayes this mean of making their councils diſſolve without concluſion; yet we may be certain that if they get permiſſion to conclude, yet they ſhall never get their concluſions, put in execution; or if they do execute them, yet they ſhall be far from the end which they propoſe to themſelves to attain thereby, which is, the ſubverſion of Chriſt, his Kingdome, and truth. 6. When God hath the conſpiracies of men againſt Chriſt to diſſipate, he needs not many probable means to effectuate it, but can cauſe the ſpeaking of one word ſerve the turne, to break the ſnare; for, upon <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> word, this followeth, <hi>every man went to his own houſe.</hi>

Having ſpent the night there, he returnes to the Temple, and finding the people ſtock about him, he teaches them, Who theſe hearers were, whether the people that were now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depart on this day after the feaſt, (for whoſe cauſe Chriſt returns ſo early) or, the multitude of the in habitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not much material. Only it ſeems that they were of the common ſort, and few or none of the Rulers. And as for his geſture in teaching, that <hi>he ſate down,</hi> it was their cuſtome in theſe times, and a teſtimony of the reſpect that is due to them that carry the minde of God; and we finde Chriſt ſometime preach ſitting, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.20, 21. ſometime ſtanding, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37 and at this time his wearineſſe with night watching might call for it. Nor is it much to be ſtood upon, which of theſe geſtures men uſe in preaching; But Preachers ought in theſe things accommodate themſelves to ſeek the benefit of hearers, and that they be heard and ſeen by them. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee Chriſt and his followers, for all their faithful ſervices in an ingrate world, yet wanting any comfortable accommodations in it: for, after Chriſt hath ſpent the day time in teaching, he wants a ſafe and convenient place to retire unto, within the Citie, and muſt go out <hi>to the Mount of Olive.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 9.58. 2. It is the duty of Chriſts Servants and people, not to reſt ſatisfied with any publike and open performances in Gods ſervice; But they ſhould alſo joyne therewith a conſcientious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the duty of ſecret prayer: which is not only needful in Miniſters, that they may draw down bleſſings upon their endeavours, but in all the godly alſo; that it may be a witneſſe of their ſincerity, and a mean of keeping up communion with Chriſt, and of preventing much anxietie: Therefore Chriſt, after
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48148:82"/>
his preaching all day, goes to prayer in <hi>the Mount of Olives.</hi> 3. As the ſinnes of the Elect deprived Chriſt of many a nights ſleep, that ſo he might ſanctifie reſt and ſleep to his beloved, (whereof this paſſage is one inſtance) So they who are ſervent in following after communion with God, will rather take their ſleeping time, then they ſhould want an opportunitie of ſecret prayer; As here Chriſts practice doth teach. 4. As the general calling of Chriſtianity is a very throng task, wherein a man needs never want an opportunity of doing ſervice to God, Yet without prejudice to his outward calling and occupation; So in particular, a Miniſters task is very great, and preaching and prayer, and the duties of his calling following thereupon, may take up his whole time, if he be faithful: As here Chriſts practice doth teach, who having ſpent the night in prayer, <hi>early in the morning came againe into the Temple and taught.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. 5. As Chriſt can get hearers to himſelfe, when he pleaſeth, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to do good, even in deſpight of all his enemies; So affection to Chriſt, and his doctrine, will ſtand upon no impediment that would ſtop the way: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, albeit it was yet early, and the Rulers were raging againſt Chriſt; yet <hi>all the people came unto him.</hi> 6. Where affection is kindled, and drawes men to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chriſts company, they will be ſure of a meeting, and to be taught by him: Therefore, albeit he might juſtly have a great quarrel againſt that Citie; Yet ſince affection drew the people, he could not refuſe them, but <hi>ſat down, and taught them.</hi>

                  <p>Followeth the hiſtory it ſelfe: wherein, firſt, (in theſe verſes) we have the caſe propounded to Chriſt by the Scribes and Phariſees, who while he is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do preſent a woman taken in the act of adultery unto him, and pointing out what was determined in <hi>Moſes</hi> law, they do in an inſinuating way ask his judgement, only that they might take ſome advantage of him by his anſwer. For, if he ſhould, according to his wonted offers of clemency aſſoile her, they would condemne him as contrary to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and if he condemned her to die, then they thought to make him odious to the people, as contradicting his own practice, in eating with Publicans and ſinners, and his Doctrine, in offering mercy and grace ſo freely. We need not be inquiſitive why they preſent only the woman, though it be probable, that however they were taken in the very act, yet the man had eſcaped from among their hands. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 1. Chriſts ſervants ought not to think it ſtrange, when they get not through ſpiritual duties with eaſe, but do meet with many temptations and interruptions in them; for, Chriſt himſelfe was interrupted by theſe wicked men; They <hi>brought in a woman taken in adultery,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It gives juſt ground of ſuſpition, when men, who were violent enemies, do on a ſuddain become flattering and inſinuating friends; for, it was for little good that they who, even now, were ſeeking to kill him, do in a flattering way call him <hi>Maſter,</hi> and do ſet this woman <hi>in the mids,</hi> or, in open judgement, before him, and do ſeek reſolution concerning her from him. 3. Such is the perverſity of fallen man, that whatever God do teſtifie of his diſpleaſure, by word or judgements, againſt groſſeſt ſinnes; Yet they are continued in and followed, yea, and committed in times when God calls them to ſolemne-exerciſes of his worſhip: for, albeit adultery be expreſſely prohibited, as a groſſe iniquity, and albeit that and the like uncleanneſſe had oftentimes drawn down very remarkable judgements, as on <hi>Sodom</hi> and the tribe of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> Yet there is <hi>a woman taken in adultery,</hi> and that in the time of their ſolemne feaſt. 4. Albeit men think to carry their ſinnes very cloſly; and albeit uncleanneſſe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, be a work of darkneſſe; Yet the Lord, when he pleaſeth can eaſily bring it out to light; for, ſhe is <hi>taken in the very act.</hi> And albeit many may eſcape this, yet the Lord can make their ſinne finde them out, and make their own conſciences bring it out many years after it is committed. 5. Albeit the Lord may juſtly bring out hidden ſinne, that the ſinner may be made a ſpectacle of his vengeance; Yet oft-times it proves a great mercy to the ſinner, when he gets not liberty to lurk in a ſinful courſe, but is brought out to light with it: As here it proved in the iſſue, this woman being diſcovered, is brought to Chriſt even by his very enemies, and (in appearance) gets good of him, which ſhe had miſſed, if ſhe had not been found out. 6. The Lord doth ſo far deteſt the ſinne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, violating the Covenant of marriage, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in women, who do corrupt a family, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an illegitimate iſſue into it; That it is his will, that ſuch, a tranſgreſſion be puniſhed with death: for, ſo do they repeat his Law given by <hi>Moſes, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned;</hi> and being a puniſhment of a moral tranſgreſſion, it ſhould ſtand in force ſo long as the tranſgreſſion is ſtill the ſame: The law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the putting of adulterers to death, is clear from <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.22. But for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of it, <hi>by ſtoning,</hi> it ſeems to be gathered from that particular Law, concerning the betrothed Virgin, and him that lay with her, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.23, 24. 7. It is the diſpoſition of wicked men, to make it their ſtudy to lay ſnares, whereby they think to entrap Gods people, and to ſeek advantages againſt them; partly, by faire language, and partly, by cunning tentations, that ſo they may make them and their way odious: for, ſo do they deale with Chriſt, they flatter him, and ask <hi>but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> but they did it <hi>tempting him, that they might have to accuſe him.</hi> And albeit they gained nothing at Chriſts hand in this; Yet his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48148:82"/>
followers have need to be cautious, and to beware of ſubtile inſinuaters: Not that it is beſt to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſubtilty with ſubtilty, but they ſhould look on honeſty as great ſafety, and divine policy, in ſuch caſes. 8. Chriſt doth eaſily diſcerne the drift of his enemies, and doth know which are tempting curious queſtions, and which are propounded out of neceſſity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>John,</hi> being taught of him, record what was their drift, <hi>This they ſaid tempting him, that they might have to accuſe him.</hi> And indeed, when any come to Chriſt with caſes, he firſt looks into the queſtioners heart, that he may know how it is affected with what he propounds, before he anſwer it.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond place, we have Chriſts dealing with them who brought the woman, and propounded the caſe. And, 1.

When his ſilence ſeemed to them to flow from ſome advantage they had of him in this matter, and therefore they importune him the more: He leaves the queſtion, and turnes to the queſtioners, bidding them ſearch their own boſomes, and ſince they needed not witneſſes, who were to caſt the firſt ſtone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.7. He bids thoſe among them, who were without ſinne, ſupply that office; and again writes upon the ground, in teſtimony of his diſlike of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. Upon this, 3. Followeth the effect of Chriſts anſwer, which is the conviction of theſe wicked men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious to themſelves what they were, and not willing to confeſſe it, nor to debate with him who could bring them out to light before the people, they take advantage of his ſtooping down, to ſlip quietly away, leaving the woman and Chriſt alone (not ſimply alone, for the multitude ſtayed and the woman <hi>in the midſt,</hi> but all the accuſers left them) And this they did, <hi>beginning at the eldeſt,</hi> who were moſt guilty, and moſt prudent to diſcerne what was in this anſwer, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. For clearing this anſwer a little, Conſider, 1. As for that phraſe, <hi>he that is without ſinne,</hi> which imports a compleat purity, we need not here curiouſly diſtinguiſh it, from that <hi>blameleſneſſe</hi> and being irreprehenſible, which is elſewhere urged, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of God requires both, and it was their great preſumption to inſult ſo over the woman, and over Chriſt as an enemy to the Law, when yet they were not only not ſinleſſe, but not free of the like groſſe crimes, if not the ſame, wherein the woman was taken. 2. Chriſts requiring they ſhould be without ſinne who execute this ſentence, doth not condemne Magiſtrates, who execute juſtice, though themſelves be ſinners; Yea, though they be vitious themſelves. For he doth not ſpeak, as a Magiſtrate, preſcribing that none ſhould be puniſhed but by innocent and blameleſſe men; nor doth he condemne the doing of juſtice and puniſhing of ſinne in it ſelfe: But as a teacher, he ſheweth what God will finde culpable in Magiſtrates; to wit, if they make little conſcience of their own ſinnes, when yet they puniſh ſinne in others 3. Albeit Chriſts diſcourſe doth not anſwer directly to their queſtion, yet it fully breaks their ſnare laid for him, and brings a ſnare upon themſelves. For it doth not ſtrike againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, ſeeing he acknowledgeth the equi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of the ſentence of ſtoning, though he was not a Judge to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, and as a Miniſter would have them look to their own conſciences. Nor doth this rough dealing contradict his doctrine of free-grace, ſeeing he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to unhumbled Phariſees, that he may fit them for his mercy, and he deales ſweetly with the woman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. But as for them, his diſcourſe doth indeed pinch them, while as they who boaſted ſo much of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Law, are found to regard it ſo little in their own practice, that their conſciences ſends them away confounded. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. As Chriſt knoweth who propound queſtions, only to tempt him, and who deſire to be taught; So he who warmely entertains the one, doth juſtly ſleight the other, as unworthy of an anſwer: for, <hi>But Jeſus ſtooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</hi> It is but curioſity to enquire what he wrote; but his end in it, was, not only to ſhew, that it is fitter Miniſters do any thing, then employ themſelves in civil affaires; but chiefly to ſhew, that their queſtion was idle, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no anſwer. 2. Chriſts enemies may get leave to think that they have ſome notable advantage of him and his followers, only that their own diſappointment may be the more ſhameful and ſad: for, before they are convinced, they think Chriſt is ſilent becauſe he knew not what to ſay, and therefore <hi>they continued ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him,</hi> as inſulting over him in their own mindes, if not alſo in their expreſſions. 3. Albeit Chriſt be tender and gracious toward humbled ſinners; Yet he will ſtrictly preſſe the Law upon all ſuch as conceit of their righteouſneſſe, and will not come to him; Therefore doth he deal ſo roughly with thoſe men, and points out what the Law required of them. 4. The perfect and ſpiritual Law of God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of men, not only that they be without publike and viſible blemiſh: but that they be without ſinne or ſpot: for ſo much doth Chriſt require of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled men, that they be <hi>without ſinne,</hi> 5. It is the will of God, that theſe who puniſh ſinne in others, ſhould be ſenſible of their own failings and that the ſenſe of their own ſinnes make them tender toward others: And it is a token of unſanctified Spirits, when men who cenſure or puniſh others, do not look
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48148:83"/>
upon their own wayes, nor do abſtain from all lewd practices themſelves, nor look upon the worſt of ſinners as their own picture, if they were left to themſelves: for, this is the ſcope of Chriſts anſwer, as is before explained. 6. In our neceſſary medling with wicked men, it is our duty to take heed we do nothing that may ſeeme to approve them in their wicked wayes: Therefore, <hi>again he ſtooped down and wrote on the ground,</hi> to teſtifie that as at firſt he liked not their diſcourſe; So yet he approved it not (however he had anſwered it) nor would keep up conference with them. 7. As without Chriſts pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the moſt ſpiritual doctrine will do no good to the beſt of men; ſo when he pleaſeth, he can put an edge upon a very ſhort ſentence, to make it waken the moſt benummed conſcience, and cauſe it imprint inward challenges upon the heart, and outward ſhame upon the foreheads of men: for, ſo doth it here appear, they are <hi>convicted by their own conſcience,</hi> and glad of an opportunity to ſteal away. 8. A wakened conſcience will get other things to think upon, then to be taken up with idle cavils about Religion, or deſcanting upon the faults of others onely, for, they quit both their tempting of Chriſt, and accuſing of the woman, and ſteal away. 9. A wakened conſcience will tell a man, that the longer he liveth, his guilt is ſtill encreaſing, and he hath daily the more cauſe to be aſhamed of himſelf for it, for, ſo much is imported that <hi>they went out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the eldeſt, even to the laſt.</hi> 10. Every conviction of conſcience is not ſaving, nor is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in a ſtate of grace, whoſe conſcience findes the edge of the word, to make him aſhamed of ſin; for, theſe men are <hi>convicted;</hi> and <hi>went out,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed, who yet are but in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 11. It is a ſure evidence of an unſound wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of conſcience, when mens convictions make them flee from Chriſt, and ſhun either his further convictions or comforts; Whereas it is good not to go away from him, when ſin is diſcovered, and the truly humbled ſinner is kept with him till he finde favour: for, ſo appears in them, being <hi>convicted,</hi> they <hi>went out</hi> from Chriſt, and that <hi>one by one,</hi> without noiſe, when he was now ſtooping down, that ſo he might not have occaſion to ſay any more to them: whereas the poor woman, though let go, <hi>ſtands</hi> ſtill <hi>in the midſt,</hi> in the place where ſhe was ſifted as a guilty perſon, till ſhe hear what Chriſt will ſay to her. 12. All the plots of wicked men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, will at laſt tend to their own viſible and open ſhame: for, this was the iſſue of their enterpriſe. They came in with a reſolution to have entrapped Chriſt, and they are ſent out with much ſhame and confuſion on their own faces.</p>

                  <p>In the third place, We have Chriſts dealing with the woman herſelf; who being left by her accuſers, and not condemned by them, he doth alſo diſmiſſe her with a gentle warning, to watch over her wayes in time to come. In doing whereof, he doth not make void the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor ſay that none ought to condemne her to death, but he declines to act the part of a civil Magiſtrate in paſſing ſentence upon her, and doth act the part of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, in abſolving an humbled ſinner. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> 1. As they who run away from Chriſt, when they are convinced, do but go on in their ſinne, and carry their ſhame with them; So they who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon Chriſt, and betake themſelves to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of condemned ſinners, will at laſt get a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer; as this womans experience doth teach, who (when her accuſers went out) did ſtay ſtill, to her own great advantage. 2. It is neceſſary, that ſuch as are waiting on Chriſt for grace, be ſerious obſervers of his dealing, that from thence they may learn to know what a one he is: for, his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>when he lift up himſelf, Where are thoſe thine accuſers? hath no man condemned thee?</hi> did not ſlow from any ignorance in him, but ſerve to excite her to conſider the power of his word, and what effects it had produced, and to ſhew that his doings are not eaſily marked, even when they are acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. 3. Such as are truly humbled with the ſence of their ſins, will get little pleaſure to meddle, ſave with theſe things which nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves: for, albeit Chriſt propounded two queſtions, yet ſhe anſwers onely to what concerns herſelf, and that <hi>no man had condemned her,</hi> not meddling with what concerned them. 4. Such as Chriſt hath a minde to do good unto, are not to expect that ſo much will be intimate unto them at firſt, but they muſt be content to be exerciſed with attendance, and ſpeaking to Chriſt, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat deliverance come; for, ſo much appears in his dealing with this woman, He ſpeaks ſo in her cauſe to the Phariſees, as encourageth her to ſtay ſtill, till ſhe ſee what further he will ſay: Then, he leads her up to ſpeak to him, and gives her a ground of an argument, that ſince no man had condemned her, therefore he, the Saviour of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, would deal gently with her: and at laſt, he brings out his ſweet ſentence, 5. The charge and office of the Miniſtry is inconſiſtent, in Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, with the exerciſe of the office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, in one and the ſame perſon; and it is ſo weighty a calling, that it is enough to take up the whole man: Therefore, doth Chriſt, the great Meſſenger of the Covenant and Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, refuſe to take on that calling, <hi>Neither do I condemne thee.</hi> So alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 12.13, 14. 6. It is the allowance of Chriſt, that humble and caſt down ſinners be gently dealt with by his Miniſters; and his rich grace will abſolve ſuch as do condemne themſelves before him: for, by this ſentence, he not onely declines to exerciſe the office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, but doth abſolve her, whom he knew to be humbled, in the Court of conſcience. 7. It ought to be no impediment to humble ſinners to expect abſolution from Chriſt, that their ſins are ſuch as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48148:83"/>
by the Law of God and man deſerves bodily death, or that they are to die a violent death for them: for, though this ſin deſerved ſtoning by the Law of God; yet that doth not hinder Chriſt to give her a pardon. 8. Grace is ſo abſolute and free, that it can make a very ſudden change in ſinners; it can take them, as it were, in the very height of their impiety, and convert and make pardoned Saints of them; for, ſo it appears in this woman, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in the very act of adultery, goeth not away from Chriſt till ſhe be abſolved. 9. Such as have taſted of Chriſts grace in pardoning their ſin, will retain ſo much ſenſe of their own corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and of their obligation to Chriſt for his mercy, that it will put them to a wary and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking for time to come: for, ſo much is imported in the direction ſubjoyned to her abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Neither do I condemn thee; go, and ſin no more.</hi> See <hi>chap.</hi> 5.14. 10. Albeit humble and pardoned ſinners ſhould have an eye eſpecially, upon the ſins they have been formerly addicted unto, and upon groſſe and ſcandalous evils, that they break not out into them; Yet they ſhould alſo be ſenſible of their proneneſſe to all ſinne, as having the ſeed of all ſin within them, and ſhould have an univerſal hatred againſt all ſin, and be watchful over themſelves, that they fall not into any ſin: Therefore is the direction general, <hi>Sin no more,</hi> that ſhe ſhould not onely be jealous of her own inclination to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer debordings, or oppoſe and ſtrive againſt ſome ſins, while ſhe delighted in other ſins, but that ſhe ſhould watch againſt all kind of ſin.</p>

As for the time wherein this was done, we need not determine that it was on another day then that wherein he abſolved the adultereſſe, which ſome gather from this that the Phariſees were then gone out, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. and are now come in again, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. for it may be conceived, that theſe who now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him, were ſome others then they who had brought in the woman, who remained among the multitude, to watch for all advantages; or, it needs not be thought ſtrange, that even they ſhould have ſo much impudence, as ſhortly to return back, to oppoſe his Miniſtry ſo much as they could.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, in this <hi>verſe</hi> we have Chriſt returning to his office of preaching, after that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption made by the Scribes and Phariſees, and making a rich offer of himſelf, which occaſions all the ſubſequent debates and diſcourſes. And in it, taking occaſion (as would appear) of the Sunnes riſing and bright ſhining in the morning, he holds out himſelf as the true Sun of righteouſneſſe and light of the world; offering to all theſe who follow him, that they ſhall not onely have preſent light to order and ſweeten their walking, but that this light ſhall bring life with it, and lead to eternal life. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever interruptions wicked men lay in Chriſts way, yet he will not be hindered from doing and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to ſinners: for, notwithſtanding they hindered him in preaching, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3. Yet now he returns to it again, <hi>Then ſpake Jeſus again unto them.</hi> 2. There is no better way to conciliate love to Chriſt, then to ſtudy to know him well, in his natures, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, riches, and free offers to ſinners: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he commend himſelf here that they may follow him, <hi>I am the light of the world, &amp;c</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3, 4. 3. The whole world lies in darkneſſe of it ſelf, being ignorant of miſery, and of the remedy thereof, following the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and liable to affliction, wrath, and want of comfort, and to be caſt into outer darkneſſe, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: for, ſo is imported in this Doctrine, that without Chriſt, mankinde are as the world is without the Sunne, and the uſe of theſe lights which are enlightened thereby. 4. The remedy of this ſad condition is onely to be had in Chriſt, and he is able to cure all this darkneſſe, by enlightening the minde, and cauſing men to know themſelves, by diſcovering and diſpelling the works of darkneſſe, removing of wrath and miſery, giving clear and wholſome directions in duty, and chearing up and warming the hearts of his own with his comforts: for, ſaith he, <hi>I am the light of the world.</hi> See <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.4, 5, 9. The Father is indeed a light to which no man can approach, and before whom Angels do cover their faces; but this light being revealed in the Sonne, is brought near, and made comfortable unto men. And his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Meſſengers are called <hi>lights,</hi> becauſe they inſtrumentally conveigh this light which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth originally from him. 5. Chriſt's grace and light is not confined to one place or ſort of perſons, but is patent to the world, and to men of all ranks and conditions in it; Therefore is he called <hi>the light of the world.</hi> 6. They who would participate of the riches that are in Chriſt, ought to take him for their guide, and follow him, neither preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go before and preſcribe unto him, nor yet loitering and lying by when he, in his example and directions, is going before; for, the advantage of this offer is, to <hi>him that followeth me,</hi> ſaith he. 7. As it is the duty of men who would partake of Chriſts riches, to follow him; So they who follow him indeed, will employ all the comfort they finde in him, to enable and encourage them to duty, and will account it ſufficient, if they be enabled to walk after him, whatever their lot be otherwiſe. Therefore is the promiſe held out containing what they may expect <hi>in walking.</hi> 8. They who follow Chriſt, may expect that in his light they ſhall ſee light; They will not be left in darkneſſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor under the power of the wayes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or under the danger of outer darkneſſe: And albeit ſometime they may be left under a dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wanting comfort, and feeling wrath, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

Yet neither is that their allowance, nor ſhall they conſtantly walk ſo, or be left altogether under ſuch a condition, but, in due time, ſhall have light ariſing in darkneſſe: for, ſo is the promiſe, <hi>he ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have light.</hi> 9. The light that comes from Chriſt will have quickening life accompanying it, and doth in the iſſue tend to eternal life, whereas the falſe light of the wicked, ends in ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11.

                     <hi>In the next place, we have Chriſts firſt conference and debate with the Phariſees, who contradict his teſtimony, as worthy to be ſuſpected,</hi> verſe 13. <hi>To which Chriſt replies, aſſerting the truth and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own teſtimony,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>chalenging them for raſh judgement of him, when yet he was not judging them,</hi> verſe 15. <hi>though if he did it his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were to be regarded, having not onely himſelfe but his Father to bear witneſſe to him, which were a ſufficient number of witneſſes by the Law,</hi> verſe 16, 17, 18. <hi>but they were ignorant of the Father, as they were of him,</hi> verſe 19. <hi>To which is ſubjoyned, that however he ſpake thus freely, and they had a great minde to take him, and had him among their hands, yet they were reſtrained,</hi> verſe 20.</p>
                  <p>In theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> We have their exception againſt his teſtimony, as obnoxious to be ſuſpected, ſeeing he ſpeaks ſo much in his own cauſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. And Chriſt, albeit, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.31. he did, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition, paſſe this, that he might bring in the many witneſſes that pleaded for him; Yet here he doth aſſert that his teſtimony concerning himſelf is true: Which he confirmes from this reaſon; That he came from God, and was to return to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and being certain of this, he might aſſert it, whereas they being ignorant hereof, did carp at him. The force of this reaſon conſiſts in theſe; partly, That he being God, who came from the Father in reſpect of his manifeſtation in the fleſh, and was to return to him in regard of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his glory in the humane nature exalted, he was a witneſſe above all exception: partly, That being the great Angel of the Covenant, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour from the Father, to whom he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an account, he might lawfully publiſh his own Inſtructions and Commiſſion which were revealed onely to himſelf, and ought to be credited: And partly, That he perfectly knowing this, might bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie and ſtand to it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are endleſſe and reſtleſſe in their oppoſitions unto the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel: for, after their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer interruption, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. He no ſooner begins to preach again, but they do again cavil. 2. Chriſts rich offers will not prevail with malitious enemies, to make them quit their oppoſition and ſubmit: for, when he is not threatning, but graciouſly inviting ſinners to partake of his fulneſſe, they yet cavil. 3. Whatever juſt cauſe there be to ſuſpect their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, who are but ſinful and meere men, when they commend themſelves; Yet this derogates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the glory of Chriſts being true in his teſtimonies concerning himſelf: for, albeit they think they have great advantage of Chriſt from this common principle, <hi>Thou beareſt record of thy ſelf, thy record is not true,</hi> yet it hath no weight at all here. It is true indeed that the corrupt nature of man, (which is prone too ſeek it ſelf, and hunt after vain-glory, which yet is as eaſily loſt as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and cannot bear our weight in a day of diſtreſſe) may render ſuch a teſtimony uncertain, but not neceſſarily prove it untrue, even in men; For honeſt men may lawfully commend themſelves in ſome caſes, and yet not bear falſe-witneſſe, nor yet be guilty of ſelf-ſeeking. But it doth not at all hold true in Chriſt who is ſeparate from ſinners, and not to be bound by the rules preſcribed to men in ſuch caſes. 4. Enemies their oppoſing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting of Chriſt, will not make void his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; but he can make their oppoſition occaſion much benefit to his people: for, albeit they thought by cavils to hinder his preaching, yet his very defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and replies did bring forth moſt precious truths of the Goſpel, for the edification of his hearers then, and of his people to the end of the world. 5 What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be Chriſts gracious condeſcendence, for the conviction of ſinners, and confirmation of his own; Yet he will not allow that any ſhould deny him the glory of any of his prerogatives, and particularly of his truth: Therefore albeit he formerly condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, <hi>Chap</hi> 5. 31. to wave his teſtimony of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that ſo friends and foes might ſee how many witneſſes he had for him; Yet here when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, he will not paſſe from it, <hi>Though I bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true.</hi> 6. Chriſt being true God that cannot lie, and who onely can reveal himſelf and his will; and coming out of the boſome of the Father as Ambaſſadour into the world; he is an authentick witneſſe, above all exception, in what he reveals; and his naked teſtimony and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be credited, without ſeeking further proof or arguments: Therefore doth he confirme the truth of his record from the conſideration of <hi>whence he came.</hi> 7. As Chriſt and his followers came into the world for awhile, to do the ſervice for which they are appointed, and then to go to God; ſo the exaltation of Chriſt doth put his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original and authority; and conſequently, the truth of his teſtimony, out of all queſtion; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he ſubjoyne <hi>whither he goeth,</hi> not onely as the comfortable iſſue of his toile, which he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48148:84"/>
looked to, but as a clear proof that he came from God, and conſequently, that his record is true. 8. Such as are employed in Commiſſion from God to carry his minde, and do vouch on that they have an account to make to God who ſent them, will finde a neceſſity to cleave to their Commiſſion, and to publiſh nothing but truth: So much alſo may be learned from Chriſts argument, who conſidering <hi>whence he came, and whither he goeth,</hi> doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bear a true record. 9. Chriſts knowledge of his own excellencie and authority, is ſufficient to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the truth of his doctrine, whoever elſe be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it; for, he proves it true on this, <hi>I know whence I came, &amp;c.</hi> albeit, ſaith he, <hi>ye cannot tell, &amp;c.</hi> 10. They who would cleave to controverted and oppoſed truth, ſhould not have it by gueſſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſhould certainly know and be perſwaded of it, and then ſpeak for it: So much alſo may be learned from Chriſts confirming the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thus, that not onely he was indeed from God, and his doctrine the truth, but <hi>I know whence I came, &amp;c.</hi> 11. It is mens ignorance (either ſimple or affected) of Chriſts perſon and Commiſſion, that makes them ſo little regard, or lay ſo little weight on his doctrine and teſtimony; Therefore, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his knowledge, he ſubjoynes, <hi>but ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whence I come, or whither I go,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do carp at my teſtimony and doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Before Chriſt produce any farther proof of the truth of his record, he doth here challenge them for their cenſure of him. And as in the former <hi>verſe</hi> he points out a difference betwixt himſelf and them in the point of knowing whence he came and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth; So here he points out another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and a defect in them flowing from this miſtake: To wit, that as they were ignorant of him, ſo they judged carnally of him, and according to outward appearance, being led by their carnal principles. Whereas he, on the contrary, judged no man; Which is not to be underſtood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their manner of judging, that he judged no man after the fleſh; for (though that be true, yet) then what is ſubjoyned, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that he might judge after the fleſh. Nor is it to be underſtood, that he judged no man in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way, but onely, in an eccleſiaſtical way, was pointing out their faults; for neither in that reſpect will the oppoſition betwixt him and them ſtand, ſeeing they were not now judging him in any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical way, but onely cenſuring his doctrine and perſon: Nor yet is it Chriſts meaning in this place, to ſhew that he deveſts himſelf of that ſovereigne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and government that he hath over men, and all creatures, joyntly with the Father, of which <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 22. for that he never quits; but his ſcope, is, to ſhew that he forbare the exerciſe of it, in ſome reſpects, for a time. And particularly, 1. That his chief errand in this his firſt coming, was not to judge men, but to purchaſe and offer ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to loſt ſinners, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 17. and if any were condemned, it was but an accidental event flowing from mens own corruptions. 2. More eſpecially, now when they were judging him, he was not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but teaching and making rich offers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their carriage was more blame-worthy. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. Albeit malicious carpers, or other enemies, can do nothing to Chriſts prejudice, yet will he not paſſe the wrong intended by them in their endeavours, without a rebuke: Therefore, albeit he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their cavils could not make void his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, yet he will challenge them for their attempt. 2. Raſh judging and cenſuring of Chriſt, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and way, is the ordinary fault of his enemies, and an injury which he will not endure at their hands; for, this is their particular attempt which he reproves, that they fell a <hi>judging.</hi> 3. Men by nature are ſo blinde and fleſhly, that their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt and his matters is to be ſuſpected, and ſuch as juſtly deſerves a reproof from him; for, this was, in part, their fault, <hi>ye judge after the fleſh,</hi> or according to the dictates of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon and hearts, which cannot perceive the things that are of God. 4. To judge of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to viſible and outward appearances of his perſon or Kingdome, or according to our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate thoughts; is but a corrupt judgement, and ſuch as doth provoke him to anger; for this farther, and in particular, was their fault, in <hi>judging after the fleſh,</hi> when their prejudices and blinded judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments let them ſee no more of Chriſt then his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. 5. It is the will of God, that his ſervants be found in meekneſſe about their duty, when they are encountred with hard meaſure and unjuſt uſage from their enemies; for, ſo doth Chriſts example teach, who when they judged him, was <hi>judging no man,</hi> neither in the general exerciſe of his calling, nor at this Sermon in particular. 6. It ſpeaks Chriſts gracious condeſcendence unto loſt man, that he firſt aſſayes him with the ſweet offer of ſalvation in the Goſpel, to ſee how that will work, before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſentence of condemnation; for, ſaith he, <hi>I judge no man,</hi> in this my ſtate of humiliation, and at this time in particular. And albeit he ſpake ſometimes ſharply unto them, yet it tended but to drive them to his mercie. 7. Chriſts milde manner of dealing, even to his enemies, doth adde to their dittey, and aggravate their condemnation, who do not onely ſleight, but oppoſe him; Therefore doth Chriſt mention this, to ſhew how great their guilt was, in malicious carping at him; <hi>ye judge after the fleſh, I judge no man.</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to offer ſalvation unto loſt ſinners, yet if he pleaſed, he might in place thereof, judge and condemne them, and yet do no wrong; for, he ſpeaks here of his judging, as a thing he might well do, if he pleaſed. 2. Chriſt cannot erre in judging of men; but as all his teſtimonies are true, ſo alſo he is true in judging, how croſſe ſoever it ſeem to us; for, <hi>yet if I judge, my judgement is true.</hi> 3. As all theſe who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in his ſervice are never left alone by him in their difficulties; So in particular, Chriſt and the Father are undivided in the work of judging of men, as in all other works; and the Father is ſtill with him as being of the ſame eſſence, and as with his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour and ſervant, acting according to his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me,</hi> where he proves the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conjunction with him, from his being his <hi>Father,</hi> by eternal generation, and from his <hi>ſending</hi> of him. 4 Chriſts union with the Father, in judging, is an infallible proofe that he cannot erre in that work. It being impoſſible that he who is God, one with the Father, and who in all things walks according to his Fathers inſtructions, ſhould erre in any of his teſtimonies or records: Therefore is it given as a reaſon why his <hi>judgement is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Laws given by God do not ſerve for rules to direct or binde him, who is ſupreme and above all Law; but to be a rule and direction to theſe to whom they are given; Therefore it is called <hi>your law,</hi> not that they were the penmen or preſcribers of it, nor yet only becauſe they gloried of it, albeit they did little regard it in practice, but becauſe it was given for their uſe and direction. 2. It is the will of God, that, as men ſhould not be raſh in private judging, ſo, in publike contraverſies, they ſhould not proceed to judgement upon every report or ſingle teſtimony, but, at leaſt, the matter muſt be proven by two witneſſes; for, ſaith he, <hi>It is written in your Law, that the teſtimony of two men is true.</hi> Not that neceſſarily every thing that is deponed by two witneſſes is true, for falſe witneſſes may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to aſſert an untruth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.60. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.11, 13. But the meaning of the Law is, that at leaſt, there ſhall be no fewer teſtimonies to prove any thing. And as great care ſhould be had in examining witneſſes, to finde out if there be any falſhood, (wherein, even in perſecuting of Chriſt, the Phariſees were exact, <hi>Marke</hi> 14.55, 56.) and for more ſecurity, the Jewes put the witneſſes to confirme their teſtimony, by being firſt in executing the ſentence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.6, 7. So where two witneſſes concurre in one teſtimony, the matter is to be accounted legally true and proven, albeit the witneſſes ſhould lie. 3. Albeit Chriſt, as God, be above Law, yet his wayes are ſo juſt, that the Law can have no juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt him; Therefore doth he confirme his aſſertion from their own Law. For, if the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of two men (who are fallible and may deceive) doth ſuffice to prove a matter to be true; how much more is he to be credited, who is witneſſed unto by the Father, and by himſelfe as God witneſſing of himſelfe, as man and Mediatour; ſeeing theſe witneſſes are truth it ſelfe, who cannot lie, nor be byaſſed? 4. The truth of Chriſts offers unto loſt ſinners is ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by unqueſtionable witneſſes, that none can call them in queſtion, without egregious wrong done to God; So much alſo may be gathered from this double witneſſe, of <hi>himſelfe, and the Father that ſent him.</hi> 5. The Father and the Sonne, albeit one and undivided in eſſence and operation; yet are diſtinct perſons, and did diſtinctly bear witneſſe in this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie concerning the man Chriſt, and his offers as Mediatour; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am one that bear witneſſe of my ſelfe, and the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſſe of me.</hi>

queſtion, but declares they were both ignorant of the Father and him, and ignorant of the Father, becauſe they knew not him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Let truth be never ſo clearly held forth, yet (without the power of grace) enemies will not be gained thereby, but they will ſtill jangle, and ſet their wit and parts on work to finde out new cavils; for ſo do they here, all the fruit of Chriſts doctrine on them, is a new taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtion, <hi>where is thy Father?</hi> 2. Where there is greateſt conceit of parts and abilities, there is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily greateſt real ignorance, eſpecially of ſaving truths in a ſaving manner; for, theſe great <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> who think themſelves able enough, to hold up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with Chriſt, yet this ſentence from him, <hi>ye neither know me, nor my Father.</hi> 3. Albeit the Father and the Sonne be two diſtinct perſons; Yet they are undivided in eſſence, ſo that the one cannot be known without the other; And particularly, albeit devils may beleeve there is a deitie and tremble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. and albeit Jewes and others may have ſome notions of him as Creatour of the world; Yet there is no ſaving knowledge of God but in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>ye neither know me, nor my Father,</hi> and particularly, he aſſerts their ignorance of the Father, becauſe <hi>they knew not him.</hi> 4. The divine nature did ſo evidently ſhine in the Sonne, that whoſoever knew what a deitie was, might have ſeen it in him; and whoſoever took up his deitie, were thereby forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with led to know the deitie of the Father; for, ſaith he, <hi>if ye had known me, ye ſhould have known the Father alſo.</hi> And herein Gods gracious condeſcendence is to be ſeen, who ſince his divine nature could not be comprehended nor taken up by us, was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal and manifeſt himſelfe in his own Sonne (the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of his perſon) cloathed with our; fleſh, and to hold out this mirrour unto us in that word which is neare unto us, and which doth prevent our anxious thoughts about aſcending up to heaven, or deſcending down unto the deep, <hi>Romans</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</p>

As for this place, <hi>the Treaſury,</hi> the Jewes had a cheſt in <hi>Joaſh</hi> his time, wherein they received the peoples collections as they entred into the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it ſeems they continued this practice afterward, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.41. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.1. But this was a room or chamber belonging to the Temple, wherein theſe treaſures and other things belonging to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Temple, were kept; of which ſee, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.5, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.1. and 31.11, 12. <hi>Neb.</hi> 13.5.—9. and 10.37, 38. <hi>Ez.</hi> 8.29. And as this was their cuſtome then, ſo the Lord doth yet require that ſomewhat be laid up for Religious uſes, providing it be lawfully acquired, and rightly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. The many hazards wherein Chriſt and his ſervants may be, and the many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that enemies ſeem to have over them, ſhould not cool their courage in doing dutie; for, <hi>theſe words,</hi> which were ſo ſharp, <hi>ſpake Jeſus</hi> even <hi>in the treaſury, as he taught in the Temple.</hi> 2. As enemies are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in their rage and attempts, againſt Chriſt and his people; So the providence of God is as vigilant to preſerve them, ſo long as he ſeeth fit; for, as before, ſo over again, <hi>no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</hi> The providence of God was as effectual for his preſervation at one time, as at another. 3. This frequent repetition of his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe his hour was not yet come, ſerveth not only as an encouragement to his people, in being faithful in their duty and truſt, ſeeing they are guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him who can preſerve ſo often. But further ſerves to teach 1. Many deliverances ſhould never make us put thoughts of ſuffering, in Gods time, out of our minde; for Chriſts preſervation ſo frequently is ſtill ſeaſoned with this, <hi>his hour was coming,</hi> though <hi>not yet.</hi> 2. Former preſervation ſpeaks ſo much of Gods power and favour, as may make his people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to endure ſuffering, when his will is to expoſe them to it; for, ſuch uſe doth Chriſt make of this his frequent preſervation, when they take him, which is the meaning in part of <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.53. 3. Chriſt alſo makes uſe of it in that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.55. to teſtifie, that as his bold and open carriage, and his preſervation in it, did bear witneſſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and of Gods favour toward him; ſo their clandeſtine courſe did teſtifie what confuſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they had in it. And indeed however enemies may carry themſelves high, when they are perſecuting; Yet their conſciences within are a ſufficient witneſſe and torture to them, if they would ſuffer them to ſpeak.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48148:86"/>
them to an account,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>and that (however they underſtood not this at preſent,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>yet) after his ſuffering, they ſhould be convinced that he is the Meſſiah, obedient unto, and approven of his Father,</hi> verſe 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have the ſumme of this Sermon; wherein, conſidering that they deſpiſed his rich offer, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and not only ſo, but they intended violence againſt him: Therefore, he threatens them with the removal of himſelfe, and that however they ſeek him, yet they ſhall periſh in their ſinnes, and have no acceſſe to him. Of this ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 34. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. The greateſt of oppoſition will not drive Chriſt away, where he hath a minde to ſtay, or till he pleaſe; for, he would not be put away by their violence, but <hi>I go,</hi> ſaith he. 2. The wicked may at laſt get their will of Chriſt, ſo far as to be rid of him, but for a plague to them; for to them who would have taken him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he ſaith, <hi>I go my way.</hi> 3. Where Chriſts gracious offers are rejected, and himſelfe perſecuted, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that he will remove; for, to ſuch he ſaith, <hi>again,</hi> as his next meſſage, after the former, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>I go my way.</hi> 4. As Chriſts removal is the ſaddeſt of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo it is a judgement, the evil whereof is not eaſily laid to heart; Therefore muſt it be ſo oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate upon them, as their ſaddeſt ſtroak. 5. Chriſts removal from a people draws on ſuch miſeries, as may make great deſpiſers miſſe and need him, and make them glad to ſeek him, if ſo be they could finde him; for, <hi>I go my way and ye ſhall ſeek me.</hi> 6. Since reprobate men do ſometime ſeek Chriſt whom they deſpiſed, not becauſe they love him any better, nor becauſe they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give him any employment about their ſinne; but only to be rid of trouble by him; Therefore ſuch ſeekers do die impenitents for all their pains, and go to their graves before they be rid of their ſinnes, and with their bones full of them; for, to ſuch he ſaith, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall die in your ſinne,</hi> that is, die impenitent, and pine away under the puniſhment of iniquity, till they die, and that becauſe they would not die to ſinne. 7. Such as do reject Chriſt here, and die impenitent and unreconciled with him, ſhall finde his removal from them will end in eternal ſeparation; Therefore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>whither I go ye cannot come.</hi>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have their taunting reply to this ſad threatning.

None are more ready to deſpiſe threatnings, then they who moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and lie neareſt the danger of them; for, ſo appears in the anſwer given by theſe hearers, 2. Such as do once breed themſelves to a deſpiſing of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, will grow ſtill the longer the more hardened and inſolent, till the execution of vengeance diſcover their folly; for, now they are grown worſe then in their former reply, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 35.

Loftie pride, in mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Word, and taunting the meſſengers thereof, will not go away without exemplare puniſhment, and ſuch ſcoffers may meet with that plague in reality, which they in reproach caſt upon the ſervants of God; for, ſo befell theſe ſcoffers; They tauntingly ſuppoſe Chriſt will kill himſelfe, but within few yeares, in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> many of them were redacted to ſuch deſpair in their extremities, that they did indeed cut off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 5. It is a great deluſion among men, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſucceſſe of threatnings, and making them inſolent and bitter when they are threatned, that they entertain a great conceit of their own worth, and will not be perſwaded but it will be as well with them as any; for, this was the cauſe of all this peoples miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; They conceived Chriſt could go to no good place from whence they would be ſecluded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do ſo taunt him.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt in his anſwer doth not meddle with their perverſe humours, but goeth on to confirme what he had ſaid. And, 1. He pointeth out the reaſon and ground of his ſad ſentence, to wit, their original diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is corrupt and earthly, and contrary to his, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and this alſo is a cauſe of their ignorant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of their own danger. 2. From this he inferreth, that he had juſtly ſaid they ſhould die in their ſinnes, ſeeing they would not by faith embrace him, who only could apply a remedy to their evils, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough that wicked men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their evil deeds, unleſſe they alſo ſtudy their original condition, and know that their evil practices do not flow only from a preſent tentation, or from evil breeding and education, but are the fruits of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption; Therefore doth Chriſt point out this to theſe Jewes. 2. Albeit man before the fall, was raiſed up to enjoy a ſpiritual life and communion with God, yet by the fall, he is caſt down, and hath his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48148:86"/>
from beneath and favours only of the world and of things therein: for, ſo much doth he intimate to theſe Jewes, <hi>Ye are from beneath, ye are of this world,</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſt did take on our nature, yet he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free of the ſinne and corruption thereof, being divine in his original and way of conception, and in his condition, holy and ſeparate from ſinners; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>I am from above, I am not of this world.</hi> Where he doth not deny the truth of his humane nature, but diſclaims all communion with ſinne and the corruption of fleſh and blood. And albeit it be ſaid of his Saints alſo that they are not of this world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. and 17.16. Yet it is true of Chriſt in a ſingular manner, for he is abſolutely unſpotted by nature, they are ſo only by regeneration, and in part, and comparatively in reſpect of others. 4. As the ſtudy of Chriſts divine original and condition, is a glaſſe wherein men may ſtudy the vileneſſe of their own condition; ſo it is a ſad evidence of ſeparation from Chriſts company, ſo long as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Men continuing in their corrupt original, without renovation from heaven, cannot expect life eternal, but will periſh in their ſinnes; for, he draws this from the former diſcourſe, by way of concluſion, <hi>I ſaid therefore unto you, that ye ſhall die in your ſinnes.</hi> 6. Albeit death be the deſert of all ſinne, and God do daily threaten ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with it; Yet all this admits of the exception of faith in Chriſt: And as this only (and nothing elſe) can come betwixt the ſinner and deſerved wrath; ſo even the groſſeſt of ſinners ſhall not periſh, if they turne and fly to Chriſt: And when ſinners do not this, their unbeliefe renders their caſe deſperate and incurable. Therefore is this threatning propounded with this exception, even to theſe malicious Jewes, <hi>If ye beleeve not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſinnes.</hi> 7. It is not ſufficient for preventing the due deſert of ſinne, that men do pretend to faith in the Meſſiah, unleſſe they do acknowledge and embrace him as he reveals and offers himſelfe; for, this Chriſt requires, as abſolutely neceſſary, that <hi>ye beleeve that I am he,</hi> where he mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As it is the lot of Chriſt and his ſervants, to have their doctrine, and threatnings in the name of the Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with reproach; ſo alſo will their perſons be miſtaken and ſet at naught; for, ſuch was Chriſts lot, they ſcofte at his doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and now they do in contempt enquire, <hi>who art thou?</hi> their blinde eyes not diſcerning his glory through the vail of his humiliation.

                  <p>This ſad doctrine taking no effect, by reaſon of their ignorance, who underſtood not that he ſpake of the Father when he mentioned him that ſent him; Chriſt doth further certifie them, that though now they were ignorant, yet after they had with wicked hands crucified him, then they ſhould be made to know that he is the Meſſiah, that he doth all things according to the Fathers will, and that the Father is alwayes with him, as being his obedient Sonne. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Were doctrine never ſo clear, yet Satan will keep men from underſtanding it, either by their ignorance or malice; for, though he had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before ſpoken of <hi>him that ſent him, yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not that he ſpake to them of the Father.</hi> Wherein there was not ſo much ſimple ignorance, as malice and prejudice which tranſported them. 2. The ignorance of wicked and malicious men will be removed in due time, little to their advantage; Therefore, Chriſt threatens that they who <hi>underſtood not, ſhall know.</hi> 3, Such as do wickedly oppoſe Chriſt and his truth, will readily run the length of bloody perſecution, before they ceaſe; for, ſo doth Chriſt forewarne them, that they will <hi>lift up the Sonne of man,</hi> by putting him to ſuffer on the croſſe. He calls himſelfe here <hi>the Sonne of man,</hi> to ſhew that he ſuffered only in that nature, and to point out his condeſcendence, that he became man, that he might ſuffer. 4. Chriſt did ſo love his people, that he willingly gave himſelfe to redeeme them, and would do nothing that might hinder his being put to that curſed death, which might redeem them from the curſe; Therefore, albeit he warne them of it, yet he will not hinder it to take effect, nor ſo much as ſpeak a word to ſtop it. 5. Wicked men are never further from their purpoſe, then when they think they are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to it, and as this is true in their own proſperity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.6, 7. So alſo in their violent perſecution of Chriſt and his followers; Therefore doth Chriſt ſignifie, that by getting this advantage of him, to put him to death, they ſhould gain nothing, but loſe much. See <hi>Mich.</hi> 4, 11, 12, 13. 6. The ſuffering of Chriſt and his followers, whatever enemies may account of it, or whatever it ſeeme to be to fleſh and blood; Yet it is their real honour and exaltation; Therefore doth he call their crucifying of him, <hi>a lifting up of the Sonne of man,</hi> not only becauſe he was indeed lifted up upon the croſſe, but becauſe it was an exaltation of him. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 32. It is an honour in Saints, to be employed to ſuffer, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. it is accompanied with much of the Spirit of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. and is a ſtep, and the way to glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. and therefore gets this name. 7. It is one peculiar advantage of ſuffering, that Chriſt and his followers true dignity, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, is never more clearly and convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, then in the time of it, and after it; Therefore it is ſubjoyned, as a particular proofe that it ſhould be an exalting of him, that, <hi>then ſhalle ye know that I am he,</hi> or, the true Meſſiah, obedient unto, and approven of God, as after followeth. And ſo we finde accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that in his ſufferings, <hi>Pilate</hi> and his wife give him a teſtimony; the Centurion ſeeth his glory, <hi>Matth,</hi> 27.54. The darkning of the Sunne, the renting of the rocks and the vail of the Temple, the opening of graves, &amp;c. did bear witneſſe who he was. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſad plagues that came on them, for rejecting of him, declared that he was the Sonne of God. 8. It is a ſad judgement upon malicious wicked men, that they are permitted to run the utmoſt length of their violence, and then (and not till then) their conſciences and Gods judgements are let looſe upon them, to let them ſee and feel what a woful courſe they have been upon; for, ſo much alſo is imported here, that <hi>when ye have lift up the Sonne of man, then ſhall ye know that I am he, &amp;c.</hi> 9. Chriſt in his works and doctrine, as he was taught them from the Father, as man, ſo they are altogether agreeable to the Fathers will; for, this is a truth whereof he will have very enemies convinced, <hi>I do nothing of my ſelfe, but as the Father hath taught me, I ſpeak theſe things:</hi> So that ſinners are to come to, and ſeek the Father in him, and ought to look on all he doth and ſaith, as agreeable to the Fathers will. 10. As the Father is unſeparable from his Sonne Chriſt, in reſpect of the unity of the divine eſſence; ſo he is alwayes with him as Mediatour, being in him, as his Ambaſſadour, reconciling the world to himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and with him, to ſupport and uphold him, as his ſervant doing his work, according to the Covenant of redemption, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>He that ſent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone,</hi> though all the world ſhould forſake
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48148:87"/>
me. Wherein we may ſee how well-pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is with the redemption of loſt ſinners, that he was ſtill upholding the Sonne in it, and how richly they are made up who have him with them, be againſt them who will, as Chriſt here reckons. 11. Whoſoever would have the comfort of Gods preſence and company in all conditions, they ought to ſet themſelves to pleaſe God, and obſerve his will in all things; for, ſo did Chriſt finde it, <hi>for I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> 12. As Chriſt the Sonne did learn obedience, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the will of the Father; So his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was full and compleat, and in all things he did, the Father was well pleaſed; for, ſaith he, <hi>I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, <hi>John</hi> records that this his doctrine had ſucceſſe among many; And albeit it was but weak beginnings they had, (as appears by Chriſts doctrine to them) yet he exhorts them to perſeverance, and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courages them in that ſtudy, by promiſing. 1. That ſo they ſhall prove themſelves to be among the number of his real diſciples. 2. That they ſhall encreaſe in knowledge of the truth, and in feeling the power and efficacy thereof, 3. That they ſhall be made partakers of true Chriſtian liberty. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made to Chriſt will not hinder the ſucceſſe of his Goſpel, but even the contentions and debates occaſioned by malicious men, may do much good to many; for, <hi>as he ſpake theſe words, many beleeved on him.</hi> Even from amongſt the crew of oppoſers, he gathers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. 2. As it is preaching which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the mean of converſion; ſo in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, when men conſider, either the danger of Chriſts forſaking and giving up with them, or his own true excellency, as they are revealed in the word; it may be a mean to excite them to lay hold on him; for, this ſucceſſe followed upon his <hi>ſpeaking theſe things,</hi> which may relate either generally to the whole preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine, wherein he leaves them to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God of their deſpiſing of him; or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to the laſt words, wherein he points out his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with, and his being approven of the Father. 3. Chriſt is a tender cheriſher of weak beginners, and will rather take pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such as embrace Chriſt, do ſtand in great need of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhould be ſeriouſly affected with that great undertaking wherein they engage, Therefore doth Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not enough that men do embrace Chriſt for a ſit only, but if they would reap the benefit of piety, they ought to perſevere; And albeit ſuch as do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, may be kept a while without ſenſible feeling of the advantage of their courſe, yet, in due time, they ſhall finde it: Therefore doth he propound this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to them, <hi>if ye continue,</hi> and upon performance of that, makes the promiſe 6. They who would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere indeed, ought to cleave cloſly to the doctrine of Chriſt, not only renouncing falſe doctrine, and giving obedience to his truth, but as faith is begotten by the Word, ſo it muſt be cheriſhed and fed by it, and they muſt embrace and cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is the great priviledge of loſt ſinners, to be made diſciples to Chriſt, taught of him, and admitted to follow him and be in his company, as a pledge of their being with him for ever; Therefore it is held out as their encouragement and reward, <hi>ye are my diſciples.</hi> 8. As Chriſt hath ſome diſciples who are ſo in reality, and others who are ſuch but in ſhew only; So whatever external priviledges may follow on mens outward profeſſion and ſhew; Yet there is no true ground of ſolid comfort, but in being real diſciples; Therefore doth he encourage them with this, which only could yeeld true comfort, <hi>ye are my diſciples indeed,</hi> or, <hi>truly,</hi> and, <hi>in truth.</hi> 9. Albeit real converts be diſciples unto Chriſt from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their converſion; Yet that is oft times hid from them, till they give proofe of their ſincerity, by perſeverance, and then their faire advantages are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As all natural men, and counterfeit diſciples, are but ignorant of the truth of God, eſpecially of the power and life that is in it, and accompanieth it; So even ſound beginners may be for a time weak in theſe things; for, ſo is here ſuppoſed, that however they had ſome beginnings, yet they were yet to <hi>know the truth.</hi> 11. It is a very great advantage to get found and ſaving knowledge of the truths of the Goſpel, that ſo faith may cloſe with them, and men may be eſtabliſhed in them, and kept on truths ſide againſt all deluſions, and be made partakers of the ſweet refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that flow therefrom; Therefore it is held out as a rich encouragement, <hi>ye ſhall know the truth.</hi> 12.

Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> And albeit beleevers, and they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Chriſts Word, do not alwayes enjoy the poſſeſſion and uſe of this liberty, but may be under bondage, terrour, and fear; Yet that is not their allowance, but flows from their own we kneſſe, which apprehends all their bonds to be being on, when really they are freed from them: And therefore they ſhould complain of themſelves to God, and ſtrive for the uſe of what is their right, by walk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing familiarly with God, and chearfully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in his ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit ſpiritual bondage be in it ſelf ſo ſad and heavy, that to be free of it, might make all other bondage imaginable, look like freedome; Yet ſuch is the blindneſſe of men, that it is but little or not at all known or diſcerned, and they live in their bonds with as much delight as fiſhes have in their own element; for, this, in particular, was the point they were ignorant of, as knowing and feeling no ſuch bondage, and therefore carped at his doctrine. 5. Mens carnal apprehenſions of their own condition, or of Chriſts offer, or both, is a great cauſe wherefore they undervalue him and his offers, as a thing they ſtand in no deed of; for, ſo do theſe men carp at his offer to ſtumble theſe weak beginners, alledging that his offer of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was no great encouragement, ſince they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not. 6. Albeit Chriſts offers be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably rich, yet the way of offering and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his favours is ready to be a ſtumbling-block, while men cannot endure to have them by free gift, or as beſtowed on them who are miſerable without them; for, ſo much alſo may be obſerved here, they do not carp ſimply at his offer of freedome in it ſelf, liberty being ſo deſirable, but that they ſhould <hi>be made free.</hi> They do not indeed deſire to be ſervants or ſlaves, but free men, onely they deſire to have their freedome natural, and not adventitious, they would be <hi>free-borne,</hi> and not <hi>made free.</hi> And this holds generally true in all his offers; men can have nothing to except againſt the riches of Gods favour, grace, and righteouſneſſe, onely their natural pride cannot endure to have theſe things by free gift, to have them in, and by another, and not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp;c. And thus is it (however they palliate it) that makes ſelf-condemned ſinners ſtand out ſo long, before they cloſe with Chriſts offers, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the righteouſneſſe of God. 7. Mens external priviledges, in being born of religious parents and members of the Church, do oft-times prove a great ſtumbling-block to themſelves, hindering them from ſeeing their need of Chriſts offers, and from cloſing with them; for, they lay this as a ground to all their exceptions and their deſpiſing of his offer, <hi>We be Abrahams ſeed.</hi> 8. Such as do oppoſe Chriſt and his truth, are ordinarily ſo void of conſcience and awe of God, that they will make no ſcruple of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lies, ſo they may therby gain their point; And main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainets of truth ſhould lay their account for ſuch encounters and oppoſition; for, ſo much doth their ſecond exception, <hi>(and were never in bondage to any man)</hi> according to the firſt interpretation, teach. 9. While men are puft up with carnal dreames of their own priviledges and worth, and with carnal expectations of great things to be done for them; they will not attain to the right uſe of any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are put under by God; for, ſo much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do theſe words, as they are explained, teach.

And therefore they made no right uſe of their afflictions; but all their care was how to get out of them, till the Lord made their attempting thereof prove their ruine at laſt.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to think ſeriouſly of the danger that they may be excited to ſeek after freedome, <hi>verſe</hi> 35. 3. That the onely way to attain to true freedome, is by coming to him, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. From <hi>verſe</hi> 34. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever advantage wicked men think to reap by oppoſing of the truth, yet Chriſt will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint them, and will take occaſion thereby to make truth ſhine more clearly; for, whereas before he had ſpoken of their freedome but in a word, now, by reaſon of theſe debates, he explains that point of bondage and freedome more fully. 2. The matter of our ſpiritual bondage and freedome is a point of very great importance, and neceſſary that we ſhould ſeriouſly ſtudy and be acquainted with it; And a point wherein we muſt ſubmit to Chriſts verdict, how contrary ſoever it be to our ſenſe and apprehenſion of our own condition: Therefore doth he prefix his ordinary aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> to this doctrine. 3. Whatever be mens imaginations concerning their own condition; yet there is a more heavie bondage lying upon them, then any outward ſlavery that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them, even to be under the ſlavery and bondage of ſin; for, ſo doth Chriſt aſſert, that there are <hi>ſervants of ſinne,</hi> of whom he meant when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed freedome. 4. Albeit all men by nature be borne ſlaves to ſin; yet conſidering that there is freedome offered by Chriſt, and that they who embrace this remedy, are not in this life fully freed from ſin; Therefore Chriſt will not reckon men ſlaves by their having of ſin in them, nor yet by their daily fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and infirmities, or by their falling now and then
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48148:89"/>
in ſoul faults, through the violence of tentation; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they make a conſtant trade of ſinne, and be under the dominion thereof, without controlement; for, of theſe Chriſt ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>whoſoever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinne, is the ſervant of ſinne.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. And this is the condition of natural men, who being free from the yoke of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.20. do voluntarily, and without any oppoſition, (unleſſe it be ſome checks of a natural conſcience, ſtartling at ſome ſinne, or ſome thoughts of fear and ſhame) live in a trade of all ſinne, and under the ſlaviſh tyranny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though this dominion appear more evidently in ſome ſinnes then others.

As for renewed men, albeit they not only have ſinne in them, and do ſinne daily, but even have ſome particular evils that may be called <hi>predominants,</hi> in compariſon of others, (which may eaſily be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the great power and ſway that they bear, even in commanding other evils to be committed or forborne, according as may contribute to advance them; by violent and frequent relapſes of Saints into them; by their unwillingneſſe to admit of admonition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe for them; and, by their falling in them out of an inward propenſitie, when outward tentations are weak, or none at all, or very few:) Yet ſince, as to the ſtate of their perſon; they are ſet at freedome; and ſince the dominion is not univerſal, as to all ſinnes, nor is it perpetual or compleat, even as to theſe prevailing evils; Therefore they cannot be called <hi>ſervants of ſinne</hi> as unrenewed men are: Yea, albeit in reſpect of degrees of mortification in Saints, ſome ſinnes are more predominant then others; ſome alſo are more ſtrong in them, becauſe they are the general evils of the time wherein they live, or becauſe by natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and conſtitution, or by education, (all which may be a bridle to ſome evils;) they are left more obnoxious and open to them; and ſome are left to be an exerciſe and daily matter of humiliation to them: Yet I would not deny, but all the ſinnes of renewed men are their infirmities, not only in reſpect of Gods pitie, who will ſo account of them; but in reſpect of grace and the renewed parts ſuffering by them, which is greater under groſſer evils againſt light, then under ſinnes of ignorance and meer infirmity. However, this is to be ſo underſtood, that godly men are to watch eſpecially over theſe predominants, yet ſo as they take heed, leſt in watching over one of thoſe, many other evils that make leſſe noiſe, get liberty to grow up.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Such as will not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to conſider the ſinfulneſſe of their ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that they may be rid of it, ought, at leaſt, to conſider of the danger that followeth upon it, to ſee how that will affect them. Therefore doth Chriſt ſubjoyne that conſideration here, to excite them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him for their liberty. 2. The true difference betwixt ſpiritual ſlaves, and theſe who are made free, cannot be drawn from the enjoyment of external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Church, which the one may partake of as well as the other; for, it is imported that <hi>ſervants,</hi> as well as ſons may be <hi>in the houſe.</hi> As an houſholder hath in his family, not only children, but ſervants for ſeveral uſes, ſo hath the Lord alſo in the Church (which is his houſe, where he dwels and affords, his ſpecial preſence, and layeth up his ſpecial furniture) veſſels of diſhonour, as well as veſſels of honour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. 3. Whatever external priviledges the ſlaves of ſinne enjoy, yet at laſt they will be caſt out of all, and a ſeparation will be made betwixt them and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who are made free; for, <hi>the ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever,</hi> as the Sonne doth. He inſiſts in the metaphor of a family, wherein ſervants have tearme-dayes, and may be thruſt away for faults, and are laid aſide when the heritage cometh to be divided, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman was, after a long ſtay in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30. 4, It is the great advantage of theſe who flee to Chriſt, to be freed from the ſlavery of ſinne, that not only do they get their liberty, but are made ſonnes and children alſo; Therefore is he who is not <hi>the ſervant,</hi> called <hi>the Sonne;</hi> whereby we are not only, or ſo much, to underſtand Chriſt, (though he be indeed the natural and only begotten Sonne, through whom all the reſt are made ſonnes) as the adopted children. 5. Such as are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of ſpiritual liberty, and of adoption, have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the rich priviledge of ſpecial and intimate fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, and of being under his ſpecial protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and care, and provided for by him, as children in their fathers houſe; But this happy eſtate is enſured to them; ſo that though they offend, and may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, yet they will not be turned out of doores, as ſervants are; the doores are patent to let them in, when, like the prodigal, they have run away: And when they have been bred a while in the Church, which is the lower roomes of this houſe, and have fed upon the hope and firſt fruits of their inheritance, they will be carried up to the upper roomes of the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, there to get full poſſeſſion, and to enjoy God and his preſence immediatly and for ever; for, <hi>the Son abideth in the houſe for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit ſpiritual bondage be ſuch as we cannot ſhake it off, though we would; Yet loſt man hath this encouragement, that his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not impoſſible; for, here it is held out as a thing poſſible, upon ſome conditions, <hi>ye ſhall be free.</hi> 2. Spiritual bondage is ſo great a miſery, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from it ſo rich a mercy, that men would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delude themſelves, either with a conceit of any thing that may compenſe the want of it, or with an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that they are free, when they are not; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt excite them to uſe means that they may be <hi>free indeed,</hi> or, <hi>really,</hi> not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with outward freedome, as if that were enough, nor with an imagination of ſpiritual freedome, while as they remain real ſlaves. 3. Chriſt is the heir of the family, having power to make free what ſervants he pleaſeth, and none can ever partake of ſpiritual liberty, but they who flee to him, and receive it from him; for, <hi>if the Sonne ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> otherwiſe not.

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have the ſecond branch of Chriſts anſwer; Wherein he anſwers to the chiefe ground of their exception, taken from their deſcent from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> from whence they concluded that (at leaſt by right) they were freemen. In anſwering to this, Chriſt maketh uſe of the diſtinction betwixt <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh, and after the ſpirit, (of which <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. and 9.6, 7.) and declareth, That he would not deny, but that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal ſeed; yet that could availe nothing, ſince they did not follow his footſteps, but ſought to kill him, as an evidence that his doctrine had no place, nor reſpect in their hearts, which was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> way, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. And to inculcate this yet more. 1. He ſheweth, that the Word, which they deſpiſed, was the doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him from the Father, which <hi>Abraham</hi> would never have entertained as they did. 2. That their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage proves that they have another Original and father, whom they follow, then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that this their father is contrary to him and his Father, whom <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> worſhipped and obeyed, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. And by this he indirectly points out that they were acted by Satan, whom he expreſſely names afterward, ſeeing they would not underſtand him when he ſpake thus.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt, even in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with wicked men, is moſt tender and meek, and rather willing to gain then deterre them, ſo long as there is any hope; So much appeareth in his way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning here, for whereas in their other ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (wherein they alleadge they were never in bondage, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.) he had them at a ſeen advantage of an impudent lie, at leaſt of a vain imagination; yet after he hath cleared their miſtake about ſpiritual bondage, he doth not meddle at all with that exception, but only cleares that wherein they ſeemed to have ſome advantage of truth on their ſide. And by this alſo, he would teach all the maintainers of truth, to make it their great ſtudy, to clear and juſtifie it in their debates, rather then to inſult over adverſaries, to imbitter and eſtrange them yet more from the love of the truth. 2. Chriſts knowledge of truth is infinite, and he doth propound it ſo infallibly and irrefragably, that he knoweth before hand all that can be ſaid againſt it; for, whereas they thought to ſurprize him with his objection, he tells them, <hi>I know that ye are Abrahams ſeed.</hi> A finite weak man might ſee his own ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by meeting with an objection he dreamt not of, but Chriſts doctrine cannot be ſhaken by ſuch means. 3. Albeit external priviledges may be a ſnare to delude hypocrites, and make them conceit of freedome; And albeit Chriſt may make uſe of mens conceit of theſe priviledges, to convince them, and agreeage their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: Yet no priviledge that men can boaſt of, will make void Chriſts truth, concerning the ſpiritual bondage of men by nature, nor bring them into real liberty: for, ſaith he, <hi>I know that ye are Abrahams ſeed,</hi> that ye conceit of it, and expect much by it; but yet my doctrine ſtands true, and ye have the ſadder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make, who enjoying that priviledge, do not emprove it better, 4. A little of mens practice is a ſurer rule to try them by, then all their faire language or boaſted of priviledges; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I know that ye are Abrahams ſeed,</hi> but that will not avail to prove your point, ſince <hi>ye ſeek to kill me.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. 5. Mens cruel malice againſt Chriſt and his children, proveth them to be yet in nature, and under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne, whatever elſe they have to boaſt of; for, by this he proves them ſervants of ſinne, though they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>ye ſeek to kill me.</hi> 6. Whatever natural men and hypocrites pretend to, or ſeem to have, of eſtimation and reſpect to the doctrine of the Goſpel; Yet really it hath no place with them. Either they have no roome for Chriſt, or his directions or comforts, (as the word here imports) as being ſufficiently provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they think, without him; or, they think his doctrine but cold comfort, to wait upon and follow in a time of ſtraite; or, they cannot digeſt his ſpiritual inſtructions, as being ſo contrary to the dictates of fleſh and blood, and laying a neceſſity on them to have ſo mean a conceit of themſelves; or, they affect it, not, becauſe of his authority who ſpeaks it, but becauſe of novelty, fineneſſe of expreſſion, or the like external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; or, the affections they have, do not make it ſink down in their hearts, to take root there, and bring forth fruit, but it only fleets for a while in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; or, if they be never ſo clearly convinced, yet out of pure malice, they will reject and oppoſe it: Therefore ſaith he, <hi>my word hath no place in you.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19, 20, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15, 20, 21. 7. Where the Word is barred out, and gets not roome in mens hearts, there men are ful of miſchiefe, and prone to all evil; and particularly, where the Word preached is not received, men will readily turne perſecutors: Therefore ſaith he, <hi>ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my word hath not place in you.</hi> For not only is this a juſt judgement of God upon ſuch deſpiſers; but the frequent inculcating of the Word will irritate their corruption, and it will grow worſe and worſe. There is no member of the Church, how civil or diſcreet ſoever, but if he receive not Chriſts Word into his heart, he is ready to turne a perſecutor.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt as he is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Father, ſo is he upon all his counſels, and knoweth his ſecrets; for ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeak what I have ſeen with my Father,</hi> to wit, his eternal counſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning loſt ſinners, whereof I am made participant 2. Chriſt alſo is the faithful interpreter and revealer of his Fathers counſel, for his peoples good; and his doctrine is in all things agreeable to the counſel and will of God; for, <hi>I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father.</hi> And this, as it ſheweth the great priviledge

of the Church, to whom theſe ſecrets are concredited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. ſo it doth highly aggravate their contempt who reject this meſſenger and his meſſage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3. and 12.25. 3. It is not enough that wicked men be ſhewed their evil way in it ſelfe, but they ſhould be led up to ſee from what principle it flowes, and what the dangerous conſequents of it are: Therefore doth Chriſt lead them up here, to ſee what their malitious oppoſition unto him was, and whence it flowed. 4. It is one ſad mark upon wicked men and adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Chriſt, that as they are oppoſite unto him, ſo their oppoſition proveth that he and they are not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of one Father; Therefore doth he point out himſelfe and them as having different and contrary Fathers, <hi>I ſpeak what I have ſeen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have ſeen with your Father.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as with his own children it is otherwiſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 20.17. 5. Let wicked men boaſt never ſo much of their paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and priviledges; Yet their works and carriage do prove that Satan is their Father, by whom they are acted and guided, and whoſe wayes they do imitate; for, ſaith he, <hi>ye do that which ye have ſeen with your Father;</hi> where Satan is called their <hi>Father,</hi> not in reſpect of the ſubſtance of their nature, which is neither created nor begotten by him, but in reſpect of the corruption of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Likewiſe, while he ſaith, <hi>ye do what ye have ſeen with him,</hi> it is not be underſtood of any viſible communion and intercourſe betwixt Satan and every unrenewed man; but that they do according as he prompts and acts them. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Eph</hi> 2.2. and ſo do commit theſe evils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he fell before them, as is inſtanced, <hi>ver,</hi> 44. 6. It is a ſad and humbling ſight of natural mens condition, to ſee them acted and led by Satan, as effectually and really, as ever their bodies were, who were corporally poſſeſſed by him: Therefore doth Chriſt by this point out the odiouſneſſe of their caſe unto them. And if this were well conſidered, it might not only diſcover, how little wonder it is there be a great oppoſition be twixt them, and the children of Chriſt, who are led by his Spirit. But it might humble them to think that they are under the conduct of ſuch a guide, when they think they are only following ſome pleaſant or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courſe: And it might let them, who dreame of a change of their manners when they pleaſe, ſee that it is not ſo eaſie a matter, but as hard as it was to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the man that had the Legion of devils in him.</p>

                  <p>The Jewes do except nothing againſt the firſt branch of Chriſts doctrine, concerning ſpiritual bondage; but finding that in his anſwer to their objection, he had inſinuate that they had ſome father of whom he had little good to ſay: and being either really ignorant, or wilfully ſeeming not to know that Chriſt ſpake of their ſpiritual parentage and pedigree; they again lay claim to <hi>Abraham</hi> as their father, of whom Chriſt durſt ſay no ill, and ſo would render him odious as calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating holy <hi>Abraham</hi> Chriſt, in his reply, doth more clearly hold out that he is not ſpeaking of their carnal deſcent according to the fleſh, but of their original and parentage according to the Spirit.

Conceit of priviledges is a diſeaſe not eaſily cured, nor will men be eaſily taught or convinced of the evill of it; for, after Chriſt hath ſufficiently refuted this exception before, yet they will not be put from it, but repeat it again, <hi>Abraham is our Father.</hi> 2. It is an old trick of degenerate Churches and Church-men, to cry up the names of pious Anceſtours, to oppoſe them againſt the light of truth; for, ſo do they hold up <hi>Abraham</hi> as their <hi>Father,</hi> that any thing Chriſt would ſay of their parentage, might be repelled by that: and ſo do many, like them, cry up theſe from whom they have farre degenerate. But if theſe Saints departed knew how they were abuſed by theſe their degenerate ſinnes, they would cry, <hi>let them periſh from under theſe heavens.</hi> 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever external priviledges men may enjoy, by being born of religious Parents, and members of the Church; Yet true grace is not an hereditary gift, nor doth carnal and outward ſucceſſion make men partakers of ſpiritual priviledges: Therefore, albeit he had granted they were <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> ver. 37. by carnal generation and ſucceſſion, yet he makes a doubt of their being his ſpiritual ſeed, till they prove it better, <hi>If ye were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams children, &amp;c.</hi> 4.

Albeit <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal ſeed did enjoy many temporal, yea, and external Church-priviledges, by vertue of the Covenant made with him; Yet none are his ſucceſſours, as to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of peculiar ſpiritual bleſſings and priviledges, but only theſe who are followers of his faith and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in piety: And they who do ſo, may lay hold on all the ſpiritual promiſes made to him and his ſeed.

Albeit the Lord, in great mercy, will paſſe over the many violent fits of corruption in his people, which, through grace, and by fleeing to Chriſt, they get ſmothered before they break forth; Yet the Lord will judge of wicked men by their wicked endeavours and attempts, though they ſucceed not, ſeeing they are only withheld by ſome obſtacle from without; The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such is the perverſity of the world, and their hatred to the truth of God pointing them out in their right colours, that the ſervants of Chriſt need expect no caſe, ſo long as they are faithful in their truſt; for, ſuch was Chriſts lot before them, <hi>ye ſeek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth.</hi> 11. Wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed men can never attempt any violence againſt the ſervants of God, becauſe of their fidelity, but God will look upon the injury as reflecting on himſelfe who entruſts them; for this cauſe doth Chriſt ſhew that the truth, for which they did perſecute him, he <hi>heard it of God,</hi> and ſo their quarrel was in effect againſt God, the Author of that truth. And as this may deterre men from ſuch violent courſes, ſo it may ſweeten the bitter cup, when it is held to the head of any of Gods ſervants. 12. Let wicked men cavil never ſo much againſt Chriſt, or ſtrive to clear themſelves, yet he will not alter his verdict of them till they change their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Therefore, over again doth he conclude, <hi>ye do the deeds of your father,</hi> that is, deeds like unto his, and deeds whereunto he driveth you. 13. Chriſt is ſo milde, even to his violent enemies, that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, he rather deſires that they ſhould ſeverely judge themſelves, then that he ſhould deale too harſhly with them; And when he reproves any, it is their duty to ſet conſcience on work, to apply and enlarge the challenge againſt themſelves: for theſe cauſes it is, that he, now the ſecond time, ſaith only, <hi>ye do the deeds of your father,</hi> not naming who that father is, but leaving that to their own conſciences to gather, when they ſhould think ſeriouſly on the challenge.</p>

None can juſtly pretend any intereſt in God as his children, but they that love Chriſt, who in his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the expreſſe image of his Father, and in his office, is employed by him; for, ſo much doth Chriſts aſſertion and argument hold forth, <hi>If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth</hi> (or <hi>came out,</hi> pointing at his eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>and come</hi> (in the preſent time, as it is in the Original, to performe this office of Mediatour) <hi>from God.</hi> 3.

Theſe reaſons, given by Chriſt, wherefore Gods children ſhould love him, taken from his eternal generation by the Father, and his being ſent by him in Commiſſion, may further teach us in general. 1. True lovers of God will give a roome in their affections to others, according to the meaſure of their communion with, and intereſt in God; for, if the Fathers children do love Chriſt, who is begotten of God, and is the expreſſe image of his perſon, then they will alſo love others who are begotten of him, and bear his image in part, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. 2. True lovers of God will love to have intercourſe with him, and will love every Meſſenger ſent by him, and the Meſſenger for the meſſage ſake; for, that other ground, <hi>I come from God, and he ſent me,</hi> holds out this general, That they could not be Gods children, unleſſe they liked to hear from him, and liked theſe who bring the tidings.

It ſhould be counted no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, but the ſound doctrine of Chriſt, to aſſert that not onely they who boaſt much of pripiledges, but theſe who indeed are members of a true Church are nothing in reality and in Gods account, but limbs and children of Satan; ſo long as they are unconverted, and live in a wicked courſe; for, ſaith Chriſt of theſe Jewes, <hi>ye are of your father the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> 2. Such as will not take with a reproof when it is mildly given by Chriſt, do provoke him to tell it out in ſharper termes; for, they would take no notice of what Chriſt formerly ſpake in general, of their ſpiritual parentage, and now he ſpeaks it out, <hi>ye are of your father the devil.</hi> 3. Mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices will prove that they are Satans children, let them ſay what they will; And theſe do prove themſelves to be eminently his children, in whom he works the greateſt conformity to himſelf; for, Chriſt proves his own aſſertion, and refutes all they had to ſay againſt it, with this, <hi>the luſts of your father ye will do;</hi> and according as they were eminent imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of him, accordingly did they prove how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent they were among his children. 4. Satan is full of raging wicked luſts, wherein his children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted by him, do imitate him; for, there are <hi>the luſts of your father,</hi> wherein they do reſemble him. 5. Albeit Satan and his children do very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten get many of their luſts fulfilled in the world; yet through the reſtraining power of God, and Chriſts watchful providence over his own, many of their hot attempts are fruſtrated; for, ſometime they prove but <hi>luſts,</hi> vexing chiefly themſelves who have them, and <hi>ye will,</hi> or, <hi>deſire to do them,</hi> but can get no further. 6. God will not judge of Satans children by their actings and ſucceſſe onely, but by their deſires and endeavours; And albeit they be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtopped in their courſe, yet he will account them Satans children, becauſe of their obſtinate and wilful endeavours; for Chriſt proves the point by this, as ſufficient, <hi>ye will do,</hi> or, <hi>deſire to do the luſts of your father;</hi> for as yet they had gone no further then deſires and endeavours in perſecuting him. 7. As all unrenewed men are Satans children; So, in particular, all liers, deceivers, double mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bloody men, and eſpecially, deſpiſers and oppoſers of Chriſts truth, and bloody perſecutors, are Satans chief children; for, theſe are the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular luſts, whereby he proves them eminent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> of both which they were guilty. 8. This doctrine delivered by Chriſt, concerning Satans fall and practices, doth hold forth ſeveral uſeful Inſtructions, which I ſhall point out in this order. 1. The moſt excellent and perfect of creatures, being left to themſelves, and the guidance of their beſt perfections, will not be able to ſtand, or keep their integrity; for, ſo much appears in this example of Satan, who being one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creatures, yet being left to himſelf, he <hi>abode not in the truth,</hi> or, in his original ſtation and holineſſe, and in his cleaving to God, but turned aſide to a vain lying courſe, and to be a deceiver of others, as is afterward cleared. And he was in this defection, <hi>from the beginning,</hi> to wit, of mans fall; So that however he was created perfect in one of the ſixe dayes, yet before the fall of man he had left his firſt habitation. 2. The cauſe of Satans fall was in himſelf, who of his own accord left his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal holineſſe and ſtation; for, <hi>be abode not in the truth,</hi> but forſook it. 3. As ſince Satans fall, there is no ſpark of goodneſſe, holineſſe, or truth in him, (for, <hi>there is no truth in him;</hi>) So this depravation proves, that he is fallen from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he was created; therefore doth this come in by way of reaſon, that ſince God made all his creatures good and perfect in their kinde, therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that <hi>he abode not in the truth, becauſe</hi> now <hi>there is no truth in him.</hi> And ſo the Lord is cleared of his fall. 4. Satan ſince his fall is a great enemy to man, and full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice that man ſhould fill that roome from whence he fell; So much appears in his being <hi>a murderer and liar,</hi> and that <hi>from the beginning.</hi> He did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſoone, and continues long; ſo that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to remember that they dwell in a world where Satan is going about, full of rage. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mask Satan put on, in dealing with men; Yet he is but ſeeking their deſtruction, both of ſoul and body; for, he is <hi>a murderer.</hi> 6. Satans attempt and ſucceſſe upon our firſt parents, is a clear evidence of his deſignes againſt the children of men, and a ſad document, ſhewing how farre he may prevaile with the beſt, if they be left to their own free-will; Therefore is it peculiarly marked, that <hi>he was a murderer from the beginning,</hi> as a clear warning to all, from what he did to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> hazarding the deſtruction of their, and all their poſterities, ſouls, and bringing them all under the ſentence of bodily death. 7. Satans great engine, for bringing about his bloody deſignes, is, lying and deceits; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it ſubjoyned, <hi>he is a liar;</hi> And by this he prevailed with our firſt parents, ſubtilly calling the truth of God in queſtion. So that to give heed to his lies againſt the truth, is, in effect, to give up our throat to the murderer. 8. As Satan is a very ſubtile and crafty adverſary, full of cunning and ſleight to entrap the ſimple; (ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48148:92"/>
11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6 11) So he is, in all he ſaith, a liar and not to be truſted; for, ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>there is no truth in him, he is a liar.</hi> Therefore, though he transforme himſelfe in an Angel of light, and busk up his projects; Yet men are not to be taken therewith; And though he ſometime ſpeak truth (as ſometime he did commend Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.34. and his ſervants, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.17. and may bear in true challenges upon beleevers;) Yet he is ſtill to be rejected, as intending thereby to deceive. For by his commendation of Chriſt and his followers, he intended either to make them be ſuſpected, or to draw perſecution on themſelves by caſting him out, as befel <hi>Paul.</hi> And when he pleads Gods cauſe againſt his people, it is but to drive them from God; and when he chargeth upon them what they deſerve, his ſcope is to deprive them of all hope of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and perſwade them that they ſhall be dealt with only according to deſerving. 9. Satans ſinne is of himſelfe, and all the evil that is in the world, God is free of it, and only Satan, as the enticer, and we, as the conſenters, are to blame for it; <hi>for, when he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own: he is the father of it,</hi> or, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter and beginner of it, in himſelfe and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>

                  <p>Here Chriſt doth confirme his aſſertion, concerning their being of Satan; And, as before he had proven they were of him, and imitaters of him, in murder; ſo, here he proves the ſame in the matter of lying, ſhewing that they were like Satan in that alſo, becauſe they will not believe him and his doctrine, even becauſe it is truth. And upon this followeth the other, of their ſeeking to kill him becauſe he told the truth, <hi>verſe</hi> 40. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1.

                  <p>In the third place, Chriſt in this reply, doth vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelfe, and ſo prevents an objection, and aggravates their infidelitie; For whereas they might object againſt the former challenge, in <hi>ver.</hi> 45. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we beleeve thee, and leave our own Religion for thy ſaying whom we know not? Chriſt anſwers, that ſince none of them could convince him of any ſin, and his doctrine was the very truth, therefore they could not but ſinne hainouſly, in not giving him credite, whoever he were. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Chriſts publike Meſſengers are obliged to be irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and true in their doctrine; ſo this was eminently and ſingularly true of Chriſt, who was the ſpotleſſe Lamb of God and infallibly true in all his doctrine; for he was without <hi>ſinne,</hi> and <hi>ſaid the truth.</hi> 2. It is not ſufficient to condemne any, that malicious men do calumniate and traduce them, unleſſe they can alſo argue and make it out; for Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of his accuſers, that they <hi>convince him of ſinne,</hi> or, by arguing make it clear, that what they aſſert is true. 3. Chriſt was ſo perfectly ſpotleſſe and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that albeit he lay buried under calumnies, yet none of his moſt malicious adverſaries could ever make it good that he was guilty of one ſinne; for, ſaith he, <hi>which of you convinceth me of ſinne?</hi> 4. Albeit the blameleſſe carriage of men doth ſerve much to make away for their doctrine, and doth aggravate their ſinne who deſpiſe it; Yet ſhould not be a ſnare to draw others to receive any thing they ſay, unleſſe it be made clear that it is truth; Therefore, in grounding this challenge, Chriſt adds this to that of his ſinleſneſſe, <hi>I ſay the truth.</hi> 5. As the doctrine of innocent and infallible Chriſt ought, without contraverſie, to be credited; ſo their conſciences may look for a ſad account and challenge, who will not do ſo: for, ſaith he, <hi>If I ſay the truth, why do ye not beleeve me?</hi> And it holds out alſo this general, that no prejudice ſhould hinder men from embracing that which is held out to be truth.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt place, Chriſt concludes the diſcourſe with a ſad note upon them; And doth himſelfe anſwer that queſtion he had propounded, <hi>verſe</hi> 46. ſhewing, that the true cauſe why they did not beleeve, nor hear his word, was, becauſe they were not of God, which he illuſtrates from the contrary, and ſo leaves them again to conſider of whom they were. This aſſertion, as it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of grown up perſons; (for infants are ſtill to be excepted in theſe ordinary

rules) So albeit to <hi>be of God,</hi> be frequently underſtood of mens being elected from eternity; Yet here it is chiefly to be underſtood of regeneration, becauſe even the elect of God, ſo long as they are unregenerate, may be guilty of the ſame ſinnes with the reprobate, and particularly, in ſleighting the Word. Only, if we conjoyne theſe two, to reſiſt known truth, and to do ſo maliciouſly, (which was the ſinne of many of theſe Jewes) it cannot befall any elect: For though <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned wittingly, yet not maliciouſly, and though <hi>Paul</hi> ſinned maliciouſly, yet he did it ignorantly, and in unbeliefe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Word of God is a true touchſtone, whereby they may try their own condition and ſtate; for, ſo doth Chriſt here teach us. 2. Men have nothing in them by nature, that can entertain or receive the Word of God with any due reſpect, but what they attain to of that kinde, is of God, and not of themſelves; for he muſt be <hi>of God,</hi> by election and regeneration who will <hi>hear Gods words.</hi> 3. An elect child of God being renewed, as he is begotten by the ſeed of Gods Word, ſo in his progreſſe he will not reſiſt the known light thereof, but will receive and feed upon it; And whatever may be his fits of tentation, yet he will never reject it maliciouſly: for, <hi>he that is of God, heareth Gods words:</hi> He heareth it with faith, ſubmiſſion, and fruitfulneſſe; for, ſo it is oppoſed to <hi>not beleeving,</hi> ver 46. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. and 2.1, 2, 3. 4. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be that do not regard the Word of the Lord, but do maliciouſly reject it after conviction, they prove themſelves to be unregenerate, if not alſo reprobates; for, <hi>ye heare them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> 5. Conſequences ſoundly and ſolidly deduced from Scripture, are Scripture, and as valid a ground of faith, as the ground from whence they are deduced; for, ſo doth Chriſt here teach us by his own practice, deducing from that ground, <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words,</hi> this neceſſary and infallible conſequence, <hi>ye therefore here them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> And this pen-man is full of ſuch deductions, warranting this way of arguing. 6. Whatever affront men think to put upon Chriſt, by rejecting his doctrine: Yet the real ignominy redounds to themſelves; Therefore, however they laid all the indignitie of this oppoſition on Chriſt himſelfe, and on his doctrine; Yet he tells them it flowed really from this, <hi>ye are not of God,</hi> but lying in a reprobate unregenerate condition.</p>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have their firſt attempt; wherein, taking advantage of his ſharp cenſure of them, they charge him with being a <hi>Samaritan</hi> and poſſeſſed with an evil Spirit. They do particularly charge him to be <hi>a Samaritan,</hi> not only, becauſe they accounted the <hi>Samaritans</hi> the moſt impious of men, becauſe of their Apoſtacy from the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the true Religion there, (whereof they account him alſo guilty by his doctrine) but ſpecially, becauſe as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were moſt bitter enemies unto, and traducers of the Jewes (as may be ſeen in part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9.) ſo did they account of him, who durſt be ſo bold as to deny them to be children of God, and to ſay they were of the devil. As for the other charge, <hi>thou haſt a devil,</hi> it is true that elſewhere they do maliciouſly aſſert againſt their light, that he was guided and aſſiſted by Satan in his doctrine and miracles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. But here, it ſeemes, they only intend to retort his challenge, and do ſay, he had a devil, which prompted him to ſay they were of the devil. And ſo the challenge is all one with the former of <hi>a Samaritan,</hi> whom they looked on (as on all wicked men) as guided by an evil ſpirit, and accordingly, Chriſt anſwers both, in anſwering one of them. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Albeit wicked enemies to truth may, for a time, enter the liſts of diſpute, as if they minded to ſeek out, and follow truth; Yet conviction in debate will not gain ground upon them; As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in theſe Jewes, who when they are put to the worſe in diſpute, yet they come nothing the nearer to truth. 2. Unbeliefe and contempt of the truth will end in blaſphemy; And impious men, being convinced, will turne ratlers, and betake themſelves to perſonal reflexions againſt the perſons of men who maintain the truth, when they can do no better: for, ſo do they deal with Chriſt. 3. Wicked men can vent no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, calumnie;, or blaſphemies, againſt Chriſts ſervants and people, which Chriſt hath not ſanctified in his own perſon, being called to his face the worſt of men, a reproacher and enemy to the people of God, and one poſſeſſed with an evil ſpirit; As here we ſee. 4. There are none more ready to reproach Chriſt and his followers, as if they were poſſeſſed with an evil ſpirit, then theſe who are his real ſlaves themſelves; for, they who <hi>are of the devil,</hi> ver. 44. ſay of Chriſt, <hi>thou haſt a devil.</hi> 5. Such is the power of ignorance, pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>judice, or malice, when men are poſſeſſed therewith, that they will draw bad concluſions, and put hard conſtructions upon beſt actions; for, upon Chriſts uſeful and true doctrine, they think they do well to draw theſe bad concluſions, <hi>Say we not well</hi> (intimating they

They who ſincerely ſeek Gods honour, do prove that they are not guided and acted by Satan, whatever the world think or ſay of them; for, ſo doth Chriſt prove his point, <hi>I have not a devil, but I honour my Father.</hi> 4. Mens innocent lives and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is the beſt mean to refute unjuſt calumnies and reproaches; for, ſo doth Chriſt refute their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by his honouring of God in his carriage. 5. It is a commendable zeal for God, honour, when his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants will not ſuffer wicked men, who carry the devils ſtamp and image to father themſelves on God, as his beloved and dear people; for, in this, particularly, did he <hi>honour his Father</hi> here, in telling them plainly what they were. 6. As mens honouring of God will not ſtop the mouths of malicious ſlanderers; So their ſinne is very great who reproach them who do honour God; And particularly, this holds true of Chriſt, who cannot be diſhonoured, but it rubs upon the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; Therefore, ſaith he by way of ſad chalenge, <hi>I honour my Father, and ye do diſhonour me.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23.</p>

Such as unfeignedly ſeek Gods glory, need not be anxious about the reproaches they meet with, ſeeing God undertakes to ſee to that: Therefore alſo, leſt they ſhould think the want of honour from them grieved him, he ſaith, <hi>I ſeek not mine own honour, there is one that ſeeketh and judgeth.</hi> 3. As Chriſt did honour the Father in going about the works of his calling; ſo the Father did undertake, and hath now honoured him, and will avenge all the blaſphemies, and reproaches that wicked men belch out againſt him; for, ſaith he, <hi>there is one that ſeeketh and judgeth.</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is never ſo angry with his foes, as to forget his friends; Yea, he delights to conveigh his threatnings againſt enemies, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his children, if ſo be they will conſider their loſſe, and yet take hold of his offer; Therefore, inſtead of threatning, he makes a gracious promiſe, and that not only for the confirmation of any weak ones who were then hearing, but to try what ſuch an offer might yet work upon theſe wicked men. 2. Albeit moſt part of men make but little account of the matter of their ſalvation, and theſe who have any thoughts about it, are very averſe from crediting Chriſts naked Word, about the way to it: Yet Chriſt would have it looked upon as a weighty buſineſſe, and would have it out of all contraverſie that he will make good the Word which he ſpeaks concerning it; Therefore doth he premit his ordinary aſſeveration to this doctrine, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> that he may teach them, that it is no light or trivial matter he is ſpeaking of, and that he may remove all heſitation concerning the truth of his Word. 3. Such as would receive any benefit by Chriſts doctrine, ſhould not only hear it, but lay it up in their heart, and keep it in ſome meaſure of ſincerity in their life; for, it is required, that they <hi>keep my ſaying.</hi> 4. Albeit ſuch as cleave to Chriſt, and make conſcience of obedience to his Word, may meet with very many troubles, and may oft-times have very great fears about death, and their eternal happineſſe; Yet they ſhall be ſecured from eternal death, and all their other troubles, and bodily death it ſelfe, ſhall be ſwallowed up into victory; for, <hi>if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death,</hi> to wit, eternal death, and conſequently, ſhall get a good account of all the ſteps betwixt him and eternal happineſſe.</p>

Miſtakes of Chriſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his doctrine in a carnal ſenſe, gives occaſion to perſecutors of many cavils; for, upon theſe grounds doth their exception run, wherein they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo much. They think it abſurd enough, if they can infer from his diſcourſe, that he makes himſelf greater then <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets, which yet is the very truth; and they miſtake him as if he were ſpeaking of the firſt death, when he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond death 4. Chriſts enemies do falſely pretend to be honourers of the Saints, that they may bear him down; for, ſo do they here cry up <hi>Abraham and the Prophets,</hi> to make him odious. 5. Albeit Saints be truly excellent, yet they have no priviledge againſt bodily death, but muſt pay that debt; partly, to be a teſtimony that they are by nature heires to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and do carry a body of corruption about with them while they are in the world; and partly, that they may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a better life; for, even <hi>Abraham and the Prophets,</hi> whom they cry up as ſingular, <hi>are dead.</hi> 6. Such as do in a carnal way over-value the Saints, they prejudge Chriſt of his glory and due eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, ſo did they by their exceſſive commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, <hi>Art thou greater then our father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, &amp;c.</hi> And this diſeaſe is more frequent, not onely in them who ſet them up in Chriſts roome, to be ſharers with him, in leaving merits to be made uſe of by the Church, and in being Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of interceſſion; but in them alſo who doat ſo much on Saints, as they forget to give Chriſt the glory of any excellency that is in them, and who implicitly follow them, not conſidering whether they be following Chriſt in that wherein they follow them, or not. 7. Chriſt is truly ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and matchleſſe, and if all the Saints were put together, they are all nothing to him, and he can do that which they cannot all do; for, this (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the clearing of their miſtake of what he ſpake concerning death) is the clear anſwer to all their cavil, that indeed he is greater then all of them put together.</p>

Such as hunt after vain-glory, and ſeek after reſpect and eſtimation otherwiſe then God alloweth and approveth of, they do hunt a ſhadow, and that which really is of no worth; for, this is of general verity, <hi>If I honour my ſelf my honour is nothing.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. 2. Chriſt ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no glory but what the Father alloweth on him; And as he is God over all, bleſſed and honoured for ever, and as his humane nature is honoured, by being exalted to a perſonal union with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; So whoever diſhonour Chriſt, yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alloweth and hath conferred honour on him as Mediatour, to be a teſtimony how well he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the redemption of loſt man, performed by him; and to be matter of comfort to all them who ſeek to this exalted Prince, and matter of terrour to all his and their enemies: For, ſaith he, <hi>if I honour my ſelf, my honour is nothing, it is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that honoureth me.</hi> 3. What men have received from God with his approbation, and have his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for it, they may avow and maintain it againſt all oppoſition; Therefore doth Chriſt not deny that honour they alledged he took to himſelf, but he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows it on this ground, <hi>It is my Father that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me.</hi> 4. Albeit Chriſt be in himſelf God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and ſo is not capable of any acceſſe of glory: Yet it pleaſed him to condeſcend ſo farre, as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48148:94"/>
to obſcure his own glory under the vail of his fleſh and ſtate of humiliation, till he had perfected the work of Redemption; and to account of his office of Mediatour, and the dignity accompanying it, as great honour conferred upon him by the Father; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>my Father honoureth me,</hi> above <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets, that I can give life to them that keep my ſayings. 5. Chriſts greateſt enemies may yet be ſo preſumptuous and deluded, as to ſooth up themſelves, with a conceit of a ſpecial intereſt in God; for, <hi>the Father,</hi> is he, <hi>of whom ye ſay that he is your God.</hi> 6. Perſecutors, pretending to intereſt in God, do but proclaim their own carnal ambition and ſelfe-ſeeking, and that they do but lye and deceive themſelves; for, he brings this as a proofe of their ambition, and aſſerts that they were liars in ſo ſaying, <hi>I ſhall be a liar like unto you.</hi> 7. As none are more ready to boaſt of an intereſt in God, then they who know leaſt of him; ſo none can prove an intereſt in him, but they who know and acknowledge him as he is revealed in Chriſt by the Goſpel; for, ſaith he, <hi>ye ſay that he is your God but</hi> (to refute that) <hi>ye know him not,</hi> to wit, ſavingly, in ſo far as they knew not him as Father to his Sonne whom he had ſent, and acknowledged not the Goſpel to be his revealed will. 8. It is not ſufficient for proving an intereſt in God, that men do acknowledge God as he reveals himſelfe, unleſſe alſo obedience to his will be joyned therewith; ſo much doth Chriſt teach by his own evidences that he is of God, contrary to theirs, <hi>I know him, and keep his ſaying.</hi> 9. Such as are of God, and know him, ſhould confidently avow their right and intereſt, and it is as great a wrong in a child of God, to deny his right, as it is in a prophane man, to claime an intereſt; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, in oppoſition to them, <hi>But I know him, and if I ſhould ſay I know him not, I ſhall be a liar like unto you,</hi> who boaſt of an intereſt without ground. 10. Chriſt doth perfectly know the Father and his will, ſo that none can be deluded in reſiſting on what he reveals of him; And he was perfectly obedient to the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all things, ſo that nothing can be objected againſt them, who flee to lay hold on his righteouſneſſe; for, <hi>I know him, and keep his ſaying.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt anſwers in particular to the ground of their exception; and, comparing himſelfe with <hi>Abraham</hi> (who was greateſt, in their account, of any of the Prophets, they mentioned with him, and indeed was the father of the faithful) he proves that he was greater then he. For <hi>Abraham</hi> knowing of him, the true Meſſiah, to come of his ſeed, did earneſtly deſire to ſee that day, and did get a ſight thereof by faith to his joy and contentment. And by this he proves that <hi>Abrahams</hi> joy and comfort depended on him, and that he lived by faith in his words and the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, according to that, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. And on the other hand, he proves by this, that they were not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> true children, who rejoyced not in him, and in the day of the Goſpel. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt will make uſe of wicked mens boaſted of priviledges, to aggreage their faults, therefore doth he deſigne him, <hi>your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham,</hi> to wit, according to the fleſh, that they might ſee how far they were degenerate from him in manners. 2. The time of the Goſpel is not only a <hi>day,</hi> in reſpect of the dark ignorance in which the world lies without it; But it is Chriſts day by way of excellency. For albeit the Goſpel and Chriſt were known and embraced before, yet that treaſure was but couched, for moſt part, under dark types, and ſeen at a great diſtance, and ſinne and the law and the curſe did bear much ſway: But now free-grace doth eminently reigne and ſhine, and Chriſt in his own perſon did appear on earth in our nature, to publiſh theſe glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tydings more clearly; Therefore doth he call it <hi>my day.</hi> 3. Men were not ſaved before Chriſts incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by any thing beſide Chriſt; but as Chriſt and the Covenant of grace were known then, ſo men were made participant of him and his benefits by faith; for, ſo is clear in the matter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom it is ſuppoſed Chriſt was known, not only as God, but as Mediatour to be incarnate, otherwiſe he could not have deſired a ſight of him, and it is expreſſely aſſerted, that <hi>he ſaw his day, and was glad.</hi> 4. Such as indeed have heard tell of Chriſt, their knowledge will produce earneſt deſires after him; and ſuch as prize Chriſt and ſalvation by him, will look upon the time of the Goſpel, and his incarnation, as a very ſweet ſight; for, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hearing tell of it, he <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day,</hi> to wit, of my coming in the fleſh, as <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24. and this <hi>rejoycing</hi> preſuppoſeth and includes an earneſt deſire. 5. Even the beſt of men ſtand in need of Chriſt, and according as they grow in real goodneſſe, their deſires after him will grow; for, ſo even <hi>Abraham,</hi> that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint, <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day.</hi> 6. The ſpiritual deſires of Gods people may be, and (when they are well managed) are full of joy; begotten partly, by the eſtimation of what they deſire, ſeaſoned with hope that they ſhall come ſpeed in ſome meaſure; and partly, by what they do really enjoy who are ſincerely deſiring and purſuing, their very hunger proves a bleſſedneſſe, and that they do poſſeſſe in part. Therefore it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham rejoyced,</hi> or, <hi>skipped for joy, to ſee my day.</hi> His heart was warmed with the thoughts of it even in deſiring it. 7. The ſincere deſires of Gods people will not be fruſtrate, nor will a ſincere and cheerful pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord, for wiſe reaſons, may ſuſpend the ſatisfying the deſires of his people all their dayes in their way; and yet in effect be granting them in a way that is as good for them; for, albeit <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw not this day with bodily eyes, in its full accompliſhment, yet for all that <hi>he ſaw it:</hi> The Lord indeed ſuſpended the exhibition of Chriſt in the fleſh, till long after <hi>Abraham;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would have croſſed his purpoſe of reſerving that to the fulneſſe of time, to have done otherwiſe; (and Saints muſt ſtoop to quit their will, when it doth not conſiſt with Gods great purpoſes concerning his Chruch:) Yet <hi>Abraham</hi> got that which was far better then a ſimple bodily ſight. For albeit believers and the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48148:94"/>
Diſciples in that time had a double advantage, of getting both a bodily and ſpiritual ſight; yet a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſight of him, either in the word of promiſe, before he came, or in the word of performance, ſince his exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, is far beyond a bodily ſight of him, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, not without this, as was ſeen in the moſt part of them who ſaw and heard him. 9. The deſires of the godly, which ſlow from faith, are well ſatisfied, when they get more ground and encouragement yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and depend and wait on; for, <hi>Abraham</hi> behoved to believe before he could deſire, and now his deſires are ſatisfied with ſeeing more by faith. 10. Faith will ſee far off, and through many impediments, and will draw comfort from what is not only inviſible at preſent, but not to come for a long time; for, at that great diſtance, and through all theſe types, <hi>he ſaw my day and was glad.</hi> 11. A ſight of Chriſt by faith, though at never ſo great a diſtance, and under many vails, will bring true peace and joy, and will ſatisfie a believer, however he deſire often much more; for, <hi>he ſaw it and was glad.</hi> He was content of that, though his deſire was after more, and it did indeed bring true joy unto him, and made him (with the reſt of the Patriarchs) confeſſe they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.

Such as look on Chriſts outſide only, and his ſtate of humiliation, will never ſee his true excellency; And ſo many things are true of Chriſt as God, that fleſh and blood, and they who look on him as meer man, will think them moſt abſurd: for, herein was their miſtake, they look on him as man only, and therefore object, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and haſt thou ſeen Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi> 3.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter we have the hiſtory of Chriſts curing of a blind man with ſome conſequents that followed thereupon.

                     <hi>The hiſtory of this miracle may be taken up in this order.</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt the Phyſician and the diſtreſſed man meet together,</hi> ver. 1. 2. <hi>Chriſt conferres with his diſciples about the Lords end in afflicting him,</hi> ver. 2, 3. <hi>and about the neceſſity of his curing him, and that preſently,</hi> ver. 4, 5. 3. <hi>He works the miraculous cure,</hi> ver. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe, it is recorded that Chriſt coming from the Temple, doth on the way perceive and take notice of this man, whoſe diſeaſe was naturally incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> mankinde is ſubject unto many miſeries, and beſide the Spiritual plagues, and common miſeries following thereupon, it pleaſeth the Lord to leave ſome exemplary effects thereof, to be documents unto all; As here there is <hi>a man blinde from his birth,</hi> which flowed from ſinne as the fountaine cauſe and in-let, though Chriſt afterward denyeth, that Gods end in this affliction is to puniſh ſinne. 2. Difficulties and diſeaſes that are inſuperable and incurable by the ordinary courſe of nature, are yet not impoſſible for Chriſt to help, but a meet object for him to magnifie his power on; Therefore it is marked, that <hi>he was blind from his birth,</hi> that ſo he may ſet out Chriſts power, who cured that blindneſſe that by natural means was incurable. 3. When Chriſt and his followers are driven by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution from their ſtation and employment, they are but driven to their Chriſt; and the Lord, ordinarily, doth let perſecutors drive them away, becauſe he hath other employment for them, wherein they may do more good; Therefore when Chriſt is driven out from preaching in the Temple to malicious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent enemies, an occaſion of work and doing good is preſently offered him, and he is thruſt out, in Gods providence, that he may come and heal this man, who alſo doth afterward make better uſe of his doctrine then they did. 4. No heat of perſecution, or perſonal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and no throng whatſoever, will hinder Chriſt to give an affectionate look to one of his own in miſery; for, <hi>as he paſſed by,</hi> fleeing the fury of the Phariſees, <hi>he ſaw the man,</hi> and looked ſo earneſtly and tenderly on him, that it occaſioned the diſciples queſtion, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Yea, it ſeems this mans miſery (who afterward was converted to him) did ſo draw his eye to him, that he ſaw him, and took notice of none elſe that were on the way. 5. Albeit Chriſts people in their diſtreſſe may be blinde, and cannot ſee him, yet he ſeeth them, and his ſeeing of them will move him to pity, ſo much the more as they ſee not: Therefore is it marked that <hi>he ſaw</hi> and took ſpecial notice of <hi>a man which was blind.</hi>

                  <p>Followeth a conference of Chriſt and his diſciples before the working of the cure, conſiſting of two parts. In the firſt whereof, anſwering a queſtion of the diſciples, he ſhews what was the Lords end in afflicting this man. Chriſts taking ſo ſpecial notice of him, and (as would appear) his ſtanding ſtill beſide him, leads the diſciples alſo to take notice of him, and to move a queſtion, whether it was his own or his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſinnes that had drawn on this ſtroak, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And Chriſt declares, that in this ſtroak God did not intend ſo much the puniſhment of the ſinne of either of them, as the manifeſtation of his own glorious work, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in curing of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. For clearing this queſtion and anſwer. Conſider, 1. The diſciples queſtion is not concerning the principle efficient cauſe of this affliction, (for that was God;) but concerning the procuring and final cauſe of it, that is, whether he or his parents by ſome groſſe ſinne had procured this ſtroak, and God had ſent it on as a puniſhment for that ſinne. Conſider, 2. However there might be clear cauſe of conceiving him to be born blinde for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſinnes, (as it is to be cleared afterward) yet it is more difficult to clear, how that ſhould be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own ſinne, ſeeing he could not ſinne before he was born: But we need not, for clearing their meaning, recurre to that conceit of tranſmigration of ſouls from one body into another, and conſequently, that he ſhould be puniſhed for the ſins of his ſoul committed while it was in another body: For albeit this was an opinion among Pagan Philoſophers, and ſomewhat of it crept in among the Phariſees, as may be gathered, in part, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.2. and 16 14. yet it is conceived that they only held the tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteous mens ſouls into other bodies, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the wickeds, ſuch as the diſciples ſuppoſed this man to be. Nor yet need we underſtand them as conceiving that God foreſeeing what a ſinner he would be, did thus puniſh him; For whatever reference a ſtroak may have to a future ſinne, either to prevent it, or to cut ſhort their power, who would in proceſſe of time abuſe it; Yet affliction as a puniſhment is inflicted after the ſinne committed. Nor yet need we aſſert, that they looked on Original ſinne as the Phariſees do, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. (of which in its own place) never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor laying it to heart, but where it is evidenced by ſuch a ſtroak. But we are to conceive that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged original ſinne, and that this did deſerve the greateſt of afflictions and plagues, not only Spiritual, but bodily alſo, as is ſeen on ſome Infants. Conſider, 3. Chriſts anſwer is not to be underſtood. 1. As if he denied them to have ſinne, whereof all are guilty ſince the fall, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. Nor, 2. As if he denyed that affliction entered into the world by reaſon of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. Since if man had not ſinned, he had lived in a bleſſed eſtate, according to the Covenant of works. Nor, 3. As if he or his parents had not ſinne enough to have deſerved this puniſhment, if God had purſued it; for the wages of the leaſt ſinne is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Nor yet, 4. As if God did never ſend affliction as a puniſhment for ſinne, however he dealt in this particular: But the meaning is, that in afflicting this man, the Lord did not ſo much purpoſe to puniſh their ſinnes, as to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his own glory. And ſo he would draw them from their curious queſtions, to prepare themſelves to be edified by his cure. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Such as God hath a ſpecial purpoſe of love unto, may yet be miſtaken by his dear children, and get harder meaſure from them, then Chriſt will give them; As here the diſciples do to this man, upon whom Chriſt had mercy. 2. It is a great fault in Chriſts diſciples, being tenderly dealt with themſelves, when they give out hard ſentences againſt others, becauſe of their afflictions, and do judge of their guilt according to the greatneſſe of their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; Not conſidering that it is not diſpenſations, but the Word, whereby mens eſtate and condition muſt be tried; for, herein the diſciples ſailed, who being as yet the children of the bride-chamber, little acquaint with ſorrowes and griefes, and being little affected with the poor mans caſe, only deſiring to hold up diſcourſe, when they ſee Chriſt ſo diligently obſerve him, they would dive into his guilt and provocation, whereas no ſuch thing was intended in the ſtroak. Thus alſo did <hi>Jobs</hi> friends deal with him. 3. Whatever be the Lords forbearance toward ſinners; yet all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> do bring as much guilt and ſinne into the world with them, as deſerves the ſaddeſt of afflictions; for, their queſtion imports this truth, that <hi>this mans ſinne</hi> did deſerve that he ſhould be <hi>born blind.</hi> Origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſinne brings death, even on Infants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 14. doth deſerve eternal damnation; and conſequently, it needs not be thought ſtrange, if the Lord purſue it with temporal afflictions. 4. Albeit the Lord do not puniſh and condemne any eternally for the ſinne of any of their progenitours (except <hi>Adam</hi> in whom all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) unleſſe they do actually imitate them; Yet he may juſtly afflict children in their bodies and eſtates, which they have from their parents, for the ſinnes of their parents, and ſo puniſh their parents in them; for, this truth is alſo imported in their queſtion, that for <hi>his parents ſinne,</hi> he might be <hi>born blind.</hi> 5. The ſenſe of Chriſts words is not alwayes to be taken from what his ſpeech at firſt view would ſeem to offer; but a ſpecial reſpect is to be had to all the occaſions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof, for finding out the truth; for, ſo muſt we do here in finding out Chriſts meaning in this ſpeech, <hi>neither hath this man ſinned nor his parents;</hi> which being nakedly looked on in it ſelfe, would ſeem to contain an untruth, contrary to the tenour of the Scriptures, but being compared with the diſciples queſtion, and what himſelfe ſubjoins, the meaning is found to be, that God by this affliction is not puniſhing their ſinne. 6. Albeit all men be ſinners, and albeit every ſinne deſerve both temporal and eternal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48148:96"/>
Yet the Lord doth not alwayes intend the puniſhing and avenging of ſin, even when he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ſuch as are ſinners, but may be intending an higher end; for, this is the true doctrine and ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor yet his parents, but that the works of God, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the puniſhing of ſinne, and the end after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we finde in Scripture that God doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, that he may exerciſe his Sovereignty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over men, and that he may try the ſaith of his own, as was ſeen in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. And albeit in many caſes it will be a great difficulty to attain to this comfort, that Chriſt is not eyeing or purſuing our guilt, when we are under ſad afflictions; Yet we may ſafely follow this order. 1. In all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we ſhould remember that ſin is the coal from whence theſe ſparks do flie, and ſo (whatever be the Lords end, yet) we are ſtill to be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of ſin, as our duty, when we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. 2. Albeit the Lord do not purſue any of his own with afflictions, as enemies; Yet there may be many failings and infirmities, which the Lord requires they ſhould be ſenſible of, eſpecially when the rod is on, whatever be Gods end in it: And in obſerving this <hi>Job</hi> came ſhort, as <hi>Elihu</hi> teacheth, though he was a reconciled man wronged by his friends, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, 10. 3. The Lord may be pointing at ſin by afflictions, when yet they are pardoned, and may ſend out rods, on penitent and pardoned Saints, to vindicate his own glory, and make them more cautious in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So did he deal with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. with <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11, 14. 4. Albeit the Lord ſend ſome afflictions as puniſhments and corrections for ſinne, and ſome for trial of faith and other graces; Yet it is not the Lords minde that his children, being corrected for ſin, ſhould caſt away their faith, but when they take with their guilt, they ought to look on their affliction as a double trial of faith, having not onely the affliction; but guilt alſo, to wraſtle with; and therefore they ought to take eſpecial heed to faith. 5. Whatever a child of God be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look unto under affliction, either of guilt or trial; yet they ought ſtill to lift up their eyes above that, and to expect that ſomewhat of God is, and will be manifeſted in their afflictions, and that this is his chief end in afflicting; for, ſo much doth the Text expreſſely hold out, it is <hi>that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt;</hi> And the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſhould be the chief exerciſe of Saints. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 7. Albeit the Lord hath created the world, yet his alſufficiencie is ſuch, as he can receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from it, nor be bettered by it; onely it is a Stage whereon he doth experimentally manifeſt and make known what he is: for, this is his great end in all his works, and particularly in this, <hi>that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> 8, In Gods diſpenſations toward men, there are to be obſerved, not one, but many purpoſes and proofs of his attributes and workings; for, <hi>the works</hi> (not <hi>the work</hi>) of God are to be <hi>made manifeſt in him.</hi> His Sovereignty appeared in afflicting, and his mercy and power in curing him. Yea, by this ſo much appeared, as proved him to be the Meſſiah accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.5. 9. Albeit the Lord do gloriouſly manifeſt himſelf daily, in the ordinary works of his Sovereignty, power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; Yet ſuch is the ſtupidity of men, that this is but little obſerved, unleſſe he manifeſt himſelfe in ſome extraordinary works alſo; Therefore muſt ſuch an extraordinary diſeaſe and cure be, <hi>that the works of God may be made manifeſt.</hi> 10. The Lord will not take advantage of the diſtreſſes of his people, but onely that he may give them a proof of his love; And he doth involve them in infirmities and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, of purpoſe that he may let out his glory in doing them good; for, this man was <hi>born blind, that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him;</hi> And as thus he needeth our infirmities for him to work upon, ſo we may glory in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. 11. As the Lord hath divers ends in afflicting his people; So his ultimate and laſt ſcope will not be ſoone ſeene, but the afflicted may be kept long under a dark condition, ſupported by ſecret ſtrength, and an unſeen bleſſing, and little know the Lords minde till he himſelf manifeſt it; for, albeit Sovereignty might ſtill have been ſeene in this affliction, yet God had many other works to manifeſt, which were little dreamt of by this man from his birth to that day, till now Chriſt bring them out by his Word and work. Which may warn all to beware of raſh judgment, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, who, lying long under affliction, do keep their eyes fixed upon Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond part of the conference, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving anſwered their queſtion, doth now prevent an objection by ſhewing reaſons why he ſhould cure him, and that preſently, notwithſtanding any hazard might redound to him for ſo doing. As for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which the diſciples might have urged againſt his working this miracle, we have one propounded to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 8. Where Chriſt repeats this anſwer in part, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10. And here they might be ready to object, that being but even now in peril of ſtoning by the Jewes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 59. Why would he irritate them again by this miracle, and not rather lurk? Eſpecially, Why would he do it on the Sabbath, as it is <hi>verſe</hi> 14. Seeing the like practice had bred him ſo much trouble before, as is marked, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>and</hi> 7.23, 25? Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents all, by ſhewing that he muſt manifeſt theſe works of God (of which <hi>verſe</hi> 3.) by curing this man, and that preſently; For which he gives three reaſons, 1. That he is ſent with a Commiſſion to do theſe works, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.— and therefore muſt be diligently obedient. 2. That his affection to the ſervice did binde the tie, laid upon him the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>verſe</hi>— 4. For when he conſidered that there was a time profixed to him, wherein to do theſe works in his own perſon, (to wit, the time of his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48148:96"/>
life and Miniſtry) which being ended (as it was now ſhortly to expire) he could not have the like opportunity, therefore he would now be buſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all hazards. 3. That he is <hi>the light of the world, verſe</hi> 5. and therefore behoved to cure him. This imports, partly, that being the ſtore-houſe of loſt man, in whom the remedy of all their miſeries is hid up, he could not with-hold from them what they needed; and partly, being to manifeſt himſelf the light of the world, to cure their ſpiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he would not omit to confirme it by this viſible ſigne of curing a blinde man. This reaſon is amplified from the conſideration of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he exerciſed this office, <hi>as long as I am in the world;</hi> which is but an enlargement of the ſecond reaſon. And for clearing thereof, and of the whole ſecond and third reaſons, it is not needful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the doctrines, concerning mans miſery and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in blindneſſe and darkneſſe, or, that Chriſt is the onely and true remedy of this evil; for theſe truths in their full latitude have occurred, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 9. and 8. 12. and ought here to be conſidered onely with reference to the preſent ſcope, But whereas Chriſt ſpeaks of his day, and of <hi>a night coming,</hi> and that he is the light of the world, <hi>as long as he is in the world,</hi> the meaning is not that ever he wants light, or an opportunity of doing good unto his people; or that he was not the light of the world, both before his Incarnation, and after his Aſcention. But Chriſt by this points out, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his abode on earth, he was this light in an eminent way. Not onely ſpiritually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning his people, and doing great things for them; but perſonally and immediately, by his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence and external operation, doing them by his own hand; whereas this light ſhined formerly, and wrought in and by the Miniſtry of the Prophets, and after his Aſcention, by the Apoſtles. And ſo the force of the reaſon is, that Chriſt conſidering that he was the light of the world, immediately and in his own perſon, onely ſo long as he is in the world; and that he had a prefixed time for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about and doing good in his own perſon, which was now near expired; therefore out of his great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his people, and to any ſervice that might do them good, he would be buſie and omit no time. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Men are not to expect that they will get through with good and acceptable works, without many diſcouragements, which may weaken the hands of fleſh and blood; for, ſo is here imported, in that Chriſt obviates them. 2. Chriſt is ſo eaſie to be intreated and employed by his people, that he will neither be diſcouraged nor forbidden to do them any good that they need; Therefore will he not be hindered, but reaſons againſt all delayes. 3. Chriſts works are all of them the works of God, being all approven of him, and God employing him to do good, that ſo he might manifeſt his love to miſerable man through him, in a way moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his juſtice; Therefore doth he call theſe things that he did in the dayes of his fleſh, not onely his own works, but <hi>the works of him that ſent me.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. 4. Chriſt ſtood obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all theſe duties, which he did in the dayes of his fleſh, and being bound thereunto by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion accepted from his Father, for which he was to give an account; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me.</hi> 5. As Chriſt ſtands bound by obligation, to performe all the duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Mediatour; So alſo he did affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertake them, and employ himſelf therein; for, ſo much doth that addition teach, <hi>I muſt work while it is day.</hi> Opportunities of well doing in our ſtation, are not to be ſleighted, but taken hold of; for, we ſhould work <hi>while it is day.</hi> 7. It may excite us to improve opportunities of well-doing, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that opportunity being loſt, it is not eaſily, if at all, recovered, even albeit we ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work; for, when the day is paſt: <hi>the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> 8. Chriſt our Lord was ſo willing to be employed for the good of his people, that he ſtudiouſly improved all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and did ſeriouſly lay to heart the ſhort time he had to remaine on earth, that ſo he might employ it thriftily, and go about doing good; for, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to himſelf in this preſent caſe, that general conſideration, <hi>I muſt work while it is to day, the night cometh, when no man can work.</hi> 9 The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt as Mediatour, being given for the good of miſerable ſinners, is an argument with him, pleading that he ſhould lay out himſelf for their help who are in need; for, ſo is the force of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his argument, <hi>I am the light of the world;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt let out of that furniture, laid up in me, for the help of this man. 10. Chriſt, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous cures wrought upon the bodies of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, in the time of his being on earth, gave a viſible document of what he was, and would prove to needy ſouls who employ him; So much alſo is imported here, that he being <hi>the light of the world</hi> would give a proof of it, and invite ſinners to employ him as ſuch, by curing this blinde man. 11. The Sonne of God his manifeſting himſelf in our nature, and converſing with ſinners on earth, preaching and working miracles among them, was a ſweet and refreſhful light of conſolation to the world; for, albeit he be the light of the world both before and after, yet this is true in a particular and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent way, <hi>as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</hi> And this was that day of light ſo much deſired and longed for, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.23, 24. For this was the glorious manifeſtation of the love of God, when he became <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> and when God not onely dwelt with men, but in mans nature, and by his own preaching and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles gave proof of that fulneſſe of grace and truth that is in him. 12. Our Lord Jeſus is ſo reſpective of loſt ſinners, that he accounted it no ſmall favour to get his bride in his own immediate guiding, and did ſo acquit himſelf in theſe dayes of his Miniſtry, as might witneſſe what an one he was; for, ſo much doth Chriſts argument, drawn from this, import, <hi>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world,</hi> which imports, by way of Argument, theſe two. 1. That in his eſteeme it was a great favour to be thus in his own perſon <hi>the light of the world,</hi> and not to leave the miniſtration of his comforts to his ſervants, to be miniſters thereof; and therefore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48148:97"/>
he would be buſie in this his time of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it appears how much he delighted to be the immediate Meſſenger and publiſher of his love, in that before his Incarnation he appeared in humane ſhape, and ſpake himſelf with the Patriarchs, and when his Meſſengers do in his name ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the wearie, his love is ſuch, that if it were fit, he would come and be the Meſſenger himſelf. 2. That his bride being now, during this time of his Miniſtry, left on his immediate hand (the Prophets being ceaſed, <hi>John</hi> after awhile laid by, and his diſciples doing but little) it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite he ſhould be buſie, and guide her ſo, as ſhe ſhould miſſe no other, and he might let her finde what a difference there is betwixt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome and his friends. And indeed he is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſingular, and like himſelf, in his guiding and dealing with his own.</p>

As for this pool, of which alſo, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.15. it was a fountain ſpringing out from mount <hi>Zion,</hi> from whence flowed out the brook of <hi>Siloah,</hi> which watered a part of the City, of which, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

                     </gap>.6. And as divers allegories are invented by the wit of men on this miracle, (as if his making uſe of clay in this miracle did point out, that he could cure the man, who had made man at firſt of clay; and, that his ſpettle making the clay, did point out the efficacy and vertue that ſloweth from Chriſts humanitie, being now perſonally united to the Godhead) ſo, in particular, the ſignification of the name of this pool, which is, <hi>ſent,</hi> makes men conceive the name was given to it, with an eye to the Meſſiah, who is <hi>Shiloh,</hi> Gen 49.10. But as <hi>Johns</hi> drift in interpreting the name, is only (according to his cuſtome) to make his meaning plain; ſo the name ſeemeth to have been given of old, only in teſtimony that they accounted it a ſpecial gift ſent of God, to have a fountain or brook among theſe hills, ſo commodious for their City: or, becauſe it did ſlow out not conſtantly, but now and then, according as God was pleaſed to ſend it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts affection to needy ſinners, manifeſted in his Word, is ſuch as he will give reall proofe of it, according as it is needed; Therefore he contents not himſelfe to have ſaid ſo much of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. but <hi>when he had thus ſpoken,</hi> he works the miracle, and will give a preſent proofe of what he had ſaid. 2. Albeit it be our duty to pray when we are in diſtreſſe, yet ſuch is Chriſts compaſſion, as to give us what we need, when we have little minde of it, and ſo cannot pray for it; for, when the man is not minding at all the cure of his diſeaſe, but is only ſitting there to beg, then Chriſt conferreth this unexpected benefit upon him. And by this way of dealing, Chriſt gives ample encouragement to his own to pray in their diſtreſſe, being confident that he who prevents prayer, will undoubtedly hear them. 3. When Chriſt employeth any means for the help of the miſerable, yet the power that doth them good is not in theſe means, but in and from Chriſt; for, neither could <hi>clay</hi> heal, nor <hi>the pool</hi> waſh away blindneſſe, but that flowed from his omnipotency only. And therefore as we ſhould reſt on no means, ſo neither ſhould we be diſcouraged in uſing means appointed by Chriſt, ſo long as we have his promiſe. 4. Chriſt can bring about wounderful deliverances and mercies to his people, even by means, which ſeem improbable and contrary to nature; for, <hi>clay</hi> of it ſelfe is rather fit to put out ſeeing eyes, then to open blind eyes. 5. Such as Chriſt takes in hand, as his patients, he may make them ſicker before he cure them, and put them in a worſe condition to ſenſe, then they were before; for, ſo much alſo doth the application of <hi>clay</hi> teach, It addeth an external impediment to his natural blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and yet is all done in order to his cure. And thus it is alſo in ſpiritual conditions; the ſtrong man may make greateſt trouble when he is to be put out, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22. 6. Where Chriſt doth good to any, he will firſt try their faith, by their ſubjection and obedience to his commanded means, before they finde the comfortable iſſue; for, ſuch is his method here; He firſt puts him to ſubject himſelfe to have <hi>his eyes anointed with clay,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to <hi>go waſh in the pool of Siloam,</hi> before the cure be wrought. Whatever Chriſt may do in his ſoveraignty in grace, yet it is our duty to beleeve, as we would have his power and grace mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted on our behalfe, <hi>Marke</hi> 9.22, 23. And ſaiths firſt work muſt be ſubjection and obedience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10.—14. 7. Faith in Chriſt yeelds prompt obedience, and will repine at no command preſcribing the means of help; for, <hi>he went his way therefore and waſhed.</hi> And this (no doubt) flowed from faith given him by Chriſt (who, it may be, hath ſaid more to him then is here recorded) which made him quit the opportunity of getting almes on the Sabbath day, and eſſay ſo improbable like a mean. 8. As there is no difficulty too hard for Chriſt; So there are none who, truſting in him, ſhall obey and follow his preſcribed means, but they ſhall obtain a good, and the promiſed iſſue, were it never ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable; for, <hi>he went and waſhed, and came ſeeing.</hi> 9. If we compare Chriſts method in this cure with that which he followeth in curing another blind man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.22, 23, 24, 25. wherein he opens a mans eyes by degrees, and here it is done at the firſt act; If, I ſay, we compare theſe, we will not only finde this difference; that whereas Chriſt abode with the one, therefore he did it by degrees; but ſending this man away, and leaving him, upon the firſt act of his faith and obedience, he is cured; As indeed, Chriſt orders his diſpenſations according to the need of them he deals
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48148:97"/>
with: Such as he is to ſtay with in ſome viſible and ſenſible way, he may give them more work about the curing of their diſeaſes, that ſo they may employ him more: Whereas ſuch as he is to withdraw from, may get their buſineſſe more eaſily done. But further, It will be found that this is common to both, that being to meet with ſo great a mercy, as to be cured of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it is not wrought at firſt on either; but the one, with whom he ſtayeth, is cured upon Chriſts putting his hands twice upon his eyes, and this man hath a time of it, in going from before the Temple to the pool, before he be cured: Not only that many going with him, and obſerving him, they might be witneſſes of the miracle, but alſo that himſelfe might have time to be prepared for ſuch a wounderful and unexpected change. And ſo it teacheth, That great and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected mercies need much preparation to ſit us for them, as well as croſſes; that ſo we may be armed with ſtrength to bear them, and with grace to emprove them well.</p>

                  <p>In the reſt of the parts of the Chapter we have the ſeveral effects and conſequents that followed on this miracle. The firſt whereof (in this ſecond part of the Chapter) is among his neighbours and acquaintance, to whom, it ſeems, he returned with much joy, when he found not Chriſt in the place where he left him; whereupon followeth their conference upon this matter, partly, among themſelves, and partly, with the man himſelfe. The conference contains the reſolution of three queſtions. 1. Whether ſuch a cure had been wrought, and whether this man who now ſaw, was the blind man, who ſate and begged? This the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours cannot clearly reſolve, but ſome aſſert it, others alleage that he is only like him, till he himſelfe put it out of contraverſie, <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9. 2. The ſecond queſtion is, concerning the way of his cure, which they propound for further ſatisfaction in the matter, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. and he anſwereth <hi>verſe</hi> 11. wherein he is able to give an account of Chriſts name, which he had learned either from Chriſt himſelfe, or from ſome who had been witneſſes of what Chriſt did, and had led him to the pool. 3. The third queſtion is, concerning Chriſt the Authour of this cure; They deſire to know where he is, and he cannot reſolve them. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The glory of Chriſts working for his people will not be gotten obſcured, and it ſhould be taken notice of by all, as they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee it; for, this miracle ſhines forth among the neighbours, who ſeeing the man, draw forth the knowledge of it by conferences and queſtions: and by their means, it becomes more publike. 2. The Lord may ſo order his diſpenſations, even toward them to whom he hath a purpoſe of good, as one croſſe may draw on another, and many miſeries may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>yſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That ſo they may have much exerciſe, he may make their deliverance the more conſpicuous, and may make many mercies concurre in it; for, this man had not only been blind, but his blindneſſe had driven him to <hi>ſit and beg,</hi> that law concerning the poor, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.4. not being carefully obſerved in theſe times of confuſion and bondage, as appears alſo from <hi>Acts</hi> 3.2. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. 3. Even the many diſadvantages and miſeries that trouble brings upon us, may contribute in due time, to make Chriſts glory more conſpicuous in our help; for, that his blindneſſe made him <hi>ſit and beg.</hi> it contributed to make him more known, then if he had been the ſonne of a great man kept in a corner; and this made the glory of the miracle to ſpread the faſter. 4. When Chriſt lets forth proofes of his power and love upon any in their miſeries, it will make ſo great and wonderful a change, that they who knew them before, may readily miſtake, and hardly know them, their condition being ſo different from what it was; for, ſo appears in theſe neighbours, who differ in their judgements whether this was <hi>he that ſate and begged,</hi> or, if <hi>he is like him</hi> only. 5. Such as have gotten proofes of Chriſts favour in mercy, will not be aſhamed of their former miſerable condition before they were helped; for, they will ſeek Chriſts glory, and not their own in their deliverance: Therefore, albeit this man having now occaſion to change his beggerly condition, ſeeing he could labour for his livelyhood, might have let them continue in their uncertainties; yet he thinks no ſhame to profeſſe, <hi>I am he,</hi> and ſo puts them out of doubt, that it is he who ſate and begged.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough to take notice of any great work that is wrought, unleſſe we alſo take notice of Chriſt the author, and the way and manner of working it; Therefore when they are aſſured, that a great change is wrought on him, they enquire further, <hi>how were thine eyes opened,</hi> or, how was thy ſight given to thee? 2.

Chriſt is the Author of any good
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48148:98"/>
that is done to miſerable ſinners; and it needs never be enquired who makes the blind to ſee, the ſick to be whole, &amp;c. for, it is Jeſus who worketh all this: So much doth he clear, in anſwering their queſtion, <hi>Jeſus made doth and anointed mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. And albeit it be but a particular inſtance, yet it is a point of general verity. 4. Such as have but ſmall acquaintance with Chriſt, ſhould yet ſpeak to his commendation, upon the fruits they have found of it, that ſo it may prove an earneſt and pledge of more: Therefore, albeit Chriſt had made this miracle the firſt ſtep of his acquaintance with the man, (as is not unuſual with Chriſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his people, and begin acquaintance with eſpecial favours) and ſo he can ſpeak of him, but as a ſtranger little acquaint with him, but that he heard his name, <hi>a man that is called Jeſus;</hi> Yet he ſpeaks what he knows to his advantage, and ſo is afterward brought to know him bettter. 5. It is not enough, to ſet out the greatneſſe of Chriſts work, unleſſe alſo ſpecial notice be taken of all the weak and improbable means he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth to bring it about; Therefore doth he ſo punctually relate all the circumſtances of the miracle, <hi>he made clay, and anointed mine eyes, &amp;c.</hi> to ſet out his glory in it the more.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. A ſight of Chriſts glorious working ſhould learn men to enquire after himſelfe; for, ſo do they on this information; <hi>where is he,</hi> though in the iſſue they proved not ſo ſincere. But when men get notice of Chriſts glory and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will either be allured to enquire for him, that they may ſeek him to enjoy him, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9 — 16. with 6.1 or their malice will be irritate to ſeek him, to do him an ill office. 2.

Chriſt by his withdrawing and not ſtaying for the mans returne, would teach, 1. That true humility is an enemy to oſtentation, and to hunting after vain glory; for, to avoid this did he withdraw. 2. That Chriſt is not ſo much taken with the muddy affections, and raviſhing admirations, which a recent mercy may produce, as he deſires to have the ſenſe of mercies ſolidly digeſted, to bring out ſolid and conſtant fruits; Therefore doth he avoid all the expreſſions of the mans affections, which readily he would have poured out, when he came from the pool, and doth not manifeſt himſelfe to him till afterward, that he have more ſolidly digeſted it, and till he have yet more need of him.</p>

The time when this miracle was wrought, which had been omitted in the hiſtory it ſelfe, is here recorded, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. as being the ground why the neighbours brought the man, and upon which the Phariſees took occaſion to inveigh againſt Chriſt, 3. They examine the man concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumſtances of the fact, that ſo they may know what to do; And the neighbours (as would appear) having given a ſhort account that he had been born blind, and that Jeſus had cured him on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; The man in his anſwer only adds to what they had ſaid, and relates the manner how the miracle was wrought, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When ever Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to do a good turne to any, albeit they have but little acquaintance of him, yet they may expect that their friends and neighbours, who before pitied or reſpected them, will be ready to perſecute them, and deliver them up into the hands of the moſt cruel adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaties, of Chriſt and his followers; for, ſo befel this man, <hi>they brought him to the Phariſees.</hi> 2. Ill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will never be wanting, to keep up conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his enemies; for, there are who <hi>brought him to the Phariſees,</hi> to ſet them on edge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt. 3. Were Church-men never ſo vile and corrupt, yet their titles and eminent places will ſtill draw carnal men father to reſpect them, then Chriſt in his ſtate of humiliation; for, this was it that made theſe neighbours, <hi>bring him to the Phariſees who afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was blind,</hi> they are taken up with their eminent places and titles, and therefore do take their part. 4. When men are once engaged in a courſe of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and take delight in it; it is righteous with God, to give them up to many opportunities of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, till their cup be full; for, it was in Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48148:98"/>
that <hi>they brought him to the Phariſees.</hi> For, they had been Chriſts avowed enemies, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him formerly, and now this poor man muſt not be perſecuted but by their hand, that ſo they may be made drunk with blood and perſecution, ſince they delighted ſo much in it.

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Works of neceſſity and charity to theſe in diſtreſſe, are very conſiſtent with the due ſanctification of the Sabbath, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt ſo often work theſe works upon the Sabbath, to confirme this truth. 2. As no offence taken by men at the doing of neceſſary and moral duties, whereby Chriſt is honoured, ſhould be regarded ſo as to drive us from dutie: So, in particular, the offence of wicked perſecutors is not to be regarded, in doing of theſe things that may ſet out the glory of God: Therefore, albeit it was the old conteſt that he had cured a man upon the Sabbath, yet he will do it over again, ſeeing the work is neceſſary, and the doing of it then was an occaſion to manifeſt the glory of his work, by their oppoſition, whereof they had no occaſion, if he had done it another time.

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is but in vain for men to think, that their terrour will drive a man from avowing what he hath found in Chriſt, or received from him, unleſſe he be under the ſtrong power of a tentation; ſo much appeareth in this man. Albeit they were informed by the neighbours, (for the man needs not name Chriſt in his anſwer, of whom they had made mention) <hi>yet again they alſo asked him,</hi> as thinking their authority and terrour might cauſe him deny what he had ſaid before his neighbours, that ſo there might be no more of the miracle. But all in vain; for he avowes it clearly. And indeed, it is a wonder how he is born up in all this debate, ſeeing as yet he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew where Chriſt was, nor fully what he was; But as ſenſe of this favour obliged him to Chriſt, ſo it may be thought admirable, how much ſtrength, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ability, men may be furniſhed with, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Chriſts cauſe. 2. They who would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſpeak of Chriſts working, will but ſpill it in the telling, in compariſon of theſe who have ſenſibly found it in themſelves; Therefore doth he, in this anſwer, adde to their report, and lay it out fully, which (it ſeemes) they had but thought worthy to be mentioned only in the general. 3. Such as are ſenſible of Chriſts goodneſſe in his working, will look upon every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in it as remarkable: Therefore doth he ſo punctually relate the manner of the cure; <hi>He put clay on mine eyes, and I waſhed, &amp;c.</hi> not only that he might ſatisfie their queſtion, <hi>how he had received his ſight,</hi> but to teſtifie how much it affected him to dwell on every paſſage thereof. 4. Chriſts favours are ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and ought to be remarked that they are ſo; Therefore doth he not only acknowledge that he <hi>ſaw,</hi> but yet ſtill, <hi>I do ſee,</hi> as obſerving the continuance of the favour. 5. It is alſo required in men who receive favours from Chriſt, that the continuance thereof do not render them taſteleſſe, but that the ſenſe of their former ill condition, and of Chriſts mercy, be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that ſo the favours may be ſtill freſh: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth he ſay, <hi>I do ſee,</hi> to teſtifie the continuance of his affection and eſtimation of that mercy.</p>

Whatever boldneſſe and reſolution perſecutors may ſeem to have, in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their bloody courſes; Yet they have more vexations then every one knows, either among, or within themſelves: Therefore, albeit the Phariſees appear very reſolute in their dealing with others, yet here the Spirit drawes the curtain, and lets us ſee what differences and debates there are among themſelves. 2. Perſecutors will be ſo malicious and impudent in their calumnies, that no convincing arguments or apologies will ſatisfie them; for, albeit Chriſt had fully refuted this calumnie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. yet they maliciouſly urge it again, <hi>This man is not of God, becauſe he keeps not the Sabbath day.</hi> 3. The malice of perſecutors is nothing the more approven, that it is masked with a pretence of zeal; but is rather the more hateful, that ſo corrupt diſpoſitions ſhould be covered with ſuch a pretence; for, this doth not excuſe, but adde to the fault, that they ſhould let out all their malice under this cover, <hi>he keeps not the Sabbath day</hi> 4. Chriſts enemies are ſo far from giving unto Chriſt his due glory, that they eſteeme him the worſt of any; for, they are ſo far from acknowledging him to be true God, that they will not ſo much as acknowledge him to be <hi>of God,</hi> that is, to be either a Prophet or Meſſenger ſent of God or a good man approven of him; which is all one as to account him a vile <hi>ſinner</hi> and an Impoſtor, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the exception given in by others. 5.

And as we are not to conceive, that all theſe who plead for him, do believe him to be the ſpotleſſe Lamb of God; So we need not dip into the ſtrength of their Argument, nor clear how it is conſiſtent with what is elſewhere recorded in Scripture, that Satan can work wonders, and that Antichriſt ſhall come with ſignes and wonders; which though they be lying ſignes, in ſo far as they tend to the confirmation of a lie, yet ſome of them may be real in themſelves, though not paſſing the reach of natural cauſes and ſo not real miracles. But we need not ſtand to juſtifie all their ſayings and apologies, whereof God makes uſe to marre the preſent deſignes of enemies; and it ſufficeth us to know, that Chriſts miracles were ſo far above the reach of nature, and ſo evidently free of jugglery, that his very enemies, and they who had power to dignoſce upon deluſions, could not but be convinced. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. 7. Albeit truth be the only beſt ſecond to a man, and that which may make him ſtout; Yet nature is impudent and bold in maintaining errour, but if it be convinced of truth, it doth aſſert it but timoutouſly, ſo much may be gathered from their proceeding here. They who are againſt truth, are bold, and ſpeak firſt; But the other party come in laſt, and propound the matter only by way of queſtion. 8. Chriſt, when he pleaſeth, can divide the very Conclaves and Councils of his enemies, and raiſe a ſchiſme among them, that ſo he may put a ſtop to their violent proceedings; for, <hi>and there was a diviſion,</hi> or, <hi>Schiſme, among them,</hi> while none of the parties would cede to another.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular in their proceedings, is, their re-examination of the man concerning his thoughts of Chriſt. Seeing they could not agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they (whether the one or other party, or all of them, is not much matter) call the man again, to know what his thoughts of Chriſt were, who had done this for him: And he, according to the weak meaſure of light received, freely declares him to be a Prophet. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No rubs, or ſtops and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will break the malice of perſecutors, but they will ſtill to it again; for, when their former examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not produced unanimity among themſelves, they try the man again, to ſee if they can draw any thing out of him, to carry their point. And it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they would gladly have had ſomewhat out of the man, whereupon they might condemne Chriſt; for however perſecutors have ſo much malice as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt, yet they have ſo much terrour, as to wiſh others might have a prime hand in it. 2. Chriſts friends muſt not expect to have done with their trials at one eſſay, but that enemies, by multiplyed aſſaults, and many ſifting queſtions will labour to daſh and confound them; for, ſo do they with this man; after the former examination, they put him again to it with a new queſtion, <hi>They ſay unto the blinde man</hi> (who had been blinde) <hi>again, what ſayeſt thou of him?</hi> &amp;c. 3. When Chriſt hath done a good turne to any, it concerns them to conſider, what they think of him who hath done ſo for them; for, this their queſtion is in it ſelfe ſeaſonable, whatever was their aime in it, <hi>what ſayeſt thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?</hi> 4. When God draws forth weak profeſſours to trial, he can bear them up, though their knowledge be but little, and can make them endure many, as well as one aſſault; for, he is as bold in this as in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. 5. There may be, and is, more true knowledge of Chriſt in a poore man that hath taſted of his favour, then in a whole conclave of perſecuting doctours; for, he ſaith more to his commendation, and more expreſſely, then even they who pleaded for him in the council. 6. When weak profeſſours have ſaid much of Chriſt, and more then perſecutors can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; Yet they come far ſhort in ſetting out his true worth; for, he ſaith only <hi>he is a Prophet,</hi> which though it was much, conſidering his ſmall acquaintance with Chriſt; yet it is far ſhort of what Chriſt is.

Perſecutors are inceſſant in their malice, and endeavours to ſmother the glory of Chriſts cleareſt working; for, ſo do they labour to get it denyed that ever ſuch a miracle was wrought; and do expect that poſſibly his parents, through fear, may deny that he was borne blinde. 3. When men are led by malice againſt Chriſt and his truth, they will be ſo impudent, as not to give credit even to what they ſee, for, <hi>they did not beleeve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, that he had been blinde, and received his ſight,</hi> though they were already convinced of it, and had condemned Chriſt for curing of him, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. 4. In a time of tryal, not only they who are moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently concerned and engaged, but even others, may be brought upon the ſtage; for, not only the man, but his parents, are here brought out to give a confeſſion, <hi>they did not beleeve, untill they called the Parents,</hi> &amp;c. 5. Perſecutors are very ſubtile and politick, and know how to make uſe of all advantages, and tempers and intereſts of men, to bear down Chriſt and his truth; for, ſo doth appear here. They purpoſe to obſcure and bear down the glory of this miracle, and finding the man ſo affected, as they could not draw him to comply with them, they eſſay his parents, if poſſibly they, being leſſe concerned and affected then the man, might be moved and tempted to deny ſomewhat of the truth. 6. It is the palme of perſecutors, to confound ſimple men with multiplicity of queſtions, and to daſh them with their own prejudged thoughts upon the matter; Therefore do they poſe them with three queſtions at once, and do in their queſtions inſinuate what they were inclined to beleeve, <hi>ye ſay he was borne blinde,</hi> but we do not credite it.</p>

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Natural affections may go very far in natural duties; and particularly, natural affection doth oblige, and will lead parents not to deny their own children, in their greateſt miſeries or dangers, or for any fear: for albeit their ſonne had been blinde, and is now in danger, and albeit they knew not but the Phariſees might be offended at this, yet they freely anſwer, <hi>we know that this is our ſonne, and that he was borne blinde.</hi> 2 Natural affection and reſolution, how great ſo ever it be, will not carry men to confeſſe Chriſt and his truth, when there is any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it; for, how ſtoutly ſo ever they own their ſonne, yet for what concerned Chriſt, they ſhift it, <hi>By what means he now ſeeth we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we know not.</hi> Wherein, whatever may be ſaid in their behalfe, from what followeth, that they deſire not the glory of the miracle to be obſcured, but remit them to the fitteſt witneſſe of it; Yet they ſinne hainouſly, by denying their knowledge, and by their ingratitude, in not avowing Chriſt who had conferred ſo notable a benefit upon them, in the perſon of their ſonne. 3. Albeit men may hazard much for their friends in their private quarrels; Yet ſuch as are not ſtout for Chriſt, will decline ſuffering in their own perſon, though they ſhould hazard their deareſt friends; and will let them ſuffer their alone, and it is well they prove not their greateſt enemies; for, they by ſhifting trouble, do expoſe their ſonne to it, <hi>he is of age, aske him, he ſhall ſpeak for himſelfe,</hi> as being from under their charge, and able to give an account of his own wayes. And albeit it had not been lawful for them to obtrude themſelves on ſuffering; yet when they are called to give a confeſſion, it was their fault to deſert not only the truth, but their ſon alſo.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Excommunication from the ſocietie of the people of God is an ancient and lawful ordinance in the houſe of God, however is be abuſed by men; for, it was an Ordinance, even in the Church of the Jewes, to <hi>put men out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</hi> See <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.8. 2. The beſt and moſt neceſſary Ordinances of God may be abuſed by wicked men, and the authority of his judicatories, and the edge of his cenſures ill imployed, when Church-Rulers are corrupt; for, ſo it was here, in their councill they had agreed to employ their authority, and the cenſures of the Church, to bear down Chriſt. This ſhould teach men, not to reject everything, which the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men do abuſe. 3. Albeit the child of God may, for ſome miſcarriages, fall under the cenſure of excommunication; Yet it is an evidence of a corrupt time, when the edge of that cenſure is turned againſt the children of the houſe, merely becauſe of their adhering to Chriſt: for, ſo was it here, <hi>they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed already, that if any man did confeſſe that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi> It is ſaid, they <hi>had agreed,</hi> albeit there was not only a <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> and <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> among them, but ſome others who thought more favourably of Chriſt,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48148:100"/>
as would appear from, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 42. And that becauſe the corrupt part did agree; or, theſe who were more honeſt being abſent, others would not ſtand out againſt the common determination, however they had argued the cauſe; Or, fear did make them agree that he ſhould not be acknowledged for the Meſſiah, however they had accounted him a good man. 4. Excommunication is a cenſure not a little terrible, when it is inflicted upon juſt grounds; for, whatever weakneſſe was in their fear, (of which afterward) yet it is an evidence that the members of the Jewiſh Church did generally fear to undergo this cenſure. 5. Men, through long cuſtome and formality, may be brought to ſtand in aw of Church cenſures, who yet give no evidence, that they ſtand in aw to ſinne againſt God, but rather of the contrary; for, however it be good in it ſelfe to be affraid of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Yet (beſides that this was an unjuſt decree) their ſhifting to confeſſe the truth, ſhews how they durſt hazard on ſinne, and yet they fear excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It may be, indeed, that ſome outward incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences followed upon this cenſure, which made them ſo carefully avoid it, as is true in the caſe of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. But as that is not the right cauſe wherefore Church-cenſures ſhould be dreadful; ſo though there were no ſuch thing, yet there are many who would not willingly be ſecluded from the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Church members, nor from the Ordinances, who yet never long after God in them, nor do lay to heart that they may be judicially bound in heaven, though they be not bound on earth. 6, Albeit juſt Excommunication be a ſad ſentence; yea, albeit when it is unjuſtly inflicted by a true viſible Church, it be ſo grievous, as men ſhould not willingly deſire it, and ſhould be affected with it; Yet it is but a ſlaviſh and ſinful fear, when men are hindered to confeſſe truth, becauſe men will excommunicate them; for, herein did the mans parents fail, in that for fear of this ſentence, they declined their dutie: And as carnal courage is but faint hearted in Chriſts matters, however it may be invincible in other difficulties, So ſlaviſh fear of this and the like inconveniences, is baſe, and will prove an enemy to ſuffering, unleſſe it be well ballanced with ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3. 7. They had decreed only, that <hi>if any man did confeſſe that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue,</hi> and yet this makes them affraid ſo much as to confeſſe that Chriſt had cured their ſonne. The reaſon may be conceived, that the Rulers were ſo malicious, that a favourable word ſpoken of Chriſt, was as much as if they had confeſſed him to be the Meſſiah: As indeed, In perſecutors account, it is ſufficient to render men as bad as may be, if they be any thing more charitable, or not ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as themſelves. Yet ſeeing they do not inflict this cenſure on theſe among themſelves who pleaded for him, at leaſt as not a ſinner, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Nor do they excommunicate the man for all his free confeſſion, till (as they conceive) he carry himſelfe unreverently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. Therefore it may be conceived rather that their fear was ſo ſlaviſh, as they durſt not ſo much as confeſſe that truth, which they might confeſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard; And ſo it teacheth, That ſlaviſh fear is a very brutiſh paſſion, and will not only be moved at real hazards, but will multiply many imagined dangers. And when men are poſſeſſed and led by it, they will not only do all that perſecutors by their decrees require, but it will drive them even from duties which they might follow without hazard.</p>

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the malicious deſignes of enemies, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe who are called to make confeſſion of the truth; Yet the Lord can keep his own glory from ſuffering prejudice, and enemies from getting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: for, ſo did it prove here. Albeit the Rulers thought to have gained much by putting his parents to it, and they did indeed come ſhort in their duty; Yet the matter is ſo ordered, as they gain no ground againſt Chriſt, and are put to eſſay other means. 2. Such as receive moſt eminent favours at Chriſts hand, muſt look to ſhare in trials beyond others; for, albeit his parents get one aſſault, as having ſhared in the favour conferred on their ſonne; yet his ſhare being much more in the mercy, his trials are oftner renewed, <hi>Then againe called they the man that was blinde.</hi> He behoved to get a trial according to the meaſure of mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and withall, the Lord would breed him in this firſt School, till he came to be ſitted for a new proofe of Chriſt, and till the perſecutors get a greater daſh by him; as the iſſue made clear. 3. Among other trials from perſecutors, this is one, that they will ſmoothly inſinuate with ſuch as confeſſe Chriſt, if ſo be they may pervert them by that means; for, here they lay aſide all harſhneſſe, and ſpeak him faire. 4. It is no ſtrange thing, to ſee men pretend to aime at nothing but the honour of God, when yet they are maliciouſly oppoſing Chriſt, his glory and truth; And this is one of perſecutors policies, whereby they labour to enſnare the ſimple: Therefore they pretend
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48148:100"/>
that, in all this, they aime at nothing but that he would <hi>give God the praiſe.</hi> 5. The confeſſion of the truth of any thing, whereof men are guilty, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an honouring of God; when they are called to it; not onely in ſo far as it glorifieth his juſtice in what he ſhall inflict for it, but in ſo far alſo as it giveth him the glory of knowing what is ſecret, and of being a puniſher of lying and diſſimulation: Therefore do they urge him to a confeſſion in theſe termes, <hi>give God the praiſe.</hi> 6. Such is the perverſity of Chriſts enemies, that they will not onely load him with unjuſt calumnies, but will obtrude their judgment and opinion (if they be men in power) upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to pre-judge them in their free confeſſion; Therefore, albeit they require a free confeſſion, yet they pre-limit him, by obtruding their opinion, as infallible, upon him, <hi>we know that this man is a ſinner,</hi> that is, albeit thou be deluded ſo far as to think him a Prophet, yet we, who have both au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and skill to judge, do certainly know he is a wicked ſinner. 7. It is the malicious cruelty of perſecutors, that they impudently brand Chriſt and his followers with calumnies, and yet will never give them a fair hearing, nor make them out upon them; for, albeit Chriſt had put them to it, <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of ſin,</hi> chap. 8. 46. yet they would never do that, and yet they will not give over to traduce him, <hi>we know that this man is a ſinner.</hi>

                  <p>The man in his anſwer, doth wave and paſſe what they had aſſerted concerning Chriſts perſon, but as to the matter of fact, wherein they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a confeſſion, he clearly aſſerts that he being blinde was made to ſee by him. As for his anſwer concerning Chriſts perſon, it may be conceived that it flowed from his weakneſſe and diſſimulation, in part, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>whether he be a ſinner or no I know not;</hi> Seeing he knew well enough he was no ſinner, in their ſenſe, as appears from <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>verſe</hi> 31, 33. So hard is it to keep our feet in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing trials; And becauſe of this his ſhifting, it may be conceived he is put to it, to ſpeak out his light more clearly afterward. But if we conſider the manner of the expreſſion more narrowly, <hi>whether he be a ſinner or no I know not, one thing I know &amp;c.</hi> it would appear that he not onely adherers to the confeſſion of what Chriſt had done, but brings a moſt convincing argument to refute their calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt his perſon, That let them judge of him as they would, yet he would not ſtand to debate it with words, when he could refute them by Chriſts deeds; For he, or any elſe, could not in reaſon judge him to be a ſinner, who had done ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a miracle, and he who had received a benefit, could not but think well of him; <hi>Wence learn,</hi> 1. It is a great injuſtice to calumniate Chriſt and his followers, when yet their practice and works do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe calumnies; Therefore doth he think their charge againſt Chriſt to be a ſinner, not worth the anſwering, when this miracle did clearly refute it. 2. Such as have received kindneſſes from Chriſt, will not have an ill thought of him, nor will the prejudices or opinions of any ſway them in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Therefore doth he reject all their thoughts of Chriſt, upon the conſideration of what he had done for him. 3.

No man can ſet ſuch a price upon mercies, or on Chriſt the Author of them, as they who have taſted of the bitterneſſe of wanting of them; Therefore, albeit the favour of eye-ſight be common generally to men, yet few are ſo affected with it as he, and that becauſe it was given him after he had wanted it long, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I was blinde, now I ſee.</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48148:101"/>
he ſaw they were not wearied, nor minded to give it over, he might be broken. 3. The manner and way of working any good work, is a ſpecial way to try, whether the doer of it be approven or not: Therefore do they ſo much inſiſt on that, <hi>What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</hi> If poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they might gather ſome ground of chalenging Chriſt; as working the miracle in an unlawful way. 4. Albeit perſecutors be politick, and confeſſors of truth oft-times weak and ſimple; Yet the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not onely give them courage, but wiſdome alſo to diſcern the drift of perſecutors; for ſo doth this man inſinuate that he knew it was for little good they were ſo inquiſitive. 5. It becomes the people of God well, when they perceive men dallying with truth, and Chriſts working, to put on an holy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeal; for, ſo doth he here with theſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who are ſo inquiſitive to know the way of the miracle, when they minde to make no right uſe of it. 6. It is the duty of friends to truth, not to foſter up enemies, with anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their needleſſe queſtions, propounded onely out of malice; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have told you already, and ye did not hear,</hi> or, beleeve, or liked not of it, <hi>wherefore would you hear it again?</hi> Since it is juſt the ſame it was. 7. They who were in eſteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, do, by their malicious oppoſing of Chriſt, become juſtly contemptible to the baſeſt, and may lawfully be touched in the ſore, by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowers of truth; for, here they are ſo abſurd, that he who had been a blinde beggar, doth taunt them to their faces, and lets them know how he ſaw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their malicious diſpoſition. 8. Albeit ſinners be invited to hear what God ſaith, or what is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his doings; Yet he will not be ſleighted by any: And ſuch as, out of malice, will not give credit to what they hear, it is juſt they be denied further information, and that pearles be not caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch ſwine: for, ſo is imported here, <hi>I have told you already and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again?</hi> 9. The right fruit of all we hear of Chriſt, is, to gain our conſent to be diſciples and followers unto him; and they who will not yeeld to that, it is juſt they get no more of his minde revealed unto them; for, ſo is imported in this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <hi>wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye alſo</hi> (among the reſt) <hi>be his diſciples?</hi> For, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that ſince they had no purpoſe to become ſcholars unto Chriſt, there was no reaſon that his glorious works ſhould be ſo much revealed to them.</p>

Corrupt men cannot endure to have their idols rubbed upon, and particularly, corrupt Church-men take it ill, when they are not in ſuch eſtimation as they would: Therefore do they raile on him, becauſe he did not give them reverence enough. 2. It is perſecutors policy, to caſt diſgrace upon the courſe they perſecute, that ſo they may ſhame profeſſours from it, Therefore do they upbraid him with being Chriſts diſciple, as a very odious courſe, which they would be very loth to joyn in, <hi>Thou art his diſciple.</hi> 3.

The beſt of men may be miſtaken and abuſed by their carnal ſucceſſours; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, it is a great wrong, when any inſtrument is cried up to Chriſts prejudice, and when men do pretend to the doctrine of the Scriptures, when they are rejecting Chriſt; for, ſay they, as a pretext, whereupon they do reject Chriſt, <hi>But we are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſciples. Moſes</hi> did ſet forth Chriſt, and he preſſed the Law to lead them to Chriſt, and ſo none could be his diſciples who were not Chriſts diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alſo; and yet they made uſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their adhering to his doctrine, to oppoſe and reject Chriſt. 5. Such as men do admit of as teachers to their ſouls, they would make ſure that they are called of God, and have their doctrine from him; for, this was ſound, though ill applied by them, <hi>We are Moſes diſciples;</hi> for, <hi>we know that God ſpake unto Moſes.</hi> 6, Such as are led by malice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt Chriſt, will not onely think baſely of his perſon, but will not ſee the clear evidences of his authority and Commiſſion; for, albeit this point had been often cleared before this, yet ſay they, <hi>as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,</hi> or who gave him Commiſſion.</p>

And 1. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds his reply by way of admiration, that Chriſt having wrought ſuch a miracle on him, yet they ſhould be ignorant of his authority, <hi>verſe</hi> 30. 2. He proceeds, by ſolid argument, to evince that his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this miracle proved he was of God. Wherin 1. He layeth down a general propoſition; that no groſſe ſinners, but onely ſuch as did worſhip God and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, would be heard or obtain things at Gods hand, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. 2. He ſubſumes in particular, that Chriſt behoved to be heard of God, having wrought ſo great a miracle, and ſo ſingular, that none of the Prophets, nay, nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom they boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did ever the like <hi>verſe</hi> 32. 3. From this he concludes, that certainly Chriſt was not a wicked ſinner, but of God, ſeeing if it were not ſo, he could not do any thing of that kinde, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. For clearing this argument, Conſider, 1. We need not be curious to evince the truth of this aſſertion, That Chriſt his miracles proved his divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, however Impoſtors and Deceivers may alſo work wonders; For, the greatneſſe of his works, and the way of doing them, were ſo convincing, that even enemies themſelves could not deny it, when they ſpake their real thoughts, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>John</hi> 3.2. nor could the greateſt enemies contradict it, unleſſe they maliciouſly ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24, 31. 2. while he ſuppoſeth that Chriſt prayed to God that he might work this miracle; we are not to conceive that he undeſtood who Chriſt was, or that it was his way to pray to the Father in the ſtate of humiliation, <hi>John</hi> 11.41, 41. But he onely looks on him as meere man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth ſo commend the inſtrument, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts the power of God in what he did. 3. While he proves Chriſt to be heard, becauſe he wrought this miracle, the meaning is not to prove that all that are not heard in an extraordinary way, are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; But this holds onely good in them who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to extraordinary callings, that they muſt prove it by ſome wonders; and doth alſo argue, that none who are ſo heard, are ſinners. 4. Taking this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion generally, <hi>God heareth not ſinners;</hi> it is not to be underſtood that even the groſſeſt of ſinners may not come to God to have their ſins pardoned and removed, and expect to be accepted and heard through Chriſt; But the meaning is, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard in other things, while they purpoſe to continue in their ſins. 5. It is alſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that in ſome reſpect God may hear even groſſe ſinners, ſo far as to give them many tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral favours, to their greater condemnation in end; as witneſſe his anſwer to <hi>Ahabs</hi> hypocritical repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27, 28, 29. Yet this that is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here doth alſo hold good, not onely becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God do for wicked men, yet he hates both their perſons and their prayers; or, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God do for the wicked at ſome times, yet the perpetual aſſiſtance and favour of God, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſt in all his life and actions, did prove that he was none of theſe. But ſeeing the man (as appears) knew not ſo much of Chriſt, nor doth he inſiſt on any other proof, but this one miracle: Therefore the very nature of this miracle, whereof the like was never done by any, did prove that he was of God. For however many miracles were wrought by Prophets before him, yet ſome ſort of miracles were reſerved to be done by him, to evidence that he was the Meſſiah. The words being thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reference to the preſent ſcope, from <hi>verſe</hi> 30. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Moſt learned men will grow blinde and abſurd, when they oppoſe themſelves againſt Chriſt and his truth; for ſo doth this man finde theſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to be. 2. Chriſt may give his weakeſt friends ſo much ſound knowledge of him, as will make them wonder at the blindneſſe and abſurdity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors; for, ſaith he, <hi>herein is a marvelous thing that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine eyes.</hi> 3. Such as are truly affected with Chriſts dealing, will wonder, and be ill pleaſed, that every one will not ſee as much in it as they do; for, he wonders, and takes it ill, that they are not ſo affected with the miracle, and with Chriſt the author of it, as he was.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 31. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts weak follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will not want a mouth, and wiſdome, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to plead his cauſe, and confound their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, in a day of trial; for, this poor beggar is enabled, ſolidly to reaſon againſt the Rulers, to their confuſion. 2. The generality of the viſible Church want not common and received principles, which being well emproven, might refute them in their many particular miſcarriages; Therefore doth he bring in a received principle, to refute them in this particular, <hi>we know that God heareth not ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore Chriſt cannot be a ſinner. 3. Such as would be approven of God, ought to be devoted unto him, to worſhip and call on him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in all things; that ſo they may come ſpeed in particular exigents; for, here it is required that a man be <hi>a worſhipper of God,</hi> and this makes way for his being heard in particular caſes, ſuch as this in debate was. 4. It is not enough to prove men religious, or approven of God, that they keep up a forme of worſhipping God, unleſſe they walke tenderly in obedience to Gods will, that ſo they may come ſpeed in prayer; and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſinne, in Chriſts account; for, here, to be <hi>a ſinner,</hi> and <hi>to worſhip God and do his will,</hi> are oppoſed each to other. 6. They only who thus worſhip God, and are not ſinners, will finde acceſſe to God in their prayers, and get anſwers to what they ask according to his will; for, <hi>God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth,</hi> that is, they who have extraordinary callings, will come ſpeed in extraordinary things, and others will come ſpeed in their lawful deſires, according to the tenour of Gods promiſes to hear his peoples prayers. It is one ſpecial mean to clear men in the matter of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal approbation and acceptance with God, when they employ God much in prayer, and ſo come to finde acceptance and audience from him: for, by Gods <hi>hearing</hi> a man, he cometh to gather that he is <hi>not a ſinner, but a worſhipper of God, and doer of his will.</hi>

Chriſt had many publike evidences, to witneſſe for him, that he was accepted and heard of God, in the diſcharge of his office; for, ſo doth he ſubſume, that Chriſt by this miracle had proven it. 2. Chriſt is omnipotent to do that which never hath been done before; And when any come to him with a diſtreſſe that never any had experience of the like, he can help them for all that, and make his dealing to them an experience to others, inviting them to emply him thereafter; for, <hi>ſince the world began was it not heard that any man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eyes of one that was borne blind.</hi> I need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate whether ever ſuch a cure as that was wrought before, (whereof yet we read not in Scripture) nor whether other miracles, formerly wrought, may be paralleld with it. For (beſide that Chriſt wrought it by his own proper power, not as the Prophets wrought miracles, though the man knew not this) it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſingular and great miracle; and whatever may be ſuppoſed of the mans miſtake; yet the general truth holds good. And the man, in commending it thus, doth evidence that he looks on Gods mercy in granting it to him, as ſingular, which is far from their practice, who undervalue the favours conferred upon themſelves, in compariſon of what is done to others. 3. Whatever wonders Satan and his inſtruments may be permitted to work, to draw men from the truth; Yet Chriſts miracles were ſuch, as did clearly evidence he could never have wrought them, unleſſe he had been approven and ſent of God, for, <hi>if this man were not of God, he could do nothing,</hi> to wit, ſuch as this work is.</p>

The putting of perſecutors to ſilence by reaſon, will not gain upon them, but rather drive them upon violent rage, as here we are taught. 2. It ſavours of phariſaicall pride, for men to account only themſelves holy, and to look on others is vile; for, ſo do they compare this man with themſelves. 3. It is the woful miſtake of men, that they do not take notice of ſinne, unleſſe they may grope it in ſome ſad afflictions; for, upon this ground it is that they ſay, <hi>Thou waſt altogether borne in ſinnes,</hi> as bearing the print of it, in being borne blinde. Albeit all have Original ſinne, yet, it ſeemes, they laid it little to heart, but where ſuch fruits of it did appear. 4.

                  <p>In the laſt part of the Chapter, we have Chriſt comforting the man after his excommunication, by two grounds of comfort, the laſt whereof he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains againſt the exceptions of ſome of the Phariſees. The firſt ground of comfort (in theſe verſes) is, by leading him to knowledge of, and faith in himſelfe the Sonne of God. Wherein is recorded. 1. That Chriſt hearing of his hard condition, doth finde him out, and propound an overture to encourage him againſt that ſentence; which is, to beleeve, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. 2. The man profeſſing a willingneſſe to beleeve, but deſiring to be informed, who was the Sonne of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. is reſolved and cleared by Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 37. 3. The
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48148:102"/>
man being thus cleared, doth profeſſe his embracing of him by faith, and in teſtimony thereof, doth worſhip him, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 35. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men by the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enemies may be driven to their thrift, to need and get more proofes of Chriſt; for, had they let this man alone, poſſibly this great mercy might have worne out of his minde; but by their toſſing and excommunicating of him, they put him to it, to need comfort, and ſo way is made for his receiving of it. 2. There are none of theſe who are dear to Chriſt, and have taſted of his mercy, but he hath an eye upon them, and doth know and take notice what lots they meet with in the world; for, this is not hid from him, <hi>Jeſus heard that they had caſt him out.</hi> 3. When Chriſts people are cruſhed with troubles and ill uſage, then it is his fit time to fall in and give them a tender viſit; when they are deſerted by all, they are left on him; for, at this time he ſeeks and findes him. He takes advantage to do him good in this ſtrait, as he had done formerly. 4. Chriſt will be at pains, to ſeek and finde his own in trouble, when they little know where to finde him; for, whereas the man knew him not, nor where to finde him, yet <hi>he found him.</hi> 5. Chriſt will draw near to them who are rejected of the world for his names ſake; and ſuch as are unjuſtly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, will be brought the nearer to Chriſt; for, <hi>he found him</hi> whom they had <hi>caſt out.</hi> 6. Men may be put to tryal with a leſſer meaſure of knowledge, and a further meaſure be reſerved for their encouragement when they are under it; for, he had endured a ſharp trial in Chriſts defence, before he knew him well, and now he is led up to know him to be <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> for his encouragement. 7. The main matter where upon Chriſt trieth his own, and their great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſuffering, is, faith in Chriſt, whereby communion with him is entertained; for, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this as his only cordial, and the mean to reap benefit by him, and tries him about it, <hi>doſt thou beleeve?</hi> 8. Albeit faith muſt take up Chriſt, in both his natures, and all his offices; Yet it never findes ſure footing, till it go through the vaile of his humanity, and finde him to be true God, and reſt on him as ſuch; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>doeſt thou beleeve on the Sonne of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his own, and ſpeaking to them, and yet they not know him, till he reveal himſelfe; for, ſaith he, when the Sonne of God is ſpeaking to him; <hi>Who is he, Lord?</hi> 2. Weak and ignorant profeſſours may yet have ſomewhat to witneſſe their honeſty; And namely, their ſenſe and acknowledgement of their ignorance; Some ſparks of love to Chriſt, though they know him not well, and a ſtrong deſire to beleeve, and a deſire after the knowledge of Chriſt that they may beleeve; which, in effect, is an evidence of begun faith deſiring growth. All theſe appear in this queſtion, proving the mans honeſty, <hi>Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeve on him?</hi> 3. Whatever good deſires there may be in the heart of one who is very ignorant; Yet true faith is not content to go on implicit grounds; but ſeeks for clear knowledge of the ground it goeth upon; nor can there be ſolide faith without ſound knowledge of that which we beleeve: Therefore he doth not pleaſe himſelfe with theſe beginnings, but deſires to have his doubts cleared, that he may beleeve indeed; <hi>Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeve on him?</hi> 4. The right end at which we ſhould aime, in our deſires after the knowledge of Chriſt and heavenly things, is, not barely to know and contemplate them, but that we may cloſe with, and embrace them by faith, for, this man deſires knowledge for that end, <hi>who is he, that I might beleeve on him?</hi>

                     </gap>re after him, he is not ſo far off as they may conceive, but really preſent; for, when he propounded the queſtion, little thinking where he might be, he gets a ſpeedy account, that he whom he deſires to know, is preſent with him. 2. When Chriſt hath manifeſted himſelfe to any of his people, it is his new gift to make them diſcerne it; for, ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt ſeen him,</hi> to wit, now with bodily eyes, and before this thou haſt ſeen his glory in the miracle, and yet he muſt be helped to diſcerne this. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 3. As Chriſt doth inſinuate himſelfe into the hearts and mindes of his people, by ſingular benefits which he conferreth on them; (as here he makes himſelfe known to this man, by his admitting him to ſee and hear him:) ſo it is his will, that they carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the favours he hath conferred on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore doth he ſay, <hi>Thou haſt ſeen him,</hi> or, art ſeeing him, that he may keep him mindefull of the mercy he had received, in recovering his ſight. 4. As it is of Chriſts great condeſcendence, that he ſtoops to ſpeak to vile ſinners; So the ſure way of taking him up, even albeit he were bodily preſent, is by his Word; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt ſeen him,</hi> and not only ſo, but <hi>it is he that talketh with thee;</hi> whereby he not only commends his own love that did ſpeak to him, but leads him not to look to his perſon only, but eſpecially to his ſpeech and doctrine. 5. The longer Chriſt keeps intercourſe with a ſinner, his manifeſtations of himſelfe will be ſtill the clearer and ſweeter; for, after he had made himſelfe ſo known to this man, as he knew him to be a good man and a Prophet, now he reveals himſelfe to be the Sonne of God, for his further comfort.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever may be the power of unbeliefe, when yet men have much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional knowledge of Chriſt; Yet when Chriſt reveals himſelfe to ſoules, it is accompanyed with ſuch power and life, that they are drawn to beleeve, and to confeſſe him, as they have a calling; Therefore, upon this ſhort information from Chriſt, <hi>he ſaid, Lord, I believe.</hi> 2. When one cloſeth with Chriſt by faith, it may and will put an end to all his perplexities and fears; for, this cures him of all his diſtempers in his trials, <hi>Lord, I beleeve.</hi> 3. True knowledge of the Sonne of God, and true faith in him, will beget much ſubjection, adoration, and reverence, and will draw the heart to do homage to Chriſt; Therefore is it ſubjoyned, <hi>and he worſhipped him,</hi> to wit, as God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond ground of comfort (which, it ſeems, Chriſt ſpake in the audience of all that were preſent) relates, chiefly, to the ſentence of excommunication unjuſtly pronounced againſt this man: Wherein by <hi>judgement,</hi> we are to underſtand, his authority to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrate the affairs of his own Church and people, as King and head thereof, leaving the judgement of compleat recompence till the great day. And the effects of the adminiſtration of this authority are expreſſed in tearms borrowed from the late miracle, in opening the eyes of the blind man, Such whereof as are comfortable, are the proper effects of his Miniſtry, and theſe that are ſad, are but the accidental effects thereof, flowing from mens own corruption. So the meaning is; That he was come into the world to be the adminiſtrator and Ruler of his own Church, and the diſcerner of true members from the falſe, which (though he had not yet taken the external. Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical keyes of the hands of the Rulers of the Jewiſh Church, yet) he did exerce in a ſpiritual way upon the ſpirits of men; by opening their eyes, who being ignorant, are humbled under the ſenſe thereof; and by diſcovering their blindneſſe, and giving them up judicially to be more blinded, who are puffed up with a conceit of themſelves. And by this Chriſt would ſhew, that the man had no cauſe to be troubled at their Excommunication, ſince it was not ratified in heaven; but on the contrary, his eyes had been opened to know more of Chriſt ſince his excommunication: Nor had the Rulers cauſe to glory in their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſince they were lying under ſo ſad a ſentence themſelves, in their ſpiritual condition. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt is ſupreme head and Governour of his Church, and doth adminiſtrate it juſtly, to the comfort of all theſe who are oppreſſed by unjuſt cenſures, and to the terrour of theſe who do ſo oppreſſe them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, <hi>for judgement am I come,</hi> to manage the government of my Church juſtly, that theſe who are wronged, and bound on earth when they are not bound in heaven, may appeal to me, and that theſe who wrong them, may expect a juſt recompence. 2. That which befel and followed upon the Goſpel in <hi>Judea,</hi> in the dayes of Chriſts miniſtry, is the ſame which may be expected in all places of the world where it cometh; for, albeit it was a particular caſe to which Chriſt ſpake in the firſt place, yet, ſaith he, <hi>for judgement I am come into this world.</hi> 3. Mens natural blindneſſe and brutiſhneſſe in the matters of God, through a vaile ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their hearts, is a great and chiefe part of their ſpiritual miſery; Therefore doth he inſtance his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, in the matter of making men <hi>ſee,</hi> or be <hi>blinde;</hi> not only that he may allude to the late miracle, but that under that, he may print out the great miſery of ſpiritual blindneſſe, and the mercy of illumination. 4. Men that are indeed ignorant in reſpect of others, and who are contemned by others as ignorant, do yet lie very near Chriſts help, if they be ſenſible of their want, and come to him with it; for, he hath a promiſe for them, <hi>which ſee not,</hi> that is, ſuch as this blinde man, who was really ignorant, and deſpiſed by the Phariſees as ſuch, and yet ſenſible of it, and deſiring to have it amended, as <hi>verſe</hi> 37. 5. Chriſt hath a remedy for all the greevances of ſinners; And particularly, he can open the eyes of the blind, and make them know him, and theſe things which tend to their ſalvation; for, <hi>for judgement am I come, that they which ſee not, might ſee.</hi> 6. It is a great plague on many, that they are ſwelled with a conceit of their own abilities, and ſo they are blaſted to them, and do obſtruct their own profiting by the Goſpel; for, there are, <hi>who ſee,</hi> that is, who have a conceit they ſee, or having ſome common abilities, do reſt upon them. 7. As the Goſpel will diſcover much to be but real darkneſſe, which before ſeemed otherwiſe; So they who conceit of their own light, will, in Gods judgement, be given up to reject the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſo grow more and more blinde: In both theſe re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt and his followers will never want obſervers, who lye in wait, to take advantage againſt them and their doctrine; for, albeit he had left the Phariſees <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 59. and the man was caſt out by them while they are ſitting in Council, <hi>verſe</hi> 34. yet <hi>ſome of the Phariſees, which were with him, heard theſe words,</hi> 2. Men may have abilities and judgement to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſts doctrine, and to apply it pertinently; who yet want grace to make right uſe of it; for, that they do underſtand his ſpeech to be ſpoken concerning ſpiritual blindneſſe, and do apply it to themſelves, is in it ſelfe right and imitable; and yet it produceth but bad effects in them. 3. It is an evidence of mens blind conceit of themſelves, when they will not beleeve their miſery, when Chriſt tells them of it, nor can they endure to hear tell of it, or to take with miſery, what ever advantage Chriſt hold out to them who do ſo;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48148:103"/>
for, ſay they in a rage <hi>are we blinde alſo?</hi> even we who are Teachers, as well as others? 4. However conceited men pleaſe themſelves in their own dreams; Yet it were their great advantage to take with that they like ſo ill: And their being ſenſible of miſery, were an evidence that they lay near mercy; for, albeit they could not endure to be accounted blinde; Yet Chriſt tells them, <hi>If ye were blinde,</hi> it were your greater advantage. 5. Let mens condition be never ſo bad, yet when they become ſenſible thereof, they are in the way to have the ſting taken out of it: And an acknowledged evil condition is nothing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mens ſwelling with conceit under it, and in reſpect that Chriſt will really heal and pardon ſuch: for, in theſe reſpects it holds true; <hi>If ye were blinde,</hi> (in your own eſteeme, and coming to me with it) <hi>ye ſhould have no ſinne,</hi> to wit, in compariſon of your guilt now, and I would really pardon and heal you, and it ſhould not <hi>remain,</hi> as is after declared. 6. Mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own condition as good enough, is a ſinne againſt the very remedy; as hindering them from ſeeing their caſe, and conſequently, they labour not to cure it, but do go on in it, and as ſtanding in the way of a pardon from Chriſt; for, <hi>but now you ſay we ſee: therefore your ſinne remaineth</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, I do not pardon it, and ye go on to encreaſe it daily. 7. There needs no more to make ſinners miſerable, but to let them go on and lie over in their ſinne, and not be helped by Chriſt; for, this is the ſad ſentence againſt them, <hi>therefore your ſinne remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>

                  <p>This firſt part of the Chapter containeth foure particulars; Whereof the firſt (in theſe verſes) is the propoſition of the parable, (as it is called, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) concerning the true and falſe ſhepherd, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from their contrary marks and properties; the falſe ſhepherd, chiefly, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and the true, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. In it ſeveral things occurre, to be cleared and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The occaſion and ſcope of the parable is breefly to be cleared. And for this end, it is to be conſidered, that the Scribes and Phariſees took it in ill part, that they were not looked on as the only Teachers of the Church, and they did diſclaime that Chriſt had any authority to teach the people, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 29. And in particular, they were grieved that Chriſt had not only aſſerted his own authority, but had inſinuate that they were blinde guides, <hi>Chap</hi> 9. 39, 40, 41. Therefore Chriſt, continuing his diſcourſe to the ſame auditory that were preſent, doth by this parable point out himſelf as the true ſhepherd of his ſheep, and conſequently, that he was the true Meſſiah, who had been promiſed under that name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. And he doth, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, point out who were not the true ſhepherds; under which deſcription are comprehended all theſe who either aſſumed to themſelves the office of the Meſſiah; or, who in their entry to an ordinan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y calling, were intruders and not of Gods appointing; or were, in their doctrine, erroneous; or theſe who albeit they had an external call, and preached ſound
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48148:104"/>
doctrine, yet were but hirelings, as to their fidelity in diſcharge of their truſt. And as for the application of this to the preſent Teachers of the Church of the Jewes, (which Chriſt doth in the firſt place intend here;) we are not to conceive that Chriſt doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his own doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2, 3. where he aſſerts their lawful calling, and mens obligation to heare what they taught according to the Word; For, albeit all that be true, yet they come in among falſe ſhepherds; partly, in ſo far as they were an order of <hi>Phariſees,</hi> not inſtitute by God; partly, as they taught unſound doctrine, and particularly, did corrupt the doctrine concerning the Meſſiah, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be had by him; and partly, as they were but mercinary and unfaithful, either in the exercing of any lawful calling they had, or in diſpenſing the true doctrine which they acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſts grave aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> uſed both in the propoſition of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. and the expoſition of it, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. may teach. 1 There is great need of frequent excitation and up ſtirring to heare doctrine, and lay it to heart; Therefore doth he, in whoſe mouth no guile was ever ſound, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.22. finde it needfull to ſtirre them up, by this grave introduction. 2. It is a matter of no ſmall importance to people, that they diſcerne who are their true ſhepherds, and who are but intruders to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: Therefore doth Chriſt propund it thus, as a weighty point. 3. Chriſt by his doctrine hath not only groſſe or open vices, generally condemned by all to reprove, but even theſe principles and courſes that ordinarily paſſe currant among all; Therefore alſo is this aſſeveration premitted, to ſhew that it was a very weighty point, and hard to be received, as being contrary to the general received opinion, that the Phariſees were the only true ſhepherds. 4. Such as are imployed to carry truth, ſhould publiſh it in a reverent and grave manner, and ſo as their behaviour give no occaſion to deſpiſe or reject it; Therefore, alſo, doth Chriſt, by his own grave way of preaching, commend this doctrine to the hearers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſts practice, both here, and elſewhere, in making uſe of a parable in propounding ſpiritual truths, would be conſidered. And this way of ſpeaking truth in borrowed tearmes, though taken from things known among men, did ſerve for theſe ends. 1. To make ſpiritual things plain and clear, being ſpoken of in tearmes borrowed from things wherewith we are beſt acquainted; So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. And as this doth commend plainneſſe in the way of preaching, and ſheweth Chriſts great skill and happineſſe in expreſſing his minde to mens capacity, (which was a fruit of his perfect knowledge, ſeeing it is but mens darkneſſe and confutedneſſe that renders them unable to expreſſe truth to the capacity of mean ones:) So alſo it puts us in minde, that it is our duty in obſerving theſe common things, whereof Chriſt makes uſe in preaching, to gather ſome ſpiritual inſtruction from them, as his practice doth teach. 2. Albeit the propounding of parables, being joyned with the explications thereof, did tend to make truth more plain; yet on the other hand, the naked propounding of parables without the explication, did keep the matter dark, and that in Gods righteous judgement upon malicious and wicked men, to whom the means of ſalvation do no good at all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, 13. 3. This way of preaching did alſo tend to inculcate divine and neceſſary truths; as being not only twice told, once in the parable, and againe in the expoſition, but uſe being made of ſuch obvious things, as might make the matter (being once underſtood) take deeper impreſſion. And herein, Chriſts wiſdome doth meet with an ordinary diſeaſe among men, which is, to receive but a ſlender im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of moſt materiall truths, which therefore they do eaſily let ſlip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. 4. This way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did alſo tend to beget and excite an appetite after divine truths, while as the hearers are held in ſuſpenſe in hearing the parable, and excited to deſire to know the explication, as was the diſciples frequent practice: And indeed, where there is much wealth of ſpiritual doctrine, nothing is more difficult, then to keep men in appetite after the Word, and from leathing of it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſomewhat is here to be ſpoken of the whole ſtructure and parts of this parable. For albeiet it were very impertinent to explain here the properties of ſheep, and their herds, and folds, in themſelves; ſeeing that is not the doctrine intended here, but another thing is pointed at under that repreſentation; And albeit it be only required in a parable, that the matter propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be purpoſe-like in it ſelfe, having its own parts, all ſuitable and agreeing to the fabrike of the parable; and that ſome of the chiefe parts, and the whole parable jointly conſidered, have ſome analogy to the purpoſe intended to be ſpoken of under that parable; So that to preſſe every particular part thereof to point out ſome ſpiritual purpoſe, is but to wreſt the parable, and the ſcope of him that uſeth it: Yea, albeit Chriſt in the explication, do chiefly inſiſt upon that of <hi>the door,</hi> and the true and falſe <hi>ſhepherd,</hi> and do ſpeak of the true ſhepherd chiefly with relation to himſelfe; Yet if we conſider, 1. That what is here explained is twice told, that we may be excited to conſider it again and again. 2. That what is not expreſſely explained, is yet touched in the by. 3. That this parable is not like to many others, wherein ſome purpoſe or thing is made uſe of for once, the ſcope whereof tends to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the preſent purpoſe; but this, for moſt part, containe nothing but the very ordinary ſimilitudes and borrowed expreſſions, whereby the Scriptures point out ſpiritual things and truths; and ſome of them are afterward repeated in this ſame Chapter, as familiar and plain doctrine. 4. That ſome things which are but hinted in the by in the expoſition, are more fully ſpoken to on the parable; So that we are remitted to it for the further conſideration thereof. If, I ſay, we conſider theſe things, we may hold forth the ſtructure and parts of this parable in theſe particulars, which are ſo many inſtructions. 1. Albeit the Lord might juſtly have rejected all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, upon the breach of the Covenant of works; Yet it pleaſeth him, from among theſe loſt ones, to ſelect unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſome to be veſſels of mercy; for, here he hath <hi>ſheep,</hi> whereby, (as is after cleared) are underſtood his elect and converted children, who are differenced from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48148:104"/>
reprobate goats, as will be made viſible at the laſt day. As for the reaſon of the name, and the reſemblances betwixt them and ſheep, ſundry may be brought, from their harmeleſſe ſimplicity, their cleanlineſſe, and profitableneſſe, their readineſſe to wander, their tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, &amp;c. But theſe may ſuffice us, which are recorded afterward in the parable. 2. Among other favours conferred upon Chriſts people, he hath, in particular, appointed for them the priviledge of a Church ſociety, wherein the elect are converted, and the converted live under his care and bleſſing, in the uſe of his Ordinances, till they be fitted for glory; for, the <hi>ſheep</hi> have a <hi>ſheepfold,</hi> which is expounded to be the Church, as may be gathered from <hi>verſe</hi> 16. It is but a needleſſe alegorizing, to gather from hence the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baſeneſſe of the Church in this world; ſeeing the ſcope is only to ſhew, that their Church ſociety is as ſuitable to them, as a ſheepfold is to ſheep; and that, however reprobates may be within the viſible Church; yet, the good of the priviledges thereof do redound only to the elect. 3. Albeit Chriſts ſheep are bound to watch over themſelves; Yet are they not altogether left to their own care of themſelves; but he hath provided paſtors for their better proviſion and ſecurity; for, there is <hi>the ſhepherd of the ſheep,</hi> Chriſt himſelfe and his ſent ſervants. Whereby is intimate, that they can no more ſafely want paſtours, then a weak flock can want a ſhepherd. 4. As God hath provided lawful Miniſters for the good of his people; ſo others are ready to obtrude themſelves upon them under that name, who have no ſuch warrand; for, as there is the <hi>ſhepherd,</hi> ſo there are <hi>theeves and robbers,</hi> who yet will ſeek the ſheep to follow them, and hear their voyce, as if they were true ſhepherds, as is imported <hi>verſe</hi> 5. 5. It is one clear evidence of a falſe ſhepherd, that he doth not enter in a right way, or by the right doore, but taketh ſome ſiniſtruous courſe of his own; for, ſo much may be gathered from this, that <hi>he entreth not by the doore, but climeth up ſome other way,</hi> of which more in the explication. And, on the contrary, the lawful ſhepherd <hi>entreth in by the doore,</hi> and <hi>to him the porter openeth,</hi> that is, (without ſtraining what Chriſt hath not explained) he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a known man, and enters with Gods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and in his way, as a porter openeth to him whom the Maſter of the houſe alloweth to be let in. 6. Such as do unwarrantably thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry, are ſent, and do come for little good, but much hurt to the flock, let them pretend to what they will; for, <hi>the ſame is a thiefe and a robber,</hi> of which alſo afterward. 7. As faithful paſtours have Gods approbation in their entry; ſo they do acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves faithfully in diſcharge of their truſt; ſo is here held out in ſeveral particulars. His <hi>calling his ſheep by name,</hi> imports his particular inſpection and care of every one of the Lords flock, and his acquaintance with them and their conditions; which though it be eminently verified on Chriſt, yet it is the duty of every faithful paſtour in his meaſure. His <hi>leading them out,</hi> to their paſture, muſt not be ſo ſtrained, as if the Church, which is their fold, were not the place of their feeding alſo, But it imports that faithful paſtours will make it their care, not only to keep the Lords people in ſome external Church-order, as ſheep within a fold, but to feed them alſo with ſound doctrine. <hi>His going before them,</hi> when he putteth them forth, (which is the practice of ſhepherds in ſome Countries) imports not only his going before them by doctrine and good example, but alſo his vigilancy and care about them, and to protect and defend them. 8. The true ſheeps carriage in reference to theſe ſhepherds, doth hold forth ſeveral properties of Chriſts true ſheep. As, 1. They are brought to be ſenſible of their need of direction from God; for, they are guided by <hi>the voyce</hi> of the ſhepherd. 2. They are gifted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning to know the voyce and doctrine of Chriſt, and of his faithful ſervants; for, <hi>they hear and know his voyce,</hi> as ſheep in ſome countries do diſcern the voyce of their own ſhepherds. 3. What directions they get, they do upon all hazards follow; for, as ſheep in ſome countries do follow their ſhepherd upon his call, ſo they <hi>follow him.</hi> 4. They are ſo far enabled to diſcern falſe Teachers and corrupt doctrine, as they do approve of neither; and not only will not obey their doctrine, but will flee from them, that they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nor enſnared with their allurements; for, <hi>a ſtranger they will not follow,</hi> (when he calls them to follow him in a wrong way) <hi>but will flee from him,</hi> (as one they will have nothing to do with all,) and that becauſe <hi>they know not the vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce of ſtrangers,</hi> that is, they do not approve them, though they have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of diſcerning, whereby they know them and their doctrine to be naught. This is aſſerted of Chriſts ſheep, not becauſe they cannot at all erre, nor yet only becauſe it is their duty thus to do, (for that is common to them with reprobates;) but becauſe, 1. When any do either embrace falſe doctrine, or fall in liking with corrupt men, who run unſent, it is no ſigne of their grace, but of their corruption, ſo to do. 2. Whatever dangerous errours a child of God may be overtaken with, yet he will at length recover out of them. And, 3. Whatever may be ſaid of a child of God his living and dying in ſome leſſer errours, in times of ignorance; Yet ſuch as perſiſt in groſſe errours, and particularly in ſeeking another way of ſalvation beſide Chriſt, (which is the firſt and chiefe thing Chriſt points at here in theſe Phariſees) they do prove that they are no ſheep, whatever glorious ſhewes they make.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular in this part of the Chapter, is, the ignorance of the Phariſees, and their not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what Chriſt pointed at by this Parable, which occaſions the following explication. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48148:105"/>
ſometime, to give unto conceited men many evidences of their own weakneſſe, if ſo be they would make uſe thereof, to humble them; As here he gives a ſpeedy proofe that theſe conceited men were indeed blinde. 3. It is a double mercy, when Chriſt not only ſpeaks unto a people, but doth make his minde plain thereby, and doth open their eyes to underſtand it; Therefore is their ignorance marked, to ſhew the mercy of the following explication. And a particular Sermon is made, to point out this priviledge of getting knowledge of Chriſts doctrine and Parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>The third particular in this part of the Chapter; is, the explication of the parable, in ſo far as was needfull, or for Chriſts preſent purpoſe; Which we may take up thus:</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt declares himſelfe to be the doore of the ſheep,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>both in reſpect of paſtours,</hi> ver. 8 <hi>and beleevers,</hi> ver. 9. 2. <hi>He declares him elſe to be the good ſhepherd, in oppoſition to tyranous robbers,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>and to hirelings,</hi> ver. 11, 12, 13. <hi>And in reſpect of his fidelity and care of all his ſheep,</hi> ver. 14, 15, 16. 3. <hi>He obviates the ſcandal that might be taken at that proofe of his fidelity, of laying down his life,</hi> ver. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> Chriſt doth gravely aſſert that he was in effect, to his elect and Saints, what the doore of the ſheepfold is unto ſheep. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is a Teacher who can make his own minde to be underſtood, and when he pleaſeth, he will ſo do, to the converſion, or, at leaſt, the conviction of the hearers; Therefore, ſeeing they underſtood it not, he <hi>ſpake unto them againe,</hi> that he might explaine it. 2: Borrowed ſpeeches and types, are plain enough, if rightly underſtood; and the name of the type may be given to the thing typified, without any tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation of the ſubſtance of the one into the other, but only by reaſon of ſome ſimilitude of properties and effects that is betwixt them; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am the doore,</hi> becauſe he is that unto his children, which a door is unto ſheep entering the fold. 3. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chriſts elect are, of themſelves, and by nature, ſecluded from all acceſſe to God, and from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, in grace here, or glory hereafter; for, that they need a <hi>door,</hi> it imports they are without. 4. It is by Chriſt only that loſt ſinners are admitted to partake of the priviledges and benefits of grace here, or glory hereafter, and who ſo come to him, and employ him on his own tearms, will be admitted; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am the door of the ſheep.</hi>

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> Chriſt clears how he is the doore in reſpect of other paſtours; for clearing whereof, we are not to underſtand that by theſe that <hi>came before him,</hi> are meant the true Prophets, for he ſpeaks of them who <hi>came,</hi> and not of them who were <hi>ſent.</hi> But the ſpeech relates, partly, to them who before that time gave out themſelves to be the Meſſiah, (as ſome, it ſeems, there were, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.36.) And partly, to them who did intrade themſelves into a lawful office, not entering by him, and his warrant, who is the door, and who did not preach him up to be the only door by whom beleevers have acceſſe to God, or did eſtabliſh any religious means and waies of reconciliation to God beſide him. Theſe, and ſuch as they, whether they be before or after Chriſt, in reſpect of time, yet they come before him, in ſo far as they run without his commiſſion, and inſtructions. And though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text ſeeme to referre it, chiefly, to them who were before him in time; Yet theſe are ſufficient characters whereby to try the like perſons, or courſes in all ages. So the meaning is; That whoſoever take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the perſon and office of the Meſſiah, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever do uſurp a lawful calling in the Church without his call, and do not preach the ſound doctrine of Chriſt: they are in effect, and ought to be accounted but murtherers and robbers, and whoever do follow them and their doctrine, yet none of the elect will finally perſiſt in ſuch a courſe; as had been verified in the caſe of former ſeducers. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is the vanity &amp; perverſity of mens hearts, and ſo great, oftimes, is the Lords quarrel againſt the viſible Church; that there will not be wanting in all ages, men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and corrupt judgements, to corrupt the doctrine, and uſurp the moſt eminent Offices appointed for her good; for, there is an <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>who come before him.</hi> 2. However men of old, and of late, have cried up themſelves, and their deviſed doctrines concerning the reconciliation and ſalvation of ſinners; Yet there is no Mediatour but Chriſt, nor any acceſſe to the favour of God ſince the fall of man, but by him; for, all theſe <hi>came before him,</hi> as is explained, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the way. 3. As faithful Teachers of Chriſt are a great bleſſing to the Church; So they who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit corrupt men will not want their own followers, who, for not receiving the love of the truth, are given up to ſtrong deluſions; And albeit not only the unconverted elect, but even regenerate Saints, may for a time be overtaken: Yet none of the elect will be ſuffered to perſiſt finally in following theſe Sect-Maſters, and their corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; for as it was before, <hi>the ſheep did not hear them</hi> (to wit ſo as is expreſſed in the doctrine) ſo it will be ſo ſtill.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt proceeds to declare that, as he is the door, ſo, he is the true ſhepherd. And that firſt (in this <hi>ver</hi>) in oppoſition to theſe whom he called theeves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is, they who give out themſelves to be the Meſſiah, or who run unſent and bring corrupt doctrine. Theſe he declares to be enemies and not ſhepherds, as coming only to do the flock prejudice; But his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand is to give them life, and that in great abundance. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Falſe Teachers and ſeducers will have ſo many faire pretences, and plauſible ſhewes and appearances, that the evill of their way will not be ſoon ſeen; Therefore muſt it be ſo much inculcate, what it is the thiefe comes about. 2. Let ſeducers pretend never ſo faire, and people be never ſo much taken with them; Yet they do really come for the hurt of the flock, and it will prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o, and be ſeen in end; for, <hi>the thiefe comes not, but for to ſteale</hi> &amp;c. that is the whole ſcope of their work. And this mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. Seducers are but thieves, in regard they do but make a prey of men, taking them away from Chriſt, ſtealing away their food that they may give them poyſon and betraying Chriſt of his glory, and them of their happineſſe; and in regard they do all this in a clandeſtine and indirect way; Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The thiefe cometh not, but for to ſteale.</hi> 4. How happy ſo ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ded ſouls may think themſelves, in being made a prey to ſeducers, and in being deluded with their indirect inſinuations; Yet all this tends but to their deſtruction, and to their eternal ruine, if mercy prevent it not; for, as the thiefe cometh to ſteal, ſo alſo <hi>to kill and to deſtroy,</hi> and ſo they are <hi>robbers,</hi> or murthering theeves, as <hi>ver.</hi> 8. 5. Chriſt is a ſhepherd who will be ſo far from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his flock, that he will give life, even to theſe of them who are dead; for, <hi>I am come that they might have life.</hi> 6. Chriſts great ſcope in coming to the world, is, to purchaſe and conferre life upon his own Elect; And whatever his dealing toward them be, yet it tends all to this, and when they finde it otherwiſe, it is their own miſtake: for, ſaith he, <hi>I am come that they might have life.</hi> 7. Chriſt by his coming, not only intends life, but more abundant life to his flock, that is, 1. Albeit he gave life to his people before his comming, yet he hath let it out more abundantly ſince, to ſhew the difference betwixt the Sonne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe now ariſen, and the light that his people had (though from him) before. 2. He will not only give that life that may ſimply ſupply the neceſſity of his people, but ſuch a ſuperabounding meaſure, as may teſtifie his fulneſſe, and may completely refreſh them. 3. Having conferred this abundant life in converſion, he will make it grow more and more while they are within time, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. 4 All this is but a drop, in compariſon of that abundance of life that is reſerved for his people in glory. In theſe reſpects it is ſaid, <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt declareth himſelfe to be the true ſhepherd, in oppoſition to hirelings, who albeit they have a lawful calling, and do not come to kill with falſe doctrine, but do preach truth; yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the diſcharge of their truſt. In this <hi>verſe</hi> Chriſt declareth what he is in oppoſition to theſe; aſſerting that he is that good ſhepherd, who layeth down his life for his ſheep. For underſtanding whereof, it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48148:106"/>
would be conſidered, that taking theſe properties of a ſhepherd ſtrictly, they do properly and only belong to Chriſt, and by them he is diſtinguiſhed not only from hirelings or ſeducers, but from all true Miniſters alſo that are ſent out in his name. But conſidering that he doth approve of lawful ſhepherds under himſelfe, and doth only oppoſe himſelfe here unto hirelings; we may (beſide the conſideration of what is peculiar to him, or requires a peculiar conſideration in him) look to theſe properties as they are taken more largely, and ſo ſome of them do belong alſo to his faithful ſervants in their meaſure and proportion, and by them they are diſtinguiſhed from hirelings and falſe teachers. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Whatever hirelings or ſeducers infeſt the Church, yet the elect want not a ſhepherd; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſt employ ſervants under him, yet he doth not give over the charge of his people, but remains ſtill chiefe ſhepherd and overſeer unto them, to care for them, and furniſh food unto them by his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means; for, in both theſe reſpects, <hi>I am the ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith he. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. 2. Chriſt doth eminently deſerve the title of a good ſhepherd, as being infinite in knowledge, to diſcerne all the neceſſities of his flock, and in pity and wiſdome, to deal tenderly with them, according to their neceſſities; for, <hi>I am that good ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith he. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. 3. Good and faithful ſhepherds do preferre the good of their flock, even to their own life; And as Chriſt not only gives life to his ſheep, but his own life for them, by way of ranſome; ſo his faithful ſervants ſhould not account their life dear, ſo they may fulfil their Miniſtry, and bear teſtimony to the truth: for, it is the character of a true ſhepherd, <hi>the good ſhepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</hi> And Chriſt propounds it in general tearmes, to intimate that though this was eminently and ſingularly true of him, as the Saviour of his people; Yet his ſervants muſt be reſolved to lay down their lives, not to expiate ſinne, but for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Churches faith.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In oppoſition to theſe properties, Chriſt declareth what the hirelings are, who minding only their gain, and having no intereſt in, nor affection to the ſheep, do upon the ſight of any danger from ſeducers or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, deſert their ſtations, and expoſe the flock to danger, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. And from this fleeing, Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that ſuch are hirelings, and care not for the flock, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough that men have an external lawful calling to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and that they be not erroneous; unleſſe alſo they be faithful and ſingle in diſcharge of their truſt; for, beſide theeves and robbers, there is alſo <hi>the hireling,</hi> who is oppoſite unto, and diſapproven by Chriſt, as <hi>not the ſhepherd.</hi> 2. Albeit it be the will of God, that Miniſters and labourers get their wages, and be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; Yet ſuch as make it not the ſcope of their calling, to honour God, and ſeek the good of ſouls, but do minde only, or chiefly, their own game and baſe ends, they do prove themſelves not to be honeſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: for, ſo is imported in his name, <hi>an hireling, and not the ſhepherd.</hi> 3. As the ſheep are all Chriſts own, by reaſon of his purchaſe of them, and dominion over them; So every true paſtour will account Chriſts ſheep as dear to him, as if they were his own, and that becauſe they are Chriſts: And who ſo do not thus reſpect them, they prove themſelves to be but hirelings: for, he is <hi>an hireling, whoſe own the ſheep are not,</hi> not only by way of poſſeſſion, (for ſo they are Chriſts only) but in reſpect of affection, and ſo it is expounded, <hi>verſe</hi> 13, he <hi>careth not for the ſheep.</hi> 4. Albeit it be a ſad enough ſtroak for the Church to be under hirelings, yet Satan is not ſatisfied with that, but, by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, may hound out erroneous Teachers and Perſecutors, to moleſt and vexe her more: for, beſide the hireling, there is <hi>a wolfe</hi> which troubles the ſheepfold: whereby we are to underſtand both falſe Teachers, and Perſecutors, as readily corrupt doctrine is preſſed with violence. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29. 5. Albeit Miniſters in ſome caſes may lawfully flee, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, when the trial and danger is perſonal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Yet when they look more to their own caſe, then to the flocks weal, and when to avoid trouble, they deſert the flock in times of errour and common hazard, they prove themſelves to be but hirelings: for, <hi>he ſeeth the wolfe comming, and leaveth the ſheep, and fleeth.</hi> 6. Men may have more light, and foreſee trials better then others, who yet want courage to abide them; And corrupt men will no longer follow Chriſt and dutie, then they think to compaſſe their own ends by ſo doing; for, <hi>he ſeeth the wolfe comming,</hi> and knoweth he is a wolfe, and yee <hi>he fleeth,</hi> as hoping to attain no more of his baſe ends in that way. 7. When Satan and his inſtruments are let looſe upon a Church, and paſtours do prove unfaithful, there may be great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and deſolation made in it; for, in this caſe, <hi>the wolfe catcheth and ſcattereth all the ſheep.</hi> Some he catcheth by errour, he makes a prey of ſome by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and whoſo eſcape that trial, may yet ſuffer ſcattering, by diviſions, or deprivation of mutual fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and ſolemne aſſemblies. And albeit all this be the wolfes fault, yet it is alſo put upon the hirelings account, who by his example in ſhifting trouble, and by his withholding the encouragement of doctrine, and his want of courage in maintaining truth, doth open a gap to the wolfe, doth expoſe the ſheep as a prey, and doth weaken their hands. 3. Whoever they be that preferre their own commodity and eaſe to the weal of the flock, and do deſert their duty when the flock is in danger, they do prove themſelves to be but mercenary men and hirelings; Therefore is it again repeated, <hi>The hireling fleeth, becauſe he is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt proceedeth yet to clear that he is the good Shepherd, by other properties of a good ſhepherd, which alſo (with the former) do point out the differences betwixt him and falſe teachers and hirelings. In theſe verſes, He declareth himſelfe to be the good Shepherd, and proves it from that familiarity which is betwixt him and his people; He knowing and taking ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of them, and they knowing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. This familiarity and relation is amplified, 1. From a ſimilitude or compariſon, that it reſembles, in part, that mutual knowledge and familiarity that is betwixt the Father and him. 2. From an effect on his part, that his reſpect and affection is ſuch to his ſheep, that he will give his life for them, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The tender relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Chriſt toward his people are worthy to be often ſtudied and meditated upon; and how he makes good theſe relations: Therefore ſaith he over again, <hi>I am the ſhepherd,</hi> and, <hi>the good ſhepherd.</hi> 2. Chriſt hath particular and exact knowledge of all his elect, and who they are that ſhall be ſaved, wherein he will not be diſappointed; for, <hi>I know my ſheep,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in the firſt place, that he hath a knowledge of the individual perſons, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.18. 3. As Chriſt knoweth all his own, ſo he hath a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affection to them, and taketh ſpecial notice and care of them; So that he will not only have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but being converted, his knowledge and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſupply the defect of their prayers, and doth prove that his cures to their particular conditions cannot be miſapplied: So much alſo doth this import, <hi>I know my ſheep,</hi> that is, I affect, and take ſpecial notice of them. 4. Whoever are beloved of Chriſt, as his ſheep, he giveth unto them grace to know and acknowledge and love him; for, it muſt be mutual, though it begin at him, <hi>I know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> 5. There is a mutual knowledge, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence, and affection, betwixt the Father and the Sonne Chriſt, which tends much to the comfort of beleevers in him; for, <hi>the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.24,—30. 6. Albeit the acquieſcence and affection betwixt the Father and the Sonne be matchleſſe and incomprehenſible; Yet the relation and affection betwixt Chriſt and his ſheep cometh neareſt to reſemble it, of any other thing: for, to this purpoſe is this brought in here, that, <hi>As the Father knoweth me, and I</hi> (as the words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal will read) <hi>know the Father;</hi> So, <hi>I know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> And albeit it hold good chiefly on Chriſts part, yet their part is not to be wholly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; who though they come far ſhort to make up the compariſon, yet this is the pattern according to which he will carry them on, ſo far as they are capable, See <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. 7. Chriſts affection is ſo reall and great, that he will give proofe of it by the greateſt effects his people can need, if it were to die, that they may live; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne, <hi>I know my ſheep, as the Father knoweth me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I lay down my life.</hi> 8. Chriſt came into the world, and laid down his life, only for his own elect, whom he knew, and whom he brings in to himſelfe by actual converſion; for, <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> and not the goats.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt proves himſelfe to be the true Shepherd, from another property; Which is, His care to enlarge his Church, by bringing in his own among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: Who albeit they did not belong to the Church of the Jewes, yet he would, in due time, convert and bring them in: And as he is that one Shepherd, ſo he will make up one Church of Jew and Gentile, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall being removed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the malice or oppoſition of wicked paſtours againſt Chriſt; Yet he will have his own elect and Church in the midſt of them: for, here it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had ſheep in <hi>Judea,</hi> notwithſtanding the malice of the Rulers and Phariſees, with whom he will gather <hi>other ſheep,</hi> from among the Gentiles. 2. Chriſt is a Shepherd who not only hath a care of thoſe that are brought in, but he mindeth alſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of his Kingdome; As here we ſee. And herein honeſt Paſtours ſhould imitate him. 3. Albeit Chriſt, in the dayes of his fleſh, was Miniſter of the circumciſion only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. and would neither go himſelfe, not ſuffer his Diſciples to go into the way of the Gentiles; Yet the converſion of the Gentiles, as it was fore-propheſied in the Old Teſtament, ſo it was approven by him, and he purpoſed to have it brought about in due time: So much doth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction teach us. 4. Chriſts own, though as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, are his ſheep, in reſpect of his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bring them in; and his heart is upon them, for that end: for, he calls them <hi>other ſheep,</hi> which <hi>I have,</hi> though they be not yet called, and he ſpeaks of his purpoſe of love concerning them, when they little knew him or it. 5. Chriſts elect ſheep may not only be living in nature, for a time, within the Church; but they may be living without the pale of the Church, to whom he will have the Goſpel ſent, to convert them and bring them in: for, thoſe <hi>other ſheep are not of this fold,</hi> or, no Jewes, nor of that Church which was the only Church at that time; and yet were <hi>ſheep.</hi> 6. Such as are Chriſts ſheep by election and purpoſe, muſt not only be converted, but brought in to the ſociety of the viſible Church, to live under Chriſts care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they muſt <hi>be brought</hi> to the fold. 7. Chriſt himſelfe is chiefe in bringing in his elect, whatever
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48148:107"/>
inſtruments be employed; And he is at pains to ſeek them and gain their conſent, as being bound in the Covenant of Redemption, to preſent all that are given him by Charter, blameleſſe before the Father: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, <hi>I bring them,</hi> and, <hi>I muſt bring them,</hi> the matter not being left arbitrary, even in reſpect of his obligation. 8. Gods purpoſes are ſo unchangable, and Chriſts grace, conferred and applyed to the elect, ſo efficacious and invincible in operation, that he can undertake to prevail with them, to whom he ſo applieth it; for, he undertakes, <hi>they ſhall hear my voyce,</hi> which includes both faith and obedience. 9. All Chriſts converts, in all times and places, will carry the ſame ſtamp, and have the ſame properties agreeable to the Scriptures; for, what was the mark of his ſheep in <hi>Judea.</hi> ver. 3. the ſame is the character of converted Gentiles, <hi>and they ſhall hear my voice.</hi> 10. As all true converts are brought in to the ſociety of the Church; So under the Goſpel, the partition-wall betwixt Jew and Gentile is broken down, and they make up but one Catholick Church: for, <hi>there ſhall be one fold.</hi> 11.

Therefore, in theſe verſes, he cloſeth this diſcourſe with obviating that ſcandal. And, 1. He declareth, that the Father loveth him, becauſe of this his ſuffering; which is not to be underſtood of that love wherewith he is loved as the eternal Sonne of God: but of love to him, and approbation of him, as Mediatour, evidenced in his through-bearing of him in his duty, and his exaltation of him after his ſuffering. 2. He declareth, that he was to lay down his life, not to continue deaths pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but that having payed the ranſome, he might take it again with the Fathers approbation. 3. (Which explains that expreſſion of <hi>laying downe his life</hi>) He declareth, that for the nature of his death, it was not forced upon him, but he yeelded to it by a voluntary diſpenſation, and would prove it was ſo, by his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of himſelfe again out of the bonds of death. 4. He declareth, that he did all this in obedience to a command laid upon him by the Father, and this is the ground of the Fathers love to him, and of his voluntary ſubmiſſion. All theſe, being put together, may take away all juſt ground of ſtumbling at his croſſe. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt, held out with his ignominious croſſe, is the great ſtumbling-block of the world; for, ſo is here imported. 2. Albeit ſhame and ignominy, joyned to the croſſe, do adde to the grievouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Yet all that could not hinder Chriſt to undergo it, for the good of ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and that he might caſt a coppy to his followers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. &amp;c. Yea, he not only bare the croſſe, but had ſo much courage under it, as to commend it as lovely, to them who are ready to ſtumble at it: Therefore, whoever ſtumbled at it, yet not only ſaith he, <hi>I lay down my life,</hi> but he propounds ſuch conſiderations as may make it appear lovely. 3. Chriſt the Mediatour is beloved of the Father, and is he in whom he is well pleaſed, that ſo all who come in under his ſhadow, may be accepted in him; for, ſaith he, <hi>my Father doth love me.</hi> 4. The Father is ſo well pleaſed with the reconciliation of loſt ſinners, that he loveth Chriſt for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking thereof, and is fully ſatisfied with his ſuffering, for attaining that end; In both theſe reſpects it holds good, <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> The Father is pleaſed with him that he undertook that ſervice, and is content with his death as a ſufficient ranſome. 5. Croſſes that ſeem very gloomy, and have much diſpleaſure in them, are yet conſiſtent with the Fathers love toward the ſufferer, eſpecially when they are well borne; So much may we learn from Chriſts experience, who albeit he drank of a verry bitter cup, yet was beloved of the Father. 6. Gods love manifeſted toward any, in their following of his way, is a ſufficient cordial againſt all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it; for, albeit Chriſts ſufferings were bitter, and ſtumbled at by many, yet this ſufficeth him, that <hi>therefore doth my Father love me.</hi> 7. The backſide and iſſue of Chriſt and his followers croſſe, being rightly conſidered, may ſweeten all the rough way that leads to it; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne, as another encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, <hi>I lay down my life, that I may take it againe.</hi> 8. Chriſt having laid down his life for the Redemption of loſt man, did take it again; as a teſtimony that the Father was ſatisfied with his ſufferings; and to be a ground of ſtrong conſolation to beleevers; and, to remove the ſcandal of his ignominious death: for, all theſe are to be found in his <hi>taking his life again.</hi> 9. Chriſt in ſuffering death for ſinners, was not forced to it, nor could enemies have reached him againſt his will; But he did it voluntarily, that ſo he might commend his love to ſinners, and might teach us to act and ſuffer for him willingly, being confident that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can never reach us without our Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29. for, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelfe.</hi> 10. Chriſt, by his reſurrection, gave a proofe how voluntarily he rendred himſelfe unto death; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>I have power</hi> (not only an inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Father, but a liberty at his own pleaſure, as to any thing men could do) <hi>to lay it down and</hi> I <hi>have power to take it againe.</hi> And by this alſo he would prove that he can put a period to the ſufferings of his own, when he pleaſeth, without any help of their crooked wayes. 11. The way of accompliſhment of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was agreed upon betwixt the Father and the Sonne, before the accompliſhment thereof; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>This commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:48148:107"/>
which clears that he came, into the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed how to go about this work. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 6, 7 12. It pleaſed Chriſt to ſuffer death, not only voluntarily, but in a way of ſubjection to his Fathers command, that ſo the merite thereof might every way be full, and acceptable to the Father; for, <hi>this commandment have I received,</hi> He was content to be a ſervant by paction, that ſo his ſuffering might be accepted for his people. 13. A command from God makes ſervice, how ignominious like ſoever, become honourable; and it is our duty in ſuffering times, to fixe our eye on the command and will of God, and on his ſcope and purpoſe in them, and not on the cruelty or malice of inſtruments: for, this is an argument to remove the ſcandal of his croſſe, that he did it in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a command, <hi>This commandment have I received of my Father.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth and laſt particular in this part of the Chapter is, the effects or conſequents of this Sermon among the people; who are again divided in opinion about him, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. Many of them do calumniate him, as one poſſeſſed and mad, and therefore not to be heard, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. and others do maintain that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the late miracle do ſufficiently refute ſuch a calumny, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will not want its own effect or operation among hearers, be what they will; for, here all of them are put to ſome exerciſe about <hi>theſe ſayings.</hi> 2. It is not to be expected that Chriſts doctrine will have alike effects in all; but as it gains ground on ſome, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will harden themſelves the more that they are dealt with: As here we ſee, in theſe different opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him and his doctrine. 3. Chriſts doctrine, meeting with diverſity of diſpoſitions, is ordinarily an occaſion of diviſion or ſchiſme, by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe obſtinacy of ſome in oppoſing the truth, which others muſt maintaine; for, <hi>There was a diviſion</hi> (or, <hi>ſchiſme) therefore, among the Jewes for theſe ſayings.</hi> This is neither to be imputed to the doctrine, nor yet to the maintainers of truth; For it is but mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which oppoſe true doctrine, and the friends of truth ought to reckon, that diviſion is better than agreement in evill. 4. As Chriſts Doctrine ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily findes wicked men as they were, if not worſe; So he marks how often they relapſe in the ſame oppoſition to him and his truth: For theſe cauſes it is marked that <hi>there was a diviſion again,</hi> after the former debates of this kinde, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 43. and 9. 16. to ſhew, that they were ſtill the ſame, and that he marked that it was ſo. 5. When diviſions and ſchiſmes fall forth about Chriſt and his doctrine, it is no ſtrange thing to ſee the moſt part joyne on the wrong ſide of the contraverſie; for, there are <hi>many of them</hi> who calumniate him, and but <hi>others,</hi> or, few only, who take his part. 6. Oppoſers of Chriſt and his truth are ordinarily ſo poſſeſſed with prejudice and malice, that they will not ſo much as hear him, nor can they endure that others ſhould hear him patiently; for, ſay they, <hi>Why hear ye him?</hi> 7. The ſtrongeſt arguments that prejudicate malice hath againſt Chriſt and his truth, are, calumnies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and it, and the carriers thereof; for, this is their argument, <hi>He hath a devil, and</hi> (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the former) <hi>is mad,</hi> and therefore ought not to be heard. 8. Malice is ſo prejudicate and blinded, that no reaſon may be expected from thoſe who are poſſeſſed with it; But they will moſt unjuſtly and obſtinately calumniate, if it were even Chriſt himſelfe; for, albeit he came to deſtroy the works of Satan, and is the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of the Father, yet, ſay they, <hi>He hath a devill, and is mad.</hi> And albeit they had often reproached him with this, <hi>Chap</hi> 7. 20. and 8. 48. and Chriſt had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>efined it, yet they ſtill caſt it up again. 9 Let malice be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo prejudged and violent, yet Chriſt will ſtill get ſome to juſtifie him and his doctrine; for there are others who contradict this. 10. Chriſts doctrine and works are ſufficient to plead for him, and to refute ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, even to their face; for, they put it home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe malicious men, <hi>Theſe are not the words of him that hath a divel: Can a divel open the eyes of the blind?</hi> 11. Such as would own Chriſt, eſpecially in a time of oppoſition, ought to ſtudy his doctrine and works, ſo as the eſteem of his Word in the firſt place; Therefore do they begin at that, <hi>Theſe are not the words of him that hath a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Followeth the ſecond part of the Chapter, wherein is recorded a ſharp conteſt betwixt Chriſt and ſome of the Jewes his enemies. It ſeemeth to have followed not long after the former Sermon, and that Chriſt had ſtayed in and about Jeruſalem, ſince he came up to the feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. till this time in winter: And therefore, <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27. he repeats the doctrine concerning his ſheep, as a thing they had lately heard.

freely if he was the Chriſt, and he giveth them ſuch an anſwer as was convenient.</p>
                  <p>In theſe verſes we have recorded, 1. The time of this debate, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. It was at a <hi>feaſt of dedication,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or conſecrating to God what they had built or repaired for his ſervice. This feaſt was not kept in remembrance of the dedication of the Tabernacle when it was ſet up in the wilderneſſe, of which <hi>Num.</hi> 7.1. &amp;c, For (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that the Tabernacle was now laid by) that dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in the firſt moneth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.2, 17. which anſwereth in part to <hi>March</hi> and in part to <hi>April</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the dedication of the Temple, when it was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> was in the ſeventh moneth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.2. which anſwereth, in part, to <hi>September;</hi> And the dedication of the Temple after the captivity, was in the moneth <hi>Adar, Ezr</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. which anſwereth, in part, to <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> for they kept the paſſeover ſhortly after, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.19. So that this dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was that performed by the Jewes in the time of the Maccabees; who after they had repaired and cleanſed the Temple, and built an Altar, did appoint a feaſt in memorial thereof 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 4.59. and that in winter, or the moneth <hi>Chiſleu,</hi> which anſwereth, in part, to <hi>December.</hi> And they did it in this ſeaſon, becauſe in the Summer they were infeſted with their enemies, that they could not get the work attended. 2. We have recorded, the place where this debate was; to wit, not only in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, verſe</hi> 22. but in <hi>Solomons</hi> porch of the Temple, where Chriſt walked, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. It was the place where the people met, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.3. And albeit that built by <hi>Solomon</hi> was deſtroyed by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> yet the other that was built again, retained the ancient name, ſo alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.11. 3. We have recorded, their firſt queſtion to Chriſt, upon which the contraverſie ariſeth, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. While Chriſt is walking in <hi>Solomons</hi> porch, the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewes encompaſſe him, and challenge him, that by reaſon of his want of freedome in doctrine, they were kept in doubt and ſuſpence: And therefore deſire he would ſpeak out plainly, if he was the Chriſt. This they do, pretending to affect the knowledge of the truth, but in effect, intending to enſnare him, and bring him upon the ſtage as affecting a Kingdome, if he ſhould declare himſelfe to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</p>
                  <p>That this purpoſe may be yet more clear for ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of doctrines, we are to conſider, that much uſe is made of <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23. as a warrant for conſecration, or, dedication of Churches, and for obſervation of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes enjoyned by the Church. And it is alleadged, that Chriſts frequenting of the Temple at that time, is an evidence of his approbation thereof. But to refute this, conſider, 1. Whatever be ſaid of this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in particular; Yet it is certain that a Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tabernacle and Temple was practiced with Gods approbation under the law; and that the moral ſignification thereof (as alſo of dedicating their houſes, and other things) doth ſtand ſtill in force. But the Ceremony it ſelfe is ceaſed, with the ceaſing of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical holineſſe of places and things; and men may as well introduce the reſt of the Jewes ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as this. 2. This feaſt of Dedication, or the yearly remembrance of it in an Aniverſary feaſt of eight dayes, (as the hiſtory hath it) was but an humane invention, in theſe latter and declining times of the Jewes; For, beſide that they had no Prophet to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize this, (1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.46.) as they had, for their other ſacred ſolemnities; It is remarkable that in the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by <hi>Moſes, Solomon,</hi> and thoſe of the captivity, albeit they keept a feſtivity on that day, yet it is no where recorded, that they appointed ſo much as one day, to be yearly obſerved in remembrance thereof: So that this latter practice, in memorial only of renewing the Altar and ſome other decayed things, is rather to be looked on as an evidence of their declining, then as a laudable pattern. 3. The Apoſtles naming of this feaſt, and Chriſts frequenting the Temple at that time, are no evidence of any approbation thereof. For <hi>John</hi> doth mention it in the Hiſtory, only to point out the circumſtance of time ſo as was beſt known to the Jewes; which doth no more import an approbation thereof, than <hi>Lukes</hi> deſcribing the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> travels, by mentioning the Jewiſh feaſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.6. and 27.9. doth import his approbation thereof among Chriſtians. And Chriſt was preſent in the Temple at that time, not to honour that feaſt, or to countenance their humane invention. Nor doth it appear that he was there at this time, that he might take the opportunity of the concurſe of people at that ſolemnity, to publiſh more of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as was his own and his followers ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice at other lawful ſolemnities and meetings of the people. For he was not now te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ching in the Temple, but only walking in <hi>Solomons</hi> porch, when he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the Jewes. Nor yet doth it appear that there was any great concurſe at this feaſt in winter, or, at leaſt, that the people frequented the Temple much at it; But that they ſpent thoſe dayes, rather in carnal mirth, than as holy convocations: (which is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary beſt fruit that ſloweth from mens own Traditions in Religion.) And therefore, Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>walk</hi> in the porch, there being but few, or none, there, till this crowd came about him. So that as the feaſt is named here, only to point out the circumſtance of the time of this debate; So Chriſts walking in the porch is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, only to point out the circumſtance of place, and to ſhew that while Chriſt is walking there, (upon ſome occaſion, into which we need not enquire) they enter upon this debate with him.</p>
                  <p>From the words, thus cleared, we may <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. When a Church hath backſlidden furtheſt, in matter of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and lively and ſpiritual worſhip; then ſhe will be moſt forward to deviſe and obſerve Ceremonies of her own, wherewith to ſerve God: for, it is in this Churches declining time, that they appoint and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a <hi>feaſt of the dedication.</hi> 2. As a Church may, in Gods juſtice, be put to ſuch difficulties, as outward troubles will interrupt their intentions of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So one right uſe of ſuch a diſpenſation, is, when it ſtirs up people to lay hold of all opportunities of any breathing time, to ſet forward the work of God: for, ſo much may be gathered from the time of this feaſt, <hi>it was winter.</hi> Whatever fault was in their courſe, or appointing that feaſt; Yet their repairing of the Temple in winter (becauſe of which they appointed and obſerved the feaſt at that time) intimates how they were moleſted with enemies in the Summer, ſo that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48148:108"/>
they could not attend the work; and how they take the opportunity of a time of breathing in winter, to carry on the work. 3. Chriſt and his ſervants may at all occaſions expect, that Satan and his inſtruments will not be wanting to caſt ſnares and tentations in their way, and to ſeek advantage againſt them; for, when he is <hi>walking in Solomons porch,</hi> he is aſſaulted with tempters, who <hi>came round about him.</hi> But he makes good uſe of this, to bring out precious truths; and <hi>temptations</hi> were a part of <hi>Pauls</hi> Library at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to enable him to preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.19, 20. 4. Chriſts enemies are full of ſubtile policies, and they can turne themſelves into all ſhapes, to draw him (if it were poſſible) in a ſnare; for, ſo doth their practice teach, they pretend great earneſtneſſe to be clear and ſettled in the point, but they had another deſigne. 5. It is a very dangerous condition, for men to live in ſuſpenſe and incertainty about the matters of Religion; and eſpecially, not to be ſettled in knowing and reſting upon Chriſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they in this particular, <hi>How long doſt thou make us to doubt?</hi> (or, <hi>hold us in ſuſpenſe?) if thou be the Chriſt tell us.</hi> Whether they had any real ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in conſcience, though overpowered with malice, or pretended to it only, is not much matter; But they propound it as a very dangerous condition (as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) to be ſo, and ſo much the worſe, the longer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth. The word imports to have the minde, or ſoul, hanging up, as a body in the aire, and ſo to be fleeting, wanting a foundation to reſt on, and this tends to the deſtruction thereof, as the word alſo ſignifieth. 6. Wicked men will not finde the cauſe of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers within themſelves, ſo long as they can alleage any thing without them, (if it were even Chriſt and his Doctrine) to faſten it upon; for, they lay it all to his charge, <hi>Thou makeſt us to doubt,</hi> alleaging that he ſpake not <hi>plainly</hi> what he was; whereas (as Chriſt after cleareth) it was their own blindneſſe, and their darkneſſe contracted through malice, that did hide all this from them. 7. It is a very malicious diſpoſition in men, when they ſeek advantage againſt Chriſt and his ſervants, in their free doctrine; and when they deſire them to ſpeak freely, of purpoſe to bring them in a ſnare: for, ſay they, <hi>If thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly,</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to entrap him.</p>

Whatever be the pretences of men for their unbelief, yet the true cauſe thereof is in themſelves, and not in Chriſt, or in his way of doctrine or diſpenſations; Therefore doth he clear himſelfe, and lay the blame on them. 2. Chriſt word and his works are ſufficient to ground our faith, and confirme it, concerning him, and what he is, Therefore, ſaith he, to clear himſelfe, <hi>I have told you,</hi> and, <hi>the works that I do in my Fathers name,</hi> (as Mediatour, and his Ambaſſadour) <hi>they bear witneſſe of me;</hi> to wit, that I am the Meſſiah.

Whatever ſpecious name men give to their own not cloſing with Chriſt; Yet in effect it is nothing elſe but infidelity, and the fruit of an evil heart of unbelief: Therefore, whereas they ſaid only, they were <hi>in doubt,</hi> or, <hi>ſuſpenſe, ver.</hi> 24.

                  <p>In the ſecond branch of this anſwer, Chriſt points out the true cauſe of their infidelity; Which is, not the obſcurity of his doctrine, but their not being of his ſheep; that is, not as yet converted, and not only ſo, but evidenced to be reprobates, if they continue in that ſinne. And by this he prevents a great objection, and the ſcandal of their not embracing him, who were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in that Church; and ſheweth, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt did not reflect on him, but on themſelves. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Albeit Chriſt will not reveal unto men his eternal purpoſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, till firſt they declare what is in their own hearts; Yet as he knoweth who are elect, and who are reprobates, and as he hath recorded in his Word the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of men that are reprobates, or, at leaſt, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate condition: So he could have wicked men affected and affrighted by ſeeing ſuch evidences in themſelves; Therefore, upon their unbelief, he leads them up to ſee, <hi>ye are not of my ſheep,</hi> that they might

And by this he would tell them that his thoughts of them were ſtill the ſame, and that it was their great ſtupidity, not to take notice of what he had ſo often repeated.</p>

                  <p>In the third branch of the anſwer, Chriſt proves what he had ſaid of them, by ſhewing the contrary properties of his ſheep, which were wanting in them.

Whoever reject Chriſt, yet he will not want his own peculiar people, and their carriage will refute ſuch as pretend to be Gods people, and yet live wickedly; Therefore doth he here again record that he hath <hi>ſheep,</hi> and what their carriage is. 2. It is an undenyable and ſpecial evidence of Chriſts ſheep, that they give up themſelves to his teaching and direction, and do incline their heart and care to take notice of what he ſaith; for, it is repeated, as a ſpecial mark, <hi>my ſheep, hear my voyce.</hi> 3. As Chriſts ſheep hear him, ſo they meet with ſpecial care and providence from him, in that he not only knew them from eternity, by ſpecial purpoſe, and draws them to him, by ſpecial love, but hath an eſpecial eye and care of them; for, <hi>and I know them.</hi> 4.

                  <p>In the laſt branch of the anſwer, leaſt they ſhould account it a ſmall loſſe to be none of his ſheep; Chriſt, to grieve them who would not embrace him, lets them ſee the fair priviledges and allowance which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerreth upon his ſheep. And, 1. He aſſures them of eternal life, and of perſeverance, till they come to the full fruition thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.—2. He confirmes this, from his own and his Fathers power, which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about them, for their preſervation, and which is above all oppoſition, <hi>ver.</hi>—28, 29. 3. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes further wherefore he had joyned his own power with the Fathers in this work, by ſhewing, that he and the Father are one in eſſence, and conſequently have the ſame power and will. And therefore as none can pluck them out of the Fathers hand, ſo none can pluck them out of his hand, who is one with the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such as come not to Chriſt, are great loſers, and the happy condition of theſe who would not follow them, will be their eye-ſore one day; Therefore doth Chriſt preach to them the fair priviledges of his people, to let them ſee how far they prejudged themſelves, and to vexe them. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.10. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.10. 2. All who come to Chriſt indeed, get eternal life begun in them, in the bud of grace, and in their right by faith; for, <hi>I give</hi> (ſaith he, in the preſent time) <hi>unto them eternal life.</hi> See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29, 30. 3. This great priviledge is Chriſts gift, being both purchaſed and applyed by him; for, <hi>I give unto them eternal life.</hi> 4. Albeit Chriſts converted people may have many ſhakings and toſſings in their condition; Yet their final perſeverance, till they come to full poſſeſſion of eternal life, is certain: ſo that whatever they loſe by the way, yet they will not loſe themſelves eternally: Therefore he who <hi>giveth eternal life,</hi> doth alſo promiſe, <hi>and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> 5. When Chriſt conferres his ſpecial favours and allowances on his ſheep, he doth alſo take a charge of them and their allowances, and hath a ſpecial care of them; for, ſo is imported here, the ſheep, to whom eternal life is given, are in <hi>my hand,</hi> ſaith he. The forme of ſpeech, to <hi>be in his hand,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not only that they are under his power, to do with them what he will, ſo that nothing is to be feared if he deſert them not; But more eſpecially, it points out, that they are ſtill in his ſight and under his care, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he teſtifieth his affection, and prevents any prejudice to them. 6. Such as are owned by Chriſt as his ſheep, and ſo are put in a bleſſed condition, will not want ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to oppoſe them, and to endevour to bring them down from their happineſſe; for, it is ſuppoſed here, that there will be ſomewhat (to wit, Satan, the world, and their own fleſh) to endevour to <hi>pluck them out of his hand.</hi> 7. Albeit the Lord do conferre grace and faith upon his own, yet that is not ſufficient to ſecure them; but theſe might decay of themſelves, if it were not for the purpoſe of God in conferring thereof, and his power and everlaſting armes, preſerving the ſame; Therefore it is that, for ſecuring of them, they need to be in <hi>his hand.</hi> 8. Chriſt is ſo unchangable in his purpoſes of love, and ſo invincible in his power, that nothing ſhall be able to hinder their perſeverance unto eternal life, whom he takes in his cuſtody and charge; Therefore doth he confirme their perſeverance thus,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48148:110"/>
                     <hi>Neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hands.</hi> As for theſe who grant that, indeed none can pluck them out, unleſſe they go out willingly of themſelves; they do clearly impugne Chriſts reaſoning, who upon this, that none ſhall pluck them out of his hand, doth inferre, that they <hi>ſhall never periſh,</hi> whereas granting that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, it might be ſaid, they may periſh of their own accord, though they be not plucked out, But Chriſt, by this promiſe, doth give aſſurance of their certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is an argument of the Saints perſeverance, and of Chriſts employing his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for that end, that they are committed to him by the Father to be forth-coming for them; Therefore doth he declare in this matter, <hi>My Father gave them me.</hi> 2. The Father doth ſo intruſt Chriſt with his ſheep, as yet he caſts not off care of them; But as Chriſt is engaged for them, as the Fathers ſervant and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner: ſo the Father is engaged to make them forth-coming to Chriſt, as the covenanted reward of his ſufferings: And ſo the immutable Father and Sonne, and their invincible power, is employed for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; Therefore alſo they are in <hi>the Fathers hand,</hi> as well as Chriſts. 3. The power of God is ſo invincible, and ſo far above all created oppoſition; and he doth ſo let out his power, in maintaining Saints in the ſtate of grace, as doth ſufficiently aſſure them of the certainty of their perſeverance; for, ſo doth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument run, <hi>My Father is greater then all,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> And here they who except mans freewill in this point, alleaging they may go out of his hand, they do wrong both the power of God, by implying that the idol of mans will muſt be exempt from his dominion, as if he could not command it; and his fidelity, who hath promiſed to ſubdue the will to his fear, that Saints may perſevere, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 30. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts working in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of his ſheep doth demonſtrate his greatneſſe, and prove him to be God; Therefore doth he here point out his preſerving them, with the Father, as flowing from, and being an evidence of his eternal Godhead. 2. Chriſt is ſo God, as he is one in eſſence and nature with the Father; for, ſaith he, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſt be one in eſſence with the Father, yet are they diſtinct perſons one from another; for, albeit they be <hi>one,</hi> yet there is <hi>I and my Father,</hi> and a plurality of perſons, <hi>we are one.</hi> 4. Becauſe the Sonne is one in eſſence with the Father, therefore are they equal in power, and with one conſent and will are employed about the ſame work; for, upon this ground, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> it followeth, that they are both about this work of preſerving the ſheep, and that his power is ſufficient to preſerve them, becauſe the Father, with whom he is one, is greater then all.</p>

                  <p>From this to <hi>verſe</hi> 39. We have a ſecond encounter betwixt Chriſt and the Jewes, following upon the former.

                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have the carriage of the Jewes upon the former anſwer given to them: They, not finding that advantage they expected, whereupon they might have delated him to the <hi>Romans;</hi> do take hold (as they clear afterward) of a pretext of the law againſt blaſphemy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.14, 16. to condemne his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and thereupon do tumultuouſly take up ſtones to put him to death. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences perſecutors have of a deſire of plain doctrine, yet they will not get their malice hid, but will at laſt bewray that they cannot endure what they ſeem to deſire; for, they who were ſo earneſt (<hi>ver.</hi> 24.) to hear Chriſt ſpeak out, are now enraged, when he doth ſpeak. 2. Violence and fury are the ſtrongeſt weapons of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and it is that only that may be expected of them, when Chriſt and his ſervants preach that which doth not pleaſe them; for upon hearing of the former doctrine, they are ſo abrupt, as preſently they <hi>take up ſtones to ſtone him,</hi> and that without ſo much as telling the cauſe or pretence, till afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. that Chriſt draw it out of them. In all which we may ſee how far the fury of men, in oppoſing truth doth outſtrip the true zeal of the godly for truth. 3. As perſecutors are inceſſant in their rage, upon all new occaſions; ſo the Lord marks that it is ſo, and how often men do let looſe their fury againſt his Sonne and ſervants; Therefore it is recorded that they <hi>took up ſtones again,</hi> after they had done ſo before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 59. and at other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>

Times of trial and perſecution will put men to make enquity, and to ſearch what may be in them, drawing on ſuch a lot; for, ſo much doth Chriſts practice teach, who by his commending all that he had done to them, doth inſinuate a looking back to what it was he had done. 2. Let men never ſo oft

pick a quarrel againſt Chriſt, yet as in the dayes of his fleſh, he ſuffered nothing for any fault he had done; ſo men ſhall never be able to inſtruct any evil he hath done, wherefore he ſhould be hated or perſecuted; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>for which works, ſhewed from my Father, do ye ſtone me?</hi> Importing they could have no quarrel againſt him, unleſſe they would quarrel a good turn. 3. It is Chriſt; way with his people and viſible Church, to work gloriouſly for them; to multiply theſe his glorious works; and, by his working, to ſet out his own and his Fathers glory, and give evidence of their good will toward loſt ſinners: And all this he doth, to gain upon their affections: for, ſo much is imported in what he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father,</hi> (manifeſting his glorious power, and rich good will, by working theſe in his name) becauſe of which he reckons they ſhould rather embrace, then ſtone him. 4.

Such is the perverſity of men, even within the viſible Church, that having occaſion and a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they may come to that height of impietie, as to blaſpheme God; And where men do ſo, they are guilty of death; for, ſo much doth the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they pretend to obey here, import, both that ſome within <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ready to fall in that ſinne, and that ſuch ought to be ſtoned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies the hurting of ones fame, and being applyed to God, imports the wounding and depriving him of his honour and glory, which (omitting raſh and idle ſwearing) is committed, when men deny unto God what is due unto him; when they attribute unto him that which doth not beſeeme him; when they aſcribe unto man that which is due only unto God; and, when they curſe and raile, or reproach God, his Word, and works. And for preventing hereof, men ſhould avoid unbelief and diſtruſt, pride and ſelfe-love, and murmuring under diſpenſations. 4. Such corruption may creep into a viſible Church, as even Chriſt may be accounted a blaſphemer, and his moſt precious truths condemned as blaſphemy; for, ſo it was here, <hi>we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, and</hi> (which explains and ſpecifies what they accounted blaſphemy) <hi>becauſe that thou, being a man, makeſt thy ſelfe God.</hi> Where they do indeed underſtand Chriſt rightly, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to be true God, equal with the Father, nor doth he contradict this, but confirme it in the following anſwer; Only they wrong him, in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it blaſphemy. For albeit it be indeed blaſphemy to aſſert that any meer man is God, in proper tearmes, (though in ſome reſpect ſome men do bear that name, <hi>ver.</hi> 34.) yet he had abundantly cleared before, that as he was true man, ſo he was true God alſo in the ſame perſon.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt by two arguments vindicates himſelfe from the imputation of blaſphemy, in aſſerting himſelfe to be God. The firſt (in theſe verſes) is founded on that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. Wherein, 1. He doth in general prove, that it is not blaſphemy to call a man
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48148:111"/>
god in ſome reſpects, ſeeing Magiſtrates get that name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 2. He argues upon this ground, not barely that he may call himſelfe God, in the ſame ſenſe that they get that name; But from the leſſe to the more, thus: If they be called gods who are in that office, much more may I, who am ſeparate to an higher em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, be called ſo, without blaſphemy. But the Scripture, which cannot be broken, hath called them ſo. Therefore I may be called ſo. And this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he propounds by way of queſtion, to ſhew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of their aſſertion, his reaſon being conſidered, and that their conſciences could not decline this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For clearing the words, and this reaſoning, Conſider, 1. The ground on which Magiſtrates are called <hi>gods (to whom the word of God came,)</hi> may be underſtood of their calling to the office, as it's ſaid of Prophets, <hi>The word of the Lord came to them:</hi> and ſo ſeveral Magiſtrates of the Jewes got their office by the Miniſtry of Gods ſervants, bringing that office and call to them. Not that a call, ordinary or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to every office, inferrs that title; but only a calling to that office of power and authority. It may as well be underſtood, that <hi>the word came to</hi> them, not ſo much in reſpect of their calling, as that in that ſame Scripture cited, God calls them ſo, and ſo it is an expoſition of that word in the Pſalme, <hi>I ſaid, ye are Gods,</hi> that is, the Word came to them, and God ſpeaking in it, gave them that title; Thus the Argument will run ſtrong enough, 1. Since the Word came to them, and ſpake to them under that name, it cannot be blaſphemy to call men gods, as the Jewes alleaged. 2. If they, who, being on earth, are ſpoken to, and commanded, and reproved by the Word, get that title (as is clear from that Pſalme) much more is it due to him, who being from eternity with the Father in heaven, and not in the world, did ſtoop to come into it, to perfect the work of redemption. Conſider, 2. As for the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt argues, that without blaſphemy he may be called the Sonne of God, (that <hi>the Father hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, and ſent him into the world</hi>). We need not underſtand this <hi>ſanctification</hi> only, or ſo much, of the ſanctification and cleanſing of his humane nature from ſinne, as of the aſſumption of his humane nature into the perſonal union, and of his conſecration from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto the office of Mediatour; upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his actual ſending into the world, in the fulneſſe of time. And albeit Chriſt, in this firſt argument, ſeems rather to refute the imputation of blaſphemy, then directly to prove how he is God, which he doth in the following argument: Yet there is much inſinuate here that evinceth it; As, 1. He ſets himſelfe ſo far above Magiſtrates who get that ſtile, as doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre he is God in a proper ſenſe. 2. The office of Mediatour, in which he is employed, is ſuch, as albeit his ſanctification, and ſending into the world, about it, do not make him God; Yet it doth evidence and give us to know that he is God, ſeeing none but <hi>Jehovah</hi> could bear out in that office. Nor doth the Fathers <hi>ſending</hi> of him, import any inequality, ſeeing an equal may ſend an equal with conſent, yea an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a ſuperiour. 3. He who is firſt <hi>ſanctified,</hi> before he be <hi>ſent into the world,</hi> did certainly ſubſiſt, and was, before his incarnation and coming into the world. 4. It was no ſmall part of his ſanctification and ſitting for his office, that his humane nature was aſſumed into a perſonal union with his Godhead, and this ſeems to be imported in his ſanctification by <hi>the Father,</hi> and that he calls himſelfe not <hi>God,</hi> as Magiſtrates were, but <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> to ſhew not only, that he is not God as ſecluding the Father, but by eternal generation from the Father; But alſo, that this ſanctification by the Father, upon which he gathers this, doth relate to the elevation of the humane nature into a perſonal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Sonne of God, as well as to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>From theſe verſes, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The written Word is the Judge and Rule whereby all contraverſies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt be decided; Therefore doth Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to it, <hi>is it not written?</hi> 2. Whoever be againſt Chriſt, or whatever skill or intereſt they pretend in Scriptures; Yet the Scriptures will be ſtill on his ſide; Therefore doth he appeal to themſelves, if the Scriptures, whereof they boaſted, did not clear him of blaſphemy, <hi>Is it not written in your La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>?</hi> 3. The Scriptures are a great deep, and full of treaſures, to be gathered by ſpiritual and ſober obſervers; Therefore doth Chriſt ſo ſolidly and profoundly reaſon from that text, to his preſent purpoſe. 4. Whatever be the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects of holy Scripture, yet all of it is a Law, in ſo far as men are obliged to rule their converſation, affections, faith, hope, and fear, thereby; Therefore, albeit elſewhere the Old Teſtament be diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>Law, Prophets, and Pſalmes,</hi> Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet here the Pſalmes, whence this text is cited, come under the name of <hi>Law.</hi> And it may be alſo, becauſe the word in the Hebrew language, (wherein, or in Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake, a dialect of Hebrew, Chriſt ſpake) rendred <hi>the Law,</hi> ſignifies generally, <hi>a doctrine.</hi> 5. As it is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priviledge, to have the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Albeit Magiſtrates be but men like their brethren; Yet in reſpect of their office, they have the glorious title of gods conferred upon them, as being his vicegerents, and as bearing ſome ſtamp of his authority and dominion: Therefore, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>I ſaid ye are gods.</hi> This ſhould both engage them to ſee to their qualifications and the exerciſe of their power; and others, to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour them. 8. Such as would have right to this glorious title, and the priviledges contained therein, ought to have Gods calling to the office they exerce; for, <hi>he called them gods, to whom the Word of God came,</hi> to call them to their employment. 9. Let Magiſtrates be never ſo high, yee are they ſubject to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48148:112"/>
God, and to the directions and injunctions of his word; for, ſo alſo <hi>the word came</hi> to them, as to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as appears in that Pſalme. 10. Things are in reality as the Word of God calls them, whatever men imagine to the contrary; for, if <hi>the word came to them,</hi> and <hi>he called them Gods,</hi>—that ſentence muſt ſtand without empeachment of blaſphemy. 11. Albeit men, who do not reject the Scripture, will be very aſſiduous to wreſt and throw it to countenance their opinions and wayes, and to bring their light to it, rather then ſeek light in it; Yet its verdict doth ſtand unalterable; for, <hi>the Scripture cannot be broken,</hi> or <hi>looſed;</hi> that ſentence, that they are gods, cannot be anulled, let men cavil or gloſſe it as they will. 12. Chriſt is ſo high above all principalities and powers, as of neceſſity he muſt be, true God; for, ſo do the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment run, that if they were called gods, much more might he be called <hi>the Sonne of God.</hi> And therefore all the gods muſt worſhip him, even Angels as well as Magiſtrates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. 13. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſtudy Chriſts glorious ſanctification and ſeparation from ſinners, his glorious endowments, and high employment and office, muſt acknowledge that he is the eternal Sonne of God: for, that <hi>the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent him into the world,</hi> doth inferre that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt did ſo far condeſcend to cure the unbeliefe of men, as to ad glorious works to his Word to declare who he is; for, he hath <hi>the works of the Father</hi> pleading for him; That is, not only works done by the Fathers authority, for ſo his ſervants did work miracles, but works done by that power which is common to him with the Father. 2. Albeit it be our duty to acknowledge and to beleeve in Chriſt, yet he requires no implicite and blinde obedience in this point; But men ſhould accuratly try the grounds of their faith, and then, on theſe grounds cloſe with him; Therefore doth he put them to this, <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, beleeve me not,</hi> and afterward, <hi>that ye may know and beleeve.</hi> 3. Chriſts works were divine, even to the convincing of the greateſt adverſaries; and ſo clear, that Chriſt was content not to be beleeved, if, after trial, their conſciences did not finde them to be ſo: Therefore he doth not decline them in this matter, but <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, beleeve me not.</hi> 4. When Chriſt hath manifeſted never ſo much of himſelfe; Yet naturally men have prejudices againſt him, and at beleeving in him; Therefore, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it, as their fault, <hi>ye beleeve not me.</hi> 5. Albeit Chriſt get much wrong by unjuſt prejudices of men, yet he doth not give over to minde and ſeek their good; Therefore, albeit they beleeved not him, yet he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with other means, to draw them to beleeve, and warnes them of their own ſinne, if they did not; <hi>Though ye beleeve not me, beleeve the works, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Albeit it be our duty to reſt content with Gods Word, as the ground of our faith, not ſeeking any other proofe; And albeit it be our great ſinne when it is not ſo; Yet when he ads works to confirme his Word, he may not only exact beleeving of us, but it is our ſinne undeniable, if then we beleeve not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, <hi>If I do, though ye beleeve not me, beleeve the works.</hi> 7. Chriſt is never rightly known and beleeved on, but when he is taken up as one in eſſence with the Father; And that however the perſon of the Sonne be diſtinct from the perſon of the Father, in reſpect of order of ſubſiſtence, properties, and order of working; yet the divine eſſence is undivided, and there is a mutual inexiſtence of one perſon in the other; for, they muſt <hi>know and beleeve that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>

From his name <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the ſame, as appears, with, <hi>Eleazar.</hi> 2. From his condition, he <hi>was ſick,</hi> or <hi>infirme,</hi> as the Word imports. 3. From the place of his habitation, and friends; He was of <hi>Bethany,</hi> a village near to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ver. 18. and <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> (of whom <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.38, 39) were his ſiſters, as afterward appears. This village is called <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha's</hi> town, becauſe they were born there, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.44. or, becauſe indeed it was <hi>Lazarus</hi> and their property, and ſo they are afterward viſited by them of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of reſpect; and the ſiſters get the name of it, becauſe they have been ſpoken of before, <hi>Luk</hi> 10.38. and ſo are better known in this hiſtory, then <hi>Lazarus</hi> yet was. Or, the reaſon of this deſignation is, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whoever was Maſter of this village, yet they are moſt eminent of any in it, in Chriſts account, they being godly, and he having been entertained there. 4.

Chriſtian friends, eſpecially if they be alſo near in relation, are uſeful helps in a day of trial; Therefore is mention made of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> upon occaſion of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſickneſſe, becauſe they were uſeful and eminent in the following paſſages, relating to their brothers recovery.

The Lord will not ſuffer mens actions to die with them; and particularly, A good turn done to Chriſt, will not be forgotten of him; Therefore, according to that promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. that this ſhould be told of her, <hi>John</hi> doth here, on this occaſion, record it. 2. Love to Chriſt is that which God takes eſpecial notice of, and which doth commend them who have it; for, it was an act of <hi>Maries</hi> love, which is ſo diligently recorded. 3. It is the will of God, that poſterity take notice of the eminent graces that have ſhined in Saints, that they may imitate them; for, this is recorded not only to her commendation, but that Chriſts commending it, and the ſavour thereof, may invite others to imitate her.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſt be looked on, oft-times, as very troubleſome company, and therefore men do drive him away, either from themſelves, by ill entertainment, or from the places they live in, by perſecution; Yet it will be found, that he may very ill be wanted in any place; for, albeit Chriſt was driven away by the Jewes fury, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 39, 40. Yet he is now miſſed and needed in <hi>Judea</hi> 2. Albeit the bonds of nature will not alwayes tye friends one to another; yet true piety will make the ſociety of ſuch comfortable, and make them truely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one to another in ſtraits; for, here <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his ſiſters dwell together, and they bear a great weight in this his affliction, employing all means for his good, and being afterward heavily afflicted, when they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not according to their deſire. 3. As Chriſt hath taken on man; nature, ſo he hath alſo <hi>contracted</hi> a friendſhip betwixt himſelfe and ſome loſt ſinners; And as he reſpects all his creatures, as he is God and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, his parents, kinred, nation, friends, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in their ſeveral relations, as he is man; and loves all his elect, as he is Mediatour: So it hath pleaſed him alſo, as a good man, to bear eſpecial love to ſome of his own elect, as a man doth to his eſpecial friends; Therefore is <hi>Lazarus</hi> deſcribed here to be, <hi>he whom thou loveſt,</hi> which doth not ſeclude his love to him in moſt of the former reſpects, but yet eſpecially points at that eſpecial love to him as a ſingularly good man. So alſo did he love the beloved diſciple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.23. 4, Whatever may be the expectations of men upon

Chriſts love to them yet it will not exempt them from outward calamities; for, albeit they might think it ſtrange, that <hi>he whom thou loveſt is ſick,</hi> yet both of theſe are conſiſtent, and may ſtand together. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mens ſtraits be, bodily or ſpiritual, great or ſmall, or whatever lawful means they employ when they are under them; Yet then are difficulties rightly taken up, when men look upon them as needing and calling for Chriſt; and when, accordingly, the afflicted and their friends alſo do recommend the trial to him; for, ſuch is their carriage, they finde a need of Chriſt, for help under this bodily and outward trial, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>ſent unto him.</hi> 6. In coming to Chriſt, and employing of him under difficulties, no impediment that may deterre us, ought to be regarded; for, albeit in ſending this meſſage, it might be <hi>ſuggeſted,</hi> That, poſſibly, he had more to do, and might do more good where he was; That being far off, he could not come in time; and, That it was not ſafe to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the fury of the Jewes; Yet they being in need, paſſe over all theſe, and <hi>ſent unto him.</hi> 7. Albeit Chriſt may make uſe of a trial, to beget friendſhip betwixt him and ſome of his elect; Yet they have a great advantage, who have it made up before; for, this is the ground of their confidence, that Chriſt loved <hi>Lazarus</hi> before, <hi>He whom thou loveſt, is ſick.</hi> And therefore, if ever men think they will ſtand in need of Chriſt, they ſhould make acquaintance with him in time. 8. Whatever there may be on Saints part, that would ſeem to commend them to Chriſt; yet true Saints will renounce all that, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to his free love toward them; for, ſo much doth their practice teach, They do not deſcribe <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> as their brother, as if they would boaſt of any credite with Chriſt by their worth; nor do they mention any love in <hi>Lazarus</hi> entertaining Chriſts love, but they betake themſelves only to this, it is <hi>he whom thou loveſt.</hi> 9. Such as do beleeve Chriſts love toward them, ought alſo to beleeve that even their bodily infirmities are reſpected by him, and will be an acceptable errand to come to him withall; for, they do confidently employ him in this, <hi>Behold, he is ſick.</hi> 10. Where Chriſts love is beleeved, it will be accounted enough to lay our caſe before him, without preſcribing the way of help to him; Therefore, do they content themſelves with this petition, <hi>Behold, be whom thou loveſt is ſick,</hi> and they ſay no more. As Saints can never have peace in any condition, till they tell Chriſt of it; So they know their needs not much be ſaid to a Father, in limiting him to their deſires; but when they have laid their caſe before him to be conſidered, they may commit the anſwer to his wiſdome and love.</p>

In this verſe we have his ſpeech, directed chiefly (as would appear) to the meſſenger, to carry back to <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> for their encouragement; Wherein he declareth, that this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe tended not to <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, but to the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glory of God, in the glorifying of his Sonne. While he ſets down the end of this ſickneſſe negatively, that it <hi>is not unto death,</hi> albeit he did dye; It is not ſufficient to clear it thus, that it tended not to bring <hi>Lazarus</hi> to eternal death; For, albeit that be a great comfort, yet it is not chiefly intended here, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what is after poſitively ſet down of Gods purpoſe in this ſickneſſe; But the meaning is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſhould die, yet not irrevocably, and ſo as he ſhould not be reſtored to live, even here again, as they underſtood his death, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. And thus alſo, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.39. he denyeth that a damſel is dead, but affirmeth that ſhe ſleepeth, becauſe he was to raiſe her as out of a ſleep. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 1.

                     </gap> there is never an encouraging word given, but a tentation will be let out after it, to try our faith about it) Yet he would have, them ſtick by this, and would have them look on ſweet looks and good words from Chriſt, as more then halfe health in the midſt of ſoreſt trouble. 2 It is an encouragement to Chriſts own in trouble, that he is a skilful Phyſitian, who takes up their diſeaſe rightly, and what it tends to; So that they ſhall not periſh through want of skill, or wrong application of cures; Therefore, in the firſt place, he tells them that he knows the diſeaſe, what it is, and what it tends to, <hi>This ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not unto death,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is Chriſts allowance that his people, in looking on their troubles, do not judge of them by the firſt view, nor by their neareſt end (for ſo the end of this ſickneſſe was death:) Nor yet by what of their own nature they portend, and tend unto, (for in that reſpect alſo, this ſickneſſe was unto death:) But that they look to Gods furtheſt and moſt principal end in them, and to what God (who brings light out of darkneſſe, meat out of the eater, and life out of death) can bring out of them; for, it is in this reſpect that God would have them, for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing that <hi>this ſickneſſe is not unto death,</hi> as is before explained. 4. As Gods own glory is his ſupreme end in all things; ſo in particular, his ſcope in ſending afflictions on his people, is to make his glory conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in their through-bearing under them, and in giving an iſſue from them; for, ſaith he, <hi>this ſickneſs is for the glory of God.</hi> And albeit God do not manifeſt his glory in ſo extraordinary a way, when his people are in trouble, as he did on <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s behalfe, yet the general holds ſtill true, that he will be glorified in all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of his people. 5. The Lords purpoſe to glorifie himſelfe on behalfe of his people, requires that they be exerciſed with ſickneſſe and other infirmities, that ſo he may magnifie his power, wiſdome, mercy, and love, toward and upon them; for, there muſt be <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> that <hi>the glory of God</hi> may ſhine. 6. Were afflictions never ſo bitter and ſo grievous, yet this ought to ſweeten them, if God take occaſion thereby to honour himſelfe;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48148:114"/>
for, this is an encouragement to ſweeten the cup, and make them ſubmit, that <hi>this ſickneſſe is for the glory of God.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27, 28. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. 7. God is glorified, in that his Sonne Chriſt is glorified; and his glory in helping his people under trouble, ſhines, in proving Chriſt to be omnipotent and true God equal with the Father, in giving deliverance to them; for, he clears, that it is <hi>for the glory of God,</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>that the Sonne of God may be glorified thereby.</hi> So that as none do honour the Father, who do not honour the Sonne, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5, 23. So it may encourage Saints, that the Father accounts Chriſts glorifying of himſelfe on their behalfe, to be for his glory.</p>

Yet when he heard of his ſickneſſe, he ſtayed ſtill two dayes before he motioned his returne to <hi>Judea, ver.</hi> 6, This he did, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead before he came, the two ſiſters might be the more fully tried, and his own glory might ſhine the brighter, for ſtrengthening the faith of his people, as will be ſeen in the ſequel of the hiſtory, particularly, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As God hath ſet his love on ſinful duſt, and Chriſt man hath by his own practice ſanctified holy friendſhip; So mens pretending and ſaying they are beloved of Chriſt, is to little purpoſe, unleſſe Chriſt ſay ſo alſo; Therefore is it confirmed here, what they had expreſſed concerning <hi>Lazarus.</hi> 2. Such as, upon Goſpel tearms and grounds, do lay claime to Chriſts love, will not be repelled nor diſappointed; for, they ſay, it is <hi>he whom thou loveſt,</hi> and here, <hi>Amen</hi> is ſaid to their claime, <hi>Jeſus loved Lazarus.</hi> 3. It is a great mercy to be beloved of Chriſt, but it is a double mercy, when the Lord lets out his love on a whole ſociety and children of a family together; Therefore it is added, <hi>Jeſus loved Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus,</hi> which might be a comfort to every one of them, in reſpect of the reſt. 4. Saints ſobriety, in eſteeming of themſelves, and in preferring others to themſelves, will never looſe them any thing in Chriſts eſtimation; Therefore, albeit they mention only <hi>Lazarus</hi> as beloved of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. yet here themſelves alſo are added. Unbeliefe is indeed no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, nor yet is it ſobriety in Saints, to ſhut out themſelves from any part in Chriſts love; Yet when men have laid hold on him, it becomes them to preferre others, and make more noiſe of them, then of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 5. Albeit there may be much difference of growth among Saints, &amp; ſome may have moe blemiſhes then others; Yet Chriſt doth love true grace in any of his, how weak ſo ever; Therefore, albeit <hi>Martha</hi> was more wordly then <hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 10.39, 40, 41, 42. and it appears afterward ſhe was not ſo broken ſpirited as ſhe, yet <hi>Jeſus loved Martha,</hi> as well as <hi>Mary.</hi> 6. Chriſt requires that his peoples heart be guarded againſt any miſconſtruction of his dealing, by the faith of his love and ſeeing love in all of it; Therefore is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, of his love to them, to prevent any miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his ſtay till <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould dye. 7. There is no outward croſſe-diſpenſation, nor apparently harſh dealing, but it is conſiſtent with love, and may ſlow from love to his own; And particularly, Chriſt may dearly love his own, and yet may delay to help them, even in their extremity, till a fit time come, wherein his glory may ſhine, and the mercy be more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Therefore upon this, that <hi>Jeſus loved them</hi> it followeth, <hi>When he had heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two dayes ſtill in the ſame place where he was.</hi>

As oft-times ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and on-lookers are more terrified with the croſſe, then ſufferers themſelves; So in particular, Chriſt did endure the croſſe, and make for it, with ſuch reſolution, as aſtoniſhed his followers; for, he invites them to go into <hi>Judea,</hi> when they wonder he ſhould go <hi>thither again.</hi> 2.

The arguments of the wiſdome of the fleſh, and of carnal fear, are but invalide to ſatisfie the conſcience. Hazards, either real or apparent, are ſtrong motives to diſſwade our carnal hearts from duty, but theſe are no ſound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in divinity; for, they think it a ſtrong argument, <hi>The Jewes of late ſought to ſtone thee,</hi> and therefore <hi>goeſt thou thither again?</hi> But Chriſt counts not that ſound, that men ſhould chooſe their way, according to their apprehenſion of dangers or ſafety in it, but according as God clears a calling, whatever difficultie be in the way; As reckoning that many difficulties will tryſt men with many proofes of love; and that, as they but <hi>ſought to ſtone</hi> Chriſt, and yet could not effectuate it. So, the Lord can give ſafety, even in the midſt of dangers, when he pleaſeth. 6. It is the great ſinne of men poſſeſſed with the ſlaviſh fear of trouble, that not only they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline duty, but are ſelviſh, ſo that they minde neither the honour of God, nor the good of others, ſo they may keep themſelves in ſafety; for, ſo much appears in their declining <hi>Judea</hi> to be free of trouble, never regarding <hi>Lazarus</hi> or his ſiſters need, nor the glory of God, which was to ſhine in raiſing him up.</p>

                     </gap>ay, we conſider theſe, we will finde the ſenſe of this general anſwer to be this; That a calling from God is like day-light to a man, to prevent fear of ſtumbling, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency and danger: whereas he who neglects the opportunity thereof, may fall in many inconveniences, like a man who neglects his journey till the evening or night, and therefore cannot chooſe but ſtumble, ſeeing he wants the light of day, and hath no light in him to ſupply that defect. And by this, Chriſt leads them to underſtand, that as he had a calling to leave <hi>Judea,</hi> ſo if he could clear a calling to return to it again, there was no danger, whereas to ſleight a calling would draw on real inconveniences <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The great task and exerciſe of Chriſtians ought to be, to turn their eyes from ſtudying inconveniencies and hazards, to ſtudy their duty and calling, as their work and care, and then leave the care of events unto God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth Chriſt draw them, who were affected with fear of dangers, to conſider ſeriouſly what calling there was for that undertaking. 2. As the Lord hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the children of men by appointing unto them lawful callings, wherein they may ſerve him, whatever their calling be in it ſelfe; So he hath appointed times and opportunities of theſe callings, which are not to be neglected: for, a calling is like <hi>the day,</hi> wherein a man may <hi>walk,</hi> and <hi>there are twelve houres in this day,</hi> that is, a prefixed time for going about this calling, (as there is for day-light;) which is not be neglected, more then a man would neglect the day time to go about his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it. The expreſſion alludes to the cuſtome of the Jewes, who divided the day and the night, each of them in twelve houres, and that both ſummer and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only they ſhortned the houres of the day in winter, and lengthned them in ſummer; and ſo, (contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) the hours of the night. 3. A man that followeth a calling from God, and emproveth all the opportunities thereof, is in a ſafe courſe, and ſo needs fear no danger; for, as, <hi>if any man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth the light of this world,</hi> or the ſun; ſo he that hath the light of his calling, needs not ſtumble, but that may be to him as day-light is to paſſengers. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. For, albeit following of Gods call will not alwayes keep men from trouble, but Chriſt himſelf,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48148:115"/>
when his courſe was finiſhed, and very ſhortly after this met with it: Yet, 1. They will get their day finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall not be interrupted till they have finiſhed their work, as Chriſts experience teacheth, See <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.31, 32. 2. If they be not kept from difficulties, yet following their calling, they are kept from the guilt of procuring them ſinfully. 3 They may be ſure they ſhall be bleſſed, and 4. That God who employes them, will make up all their loſſes to them So that the clearneſſe of Gods call affords more peace, then all the difficulties men can m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As men who run on danger without a calling, may meet with many a ſnare; So they who neglect Gods call for fear of trial, may meet with ſover difficulties in their own way; for, <hi>if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth becauſe there is no light in him,</hi> to take up hazards, which God hath appointed the Sun to point out unto men. The meaning is, not only that he who runs without a call, ſtumbleth, but that as a man who, having buſineſs to do in the day time, yet, doth not ſet out till night, doth exceedingly prejudge himſelfe; ſo he who either rejects Gods call, and takes him to follow his own counſels, or he who fits the opportunities of doing his calling, and comes too late, may meet with ſharp trials.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt having in general, cleared the uſefulneſſe and ſafety that is in following a calling, doth, in this ſecond part of the anſwer, clear his own calling to this journy in particular, to wit, that he might raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was now dead. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt hath an honourable relation unto, and a neere intereſt in them that beleeve; for, he is the <hi>friend Lazarus.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Jam</hi> 2.23. 2. The death of beleevers doth not break off Chriſts relations or friendſhip to them, but he will remember them for good, even when they are dead; for, he is <hi>friend Lazarus</hi> when dead, and <hi>I go to awake him</hi> 3. Such as are friends to Chriſt, ought alſo to be looked on as friends, by all Chriſts followers; Therefore, doth he ſay, <hi>Our friend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> 4. Albeit death be a common lot to the godly and wicked; yet Chriſtians ought to have Chriſtian conceptions, and Chriſtian expreſſions of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the nature thereof is changed to them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, <hi>Lazarus ſleepeth,</hi> which name is given to death, not only becauſe he was ſhortly to raiſe him up, as eaſily as one awakes a ſleeping man (and ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſaith, <hi>I go that I may awake him,</hi> See alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.52. &amp;c) but alſo, becauſe death is a ſweet ſleep to the godly, and a reſt from their labours, till the morning of the reſurrection, that he raiſe them up to inherite glory, <hi>Rev</hi> 14.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. 5. When Chriſt propounds difficulties to his people, he hath alſo the remedy in his own hand; and when we are called to ſtudy difficulties, he warrants us alſo to ſtudy what he can do for us under them; Therefore, unto this, that <hi>Lazarus ſleepeth,</hi> he ſubjoynes, <hi>but I go that I may awake him.</hi> 6. It is a calling to Chriſt, to go where he may do good to any of his own, were it through never ſo many difficulties and dangers; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne this to the former general doctrine, as clearing his calling to this journey in particular, <hi>Theſe things ſaid he, and after that he ſaith unto them Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth, but I go, &amp;c.</hi> 7. Chriſt alone will have the glory of the good done to his people, and will not ſuffer any to ſhare with him; for, albeit he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to go with him, as companions in the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. yet he will acknowledge no companions in the miracle, <hi>I go that I may awake him.</hi> 8. Chriſt will chooſe that way of working for his people that may moſt manifeſt his own glory, albeit it ſhould be a way full of hazard, of delayes, and diſcoveries of his peoples weakneſſe; Therefore, whereas they might object, that he might more eaſily ſend his word of power, which might do the work more ſpeedily, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.49, 50. and with leſſe hazard, and cauſe of fainting fear to them; Yet, ſaith he, <hi>I go,</hi> that the glory of the miracle might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even diſciples are ready to miſtake and miſunderſtand Chriſts minde and words; for, ſo they underſtand Chriſts words otherwiſe then he meant them. 2. One great cauſe of our miſtakes, is, the averſeneſſe of our minde from knowing any thing but what we pleaſe; and that our corrupt affections do oft-times guide our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for, the diſciples being averſe from ſuffering, and glad of any excuſe to keep out of <hi>Judea,</hi> do grip to Chriſts expreſſion of <hi>ſleep,</hi> to gather this faire pretence from it, <hi>Lord, if he ſleep, he ſhall do well;</hi> whereas, if their paſſions and diſtempers had not blinded them, they might eaſily have perceived, that Chriſt meant more by that expreſſion; ſeeing he would not have undertaken ſuch a journey, meerly to awake a ſleeping friend out of a refreſhful ſleep. 3. It is no eaſie matter to bring even diſciples to ſubmit to Gods will, when it croſſeth their own diſpoſitions; for, after all that Chriſt had ſaid, they bewray that they continue ſtill averſe from going to <hi>Judea.</hi> 4.

                     </gap>. 3. Whatever may be the Saints thoughts of Chriſts dealing under their diſtreſſes, yet his way of dealing is ſtill the beſt; and he can give a good account that it is ſo, to ſatisfie their miſtakes: As here he obviats all carping at his abſence, by ſhewing that if he had been there, he could not have refuſed the ſupplications of the ſiſters, to prevent <hi>Lazarus</hi> death; and ſo there had not been ſo glorious a miracle wrought for confirmation of faith. Whereas now, both his omniſcience is evidenced, in telling of <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, and the miracle ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce profitable effects. 4. Chriſt can not only give an account of his ſeeming ſtrange diſpenſations, but can produce matter of joy even out of the ſaddeſt of them; for, albeit <hi>Lazarus</hi> be dead, and his ſiſters drowned in ſorrow, yet, ſaith he, <hi>I am glad that I was not there,</hi> to prevent it. Not that he wanted ſympathy, but that he knew how to bring joy out of it. 5. As Chriſt mindes his own glory in all his working; ſo he joynes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the promoving of the true good of his people; for, this ſickneſſe and death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is not only <hi>for the glory of God,</hi> ver. 4. but <hi>for your ſakes,</hi> and good. So that Saints will finde his glory and their good ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on together. 6. Chriſt in afflicting any of his own, mindes not only their own particular good, but the good of other Saints alſo; by their obſerving the proofes of Chriſt, manifeſted upon, and to the afflicted; for not only <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but the diſciples, (and ſiſters alſo) get good and confirmation out of the trial, and the iſſue of it. 7. Even ſuch as live under the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent miniſtry, for a long time, and are very eminent in Chriſts houſe, and who have ſeen much of Chriſt, may yet be very weak in faith, and need confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for, albeit theſe were called to be Apoſtles, and had ſeen the moſt of all Chriſts miracles, and lived under Chriſts miniſtry, till now that it is near an end; yet even at this time they need help to beleeve, or to be confirmed and ſtrengthened in it, <hi>That ye may beleeve.</hi> And it is ſtill of general verity, that whatever faith Saints have, yet it needs daily confirmation and growth. 8. Confirmation and ſtrengthening of faith is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uſeful, that it is not to be thought ſtrange, if Chriſt ſend ſharp trials, on our ſelves or others, to bring that about; Yea, a Saint is highly honoured, when God afflicts him moſt ſharply, if his afflictions and the iſſues of them, be a mean to confirme others; Therefore Chriſt thinks, <hi>Lazarus</hi> pain in his ſickneſſe and death, and the ſharp ſorrow of his ſiſters, but a ſmall thing, and not to be ſtood upon, if it produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of faith, even in Diſciples; <hi>I am glad I was not there, to the intent ye may beleeve.</hi> 9. As any thing that may advance our good, is matter of Chriſts joy; ſo in particular, there is nothing more pleaſant unto him, then to have his people beleeving and growing in faith, <hi>I am glad, to the intent ye may beleeve</hi> 10. Albeit Chriſts abſence from his people for a time, may ſeem to diſcourage them much, yet very abſence may tend to the ſtrengthening of their faith afterwards; for <hi>I was not there, to the intent ye may beleeve.</hi> 11. Whatever incouragement Chriſt allow upon his people, yet it is not to be expected that he will allow them their own deſired eaſe, by ſhifting their duty for any danger; for, albeit he point out all theſe ſolid grounds of comfort, yet go to <hi>Judea</hi> they muſt, <hi>Nevertheleſſe let us go.</hi> And indeed, if they had gotten their own deſired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, they had miſſed of all theſe true comforts. 12. Inability and impotency in the needy, will not hinder a meeting betwixt Chriſt and them, but he will go to them, who cannot come to him; for, ſuch is his dealing to dead <hi>Lazarus, Let us go unto him.</hi> 13. Chriſts going unto, or dealing even with the dead, is not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but to good purpoſe; for, albeit it ſhould ſeeme it were too late to go now, <hi>nevertheleſſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let us go unto him.</hi>

                  <p>This conference cloſeth with a particular diſcovery of <hi>Thomas, Didymus,</hi> or, the twin, as his name <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the Hebrew alſo imports. He ſeeing Chriſt ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, invites the reſt to go and dye with him, not with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but with Chriſt: And the meaning is, That ſince Chriſt would not follow their counſel, but would run on his own death; there was nothing better for them, then to run on the hazard with him, and ſo once be out of troubles and fears. In this reſolution there doth indeed appear. 1. Affection, in cleaving unto Chriſt, and, 2. Zeal in exciting others to the ſame. Yet this reſolution is but full of fear and diſſidence, for, had he beleeved what was ſpoken <hi>ver</hi> 15. he would not have expected this iſſue of the journey. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. It is the duty of Chriſts followers not to quit him, though it ſhould coſt them their lives; for, ſo much doth this reſolution teach. 2. It is their duty alſo, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48148:116"/>
excite one another to duty, in times of hazard; <hi>Let us go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and die.</hi> 3. Chriſts followers have more fears and ſad apprehenſions, then there is juſt cauſe; for, <hi>let us go and die,</hi> when Chriſt had told of another thing, imports ſo much. This produced an untimous exerciſe about ſuffering, wherein he proved not ſo reſolute, when he was called to it. 4. It breeds men much needleſſe exerciſe, that they will not beleeve nor expect the good that Chriſt promiſeth them, but will judge of all things by their own apprehenſions; for, ſo was it with him, his eye was ſo on feared danger, as he little regarded what Chriſt had promiſed. 5. The Lord doth not approve of that reſolution in dutie or ſuffering, that doth not ſlow from faith, but from diſtruſt; for, herein did <hi>Thomas</hi> reſolution faile. 6. The Lord alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes mens willingneſſe to ſuffer, when it proceeds from a deſperate wearing of their preſent lot, which makes them content to rid themſelves of it by ſharp ſufferings; for, this was alſo one of his faults, as hath been before explained.</p>

Unto which, and theſe that follow a preface and introduction is premitted in theſe verſes, which will give light to the following purpoſe. And namely there is recorded. 1. The length of time ſince <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was to be raiſed, had been buried: Jeſus findes that is was foure dayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. 2. The near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Bethany</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (namely, that it was a furlong leſſe then two miles, eight furlongs making a mile) is marked, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And that as for other reaſons, ſo alſo to point out a reaſon why ſo many Jewes came to bear <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> company, which is the third thing premitted, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. While as it is ſaid, <hi>Jeſus found he had lien foure dayes,</hi> we need not enquire how he found it, for we may conceive that as he knew of his death before, and told of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 14. So now he found by report and information that it was as he knew: As indeed, his knowledge is infallible. Though it may be alſo aſſerted in general, that Chriſt as man (being freely acted by the Godhead) was ſinleſſely ignorant of ſome things not incumbent to his calling, and did learn from experience, information, &amp;c. <hi>Luk</hi> 2.52. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32. And by this, he would curb the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wit of man, who would preſume to know all things; And doth condeſcend to theſe who are ignorant of many things, providing they know what is incumbent to them in their ſtations. 2. Chriſt will have the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his own ſingular, and remarked to be ſo, that his glory may be ſingular in ridding them out of theſe; Therefore, it is premitted that <hi>he had lien in the grave foure dayes already,</hi> that his glory in raiſing him might be the greater, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it might be ſeen that however he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, yet he came in time enough to raiſe him, as is after cleared. For this produced more fruit in his own, then if he had not died, or had been but new dead; and it made his death to be devulged at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as appears by their coming to comfort the ſiſters, that ſo malice it ſelfe might not doubt of the miracle. 3. Such as have gotten good news from Chriſt concerning their difficulties; may yet meet with many ſeeming ſad diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, before they finde them accompliſhed; for, they got newes, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>this ſickneſſe is not unto death,</hi> and yet he is not only dead, but <hi>had lien in the grave foure dayes.</hi> 4. Mens exerciſe of their calling may lie very near to hazards, that ſo they may exerciſe faith in God, for, <hi>Bethany,</hi> the place where Chriſts calling lay, <hi>was nigh unto Jeruſalem,</hi> where his cruel enemies were, and where he was to ſuffer, <hi>even about fifteen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs off.</hi> 5. It is not inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity, to have moderate ſorrow for the loſſe of friends, and to be ſo affected, as to need comfort: for, <hi>Martha and Mary</hi> need ſome <hi>to comfort them concerning their brother.</hi> Only that they do come to <hi>comfort,</hi> it ſhewes, that the ſorrow ſhould be moderate, and that the mourners ſhould not reject conſolation. 6. It is the duty of friends and neighbours, to ſympathize with, and comfort others, in diſtreſſe; for, ſo much were theſe Jewes convinced of, who came (from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as is to be gathered from <hi>verſe</hi> 18.) <hi>to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brother.</hi> 7. It is a ſpecial advantage, when God caſts friends and comforters to be near peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they ſtand in need of them; Therefore alſo, it is marked, that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whence they came, <hi>was nigh to Bethany. Job</hi> had his friends further off. 8. Men may, upon ſome reſpects, love ſome who are truely godly, and yet not love Chriſt, nor yet love others who bear the ſame image; for, as yet (as would appear from <hi>ver.</hi> 45.) none of theſe beleeved in Chriſt, and ſo could not love him, and ſome of them were violent enemies; and yet they loved theſe godly women, and <hi>came to comfort them.</hi> It may be, becauſe they were eminent women, they are reſpected; And many who will not look on Chriſt, will yet look to any who are in eminency: And therefore, the good that is in ſuch, would be cheriſhed, if ſo be it may gain others. It is alſo ordinary for natural men, to like the parts of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons, when yet they do not love their graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whatever it be, certainly it is upon ſome by-reſpect that this love is founded.</p>

She, though a good woman, and ſenſible of her loſſe alſo, yet being of a ſtronger minde then <hi>Mary,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtirring moſt up and down, gets firſt word of Chriſts approach, and goeth to meet him; whereas <hi>Mary</hi> knowing nothing of this, ſtayes ſtill within. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As among he truely gracious, ſome are more tender and ſpiritual then others So the moſt godly are ordinarily moſt affected with griefes, and more broken under them, then others; for, <hi>Martha</hi> is able to ſtir, and gets newes of Chriſt, while as tender <hi>Mary</hi> ſits ſtill under her ſorrows, and hears of no ſuch thing. This may teach the godly, and eſpecially weak and tender hearted ones, not to meaſure every one by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for, theſe who have real good, may have really different diſpoſitions, and ſome come far ſhort of others; And it may teach them whoſe mindes are broken and made tender, as to guard leſt every difficulty take too deep impreſſion, ſo alſo to expect more liberal allowance from Chriſt, as <hi>Mary</hi> afterward found. 2. Whatever comfort or ſympathy men meet with from friends in their trouble; yet comfort from Chriſt alſo will be needed by all the godly; for, albeit they had comforters, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. yet ſhe <hi>went and met him,</hi> when ſhe heard of his coming, to welcome him as a needful guheſt; And it may be ſhe me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> him without, as fearing hazard to him from the Jewes that were in the houſe. 3. <hi>Martha</hi> had her own prejudice at Chriſts carriage, that he had not come ſooner, as appears afterward, as well as ſhe had faith; and yet faith prevails that ſhe ſtayes not from him, but goeth to him: It teacheth, that unbelief is never deadly, ſo long as a man is not kept from coming to Chriſt by it; And whatever complaints a man have of Chriſts dealing, yet faith is ſtill the conquerour, ſo long as all theſe complaints are poured out only in Chriſts own boſome.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, we have <hi>Martha's</hi> ſalutation and diſcourſe to Chriſt at meeting; wherein. 1. Her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion breaks out in an indirect challenge (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) that his preſence might have prevented her brothers death, and therefore regrates that he came not in time. And in this her weakneſſe appears, not only in her indirect challenge; But partly, in her preſumption, beleeving that for which ſhe had no ground. For upon what ground could ſhe know, but Chriſt might have been there, and yet her brother have died, ſeeing there was no promiſe to the contrary? And partly, in her limiting of Chriſts power to his bodily preſence, as if he could not have prevented his death, if he had pleaſed, though he had not been there. 2. After her paſſion hath brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out, ſhe ſettles a little, and corrects it with a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her faith, that Chriſt, if he pleaſed, could yet amend all, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Though in this alſo her faith came ſhort in, that ſhe beleeves not Chriſt can do this by his own power, but only as an inſtrument employing God, or obtaining power of God to do it, as was the way of men of God in former times.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The dear children of God have ſo much weakneſſe and corruption, as to flee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut againſt Chriſts way of dealing towards them, when they are in trouble; for, ſo much doth this indirect chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge teach. 2. Albeit Saints may have much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at their engaging in a trial, yet they may be ready to ſtagger, if Chriſt put them to it, to give a real proofe of that ſubmiſſion; for, albeit their meſſage to Chirſt <hi>ver.</hi> 3. ſpoke much ſubmiſſion, and a referring of all to his will; yet here the declares that the cannot digeſt that it hath pleaſed him to let her brother die. 3. It is not eaſie for Saints to take up Chriſt, and faſten their faith upon him aright; And in particular, it is ſometime their fault, that they give more credit to the preſumptuous drams of their own hearts, for which they have no warrant, then to what Chriſt reveals of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for, ſhe ſtrongly aſſerts <hi>if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died,</hi> for which ſhe had no ground at all. And, generally, it is the fault of men, that in the point of truſt and diffidence, they make a Bible of their own thoughts, apprehenſions, and fears, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Scripture ſaith. 4. It is alſo the fault of Saints, that in beleeving Chriſts power and good will to do for them, they yet limit him to their own conceived way of working, out of which they do not expect any thing from him: And particularly, it is their great fault to limit his effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acy and power to his bodily preſence; for herein alſo ſhe failed, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the preſervation of her brothers life, unleſſe Chriſt <hi>had been there,</hi> whereas he could have done it at never ſo great a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Paſſion, when it is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Saints, is haſty, and firſt out, and takes the ſtart of their better reſolutions; for, here it hath broken firſt out, whereas ſhe hath better ſtuffe within, here produced. And therefore, as we are in ſtraits, to ſuſpect that which poſtes firſt to the doore, to get out; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11. and 31, 22. So Saints paſſions, though they ought not to be juſtified, yet they ought not to be too narrowly examined and cenſured, as being but a violent tentation, treading upon grace for a ſeaſon. 2. It is ſinful in any, and particularly unſeemly in a childe of God, to perſiſt in his paſſion, when it hath burſt forth; but he ought to revoke and correct it by faith: As here <hi>Martha</hi> ſubjoynes a correction to the former expreſſions. 3. There is nothing can fall out, nor can the child of Gods condition come to ſuch an height, nor can the fruits of delayes and diſappointments be ſo deſperate and deadly but faith will ſee that it may all be yet amended and made up againe, Therefore, albeit it was a ſore daſh that Chriſt came not till he was dead, yet ſaith ſhe, <hi>I know that even now,</hi> all may be well enough. 4. It may exceedingly encourage Saints to beleeve, when they conſider that Gods power is not limited, and that the Interceſſour, whom they employ, will not be refuſed in any thing he craves: for, on this doth ſhe build; <hi>I know that whatſoever thou wilt ask of God,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48148:117"/>
God will give it thee,</hi> 5. Faith, even when it goeth very far on in giving glory unto Chriſt, doth yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily come far ſhort of what is his due; and when faith ſleeth a very high pitch, it may yet be full of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for, ſo was it in her faith, and her correcting of her former diſtemper. She beleeves only if he ask, God will give; whereas, albeit indeed as Mediatour and man, he did employ the Father by prayer, of which we will hear, <hi>ver.</hi> 41, 42. Yet as God, he wrought miracles by his own power, communicate with his eſſence from the Father, by eternal generation.</p>

                  <p>In the third place, we have Chriſts meek anſwer to her diſcourſe; Wherein paſſing over her infirmitie, he comforts her with a promiſe, that her brother ſhall riſe again. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Great are the conſolations which God hath laid up for his afflicted people; and he will do great things for them, in ſo far as he ſeeth good; for, ſo much doth this wonderful promiſe, given for <hi>Martha's</hi> comfort, import. 2. It is a ſatisfactory and proper conſolation againſt the death of theſe we love, to beleeve a reſurrection, wherein they ſhall be reſtored again; for, by this doth Chriſt comfort her, <hi>Thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall riſe again.</hi> 3. Chriſt doth propound this promiſe only in general tearmes, <hi>He ſhall riſe again,</hi> not mentioning the time when it ſhould be: And this he doth, partly, to ſhew that however he was to raiſe her brother preſently; yet the very general promiſe of a general reſurrection, is full of comfort, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4.13, 14, &amp;c. And therefore he propounds her encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe tearmes, left any ſhould ſtumble, who have no warrand to expect ſuch a particular favour. Partly, he doth it, for the exerciſe of her faith, and to let ſee, in her practice, how far ſhort our expectations may be of what Chriſt will do for his people; (ſhee looks for reſurrection at the laſt day, he is to raiſe her brother preſently) And partly, that he may let in her conſolation by degrees into her narrow mouthed veſſel; For as Saints may be allowed to beleeve and expect a mercy, when yet they cannot reſolve every particular circumſtance, how, or when, or by what means it ſhall come to paſſe, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.14. ſo they are ſo ſhallow, as they can take in mercies but here a little, and there a little.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the fourth place, we have <hi>Martha's</hi> exception upon this promiſe and offered comfort; Wherein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſhe profeſſe faith of a general reſurrection and judgement; yet ſhe ſeems to look on that as not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for her encouragement, ſeeing it is common to all, and but far off. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It ought to be out of all contraverſie among Chriſtians, that there will be a day of judgement at the cloſe of time, and a general reſurrection of all the dead, for that end; for, <hi>Martha</hi> beleeves this, though the Paedagogy of the law was not yet expired, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the reſurrection, at the laſt day.</hi> 2. Such is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, and their doating on their particular ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfaction, that they are ready to ſleight all the mercies and conſolations of God, unleſſe they get that which they account a mercy; Therefore, albeit the general reſurrection be no ſmall comfort, and the reſurrection of the juſt be far better, then to be reſtored again to the toiles of this life; Yet ſhe undervalues all that, in compariſon of her getting again her brother preſently. 3. It is no ſtrange thing, to ſee men beleeving great things that are far off, and about which they have no preſent exerciſe, when yet their faith proves weak in the matter of their preſent trial, even albeit it be leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then that which they profeſſe to beleeve; for, ſhe can beleeve the reſurrection of all men, and of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, at the laſt day; when yet ſhe ſtaggers at the matter of his being raiſed preſently, and yet the one is as difficult as the other, and more difficult alſo.</p>

                  <p>In the fifth place, we have Chriſts reply to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for underſtanding whereof, we are to conſider, that whatever faith <hi>Martha</hi> hath hitherto profeſſed, Yet, 1 She hath not looked on Chriſt as able to do any thing by his own power, but only by employing God in prayer. 2. She hath indeed profeſſed her faith of a general reſurrection, but doubted of her brothers being raiſed even now. 3. And in what ſhe beleeves of a general reſurrection, ſhe makes no mention of Chriſts power to do it. Therefore, Chriſt fits his anſwer to cure theſe evils in her; Wherein, firſt, He layeth down a general aſſertion, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life,</hi> that is, (if we take this truth in its full latitude, and with an eye to Chriſts whole ſcope here) He is the author of all reſurrection, and of all life, whether bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or ſpiritual; as having abſolute power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over death, as God, and being life it ſelfe: And therefore as he was to be eyed in her beleeving the general reſurrection; So his power to raiſe and quicken the dead at that time, was ſufficient to prove he could even now raiſe her brother. And according to this interpretation, his being <hi>the life,</hi> which is ſubjoyned to his being <hi>the reſurrection,</hi> is not neceſſarily here to be underſtood only of that eternal life, unto which the juſt are raiſed by Chriſt, and of which he gave a pledge, by his raiſing up himſelfe, as Mediatour; But it is to be taken generally, that he, as God, hath power to raiſe whom, and when he will, as being the fountain of life, to give life to whom he will. But if we look to the purpoſe immediately ſubjoyned, we may take this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more ſtrictly, and in a ſpiritual ſenſe, That he is <hi>the reſurrection,</hi> in his firſt giving of ſpiritual life unto dead ſinners, which is further explained in the end of

This interpretation as it is true in it ſelfe, and agreeable to what followeth; So it needs not ſeclude the other, which is more general, and reacheth Chriſts full ſcope: But may come in as a particular ſpecialy comprehended under it, as appears by his own Commentary ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. And therefore, Secondly, He illuſtrates and confirmes this general in a two-fold particular aſſertion. One is, <hi>He that beleeveth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live;</hi> which though it conclude well, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of a bodily reſurrection; That they who cloſe by him with faith, albeit they uſe bodily, yet he will raiſe them up to live again, and can do to when he pleaſeth, Yet comparing it with the following verſe, which is conjoined with it, by the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ather to underſtand it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and that Chriſt is here proving himſelfe to be the ſpiritual <hi>reſurrection</hi> of a dead ſinner, and that they who, being dead by nature, do lay hold on him by ſaith, ſhall partake of the firſt reſurrection, and be made to live a life of grace. And upon this doth the ſecond aſſertion fitly follow, <hi>whoſoever liveth and beleeveth in me ſhall never die,</hi> wherein he aſſures her, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are delivered from ſpiritual and eternal death. And ſo this adds to the former; For as in the former, he proves himſelfe chiefly to be <hi>the reſurrection,</hi> by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up the dead to a ſtate of life; ſo here he confirmes further how he is <hi>the life,</hi> by preſerving and keeping in that life eternally, which he had conferred upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and ſtated them in it. And this doctrine doth very well agree with Chriſts ſcope in this place; For hereby he not only leads <hi>Martha,</hi> to eye him m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt is to be looked on, not as the inſtrument of life and reſurrection to any, but as the author and principal worker thereof by his own power; for, albeit many Prophets and Apoſtles have raiſed the dead, yet it can be ſaid of none but he, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life.</hi> 4.

As the children of God are by regeneration, put in a ſtate of life; ſo they prove it by their after carriage, by exerciſing the functions of ſpiritual life, and being lively in their way; for, he to whom Chriſt is the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> to quicken him when he is dead, <hi>he liveth</hi> 2. As ſpiritual life flowes only from Chriſt embraced by faith; ſo it muſt be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerved by the ſame mean of faith in Chriſt; for, as the dead, by beleeving, do live, ſo <hi>he that liveth, muſt beleeve in me,</hi> ſaith he. The keeping in of our ſpiritual life is a continued reſurrection, as the preſervation of the creatures is a continued creation; And as the ſame power is employed in begetting and entertaining this life; ſo the ſame mean of faith muſt ſtill be kept in exerciſe. So that they are exceedingly in the wrong, who in their defections and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The power of Chriſt will be forth coming, to preſerve beleevers in him from an utter decay in their ſpiritual life; So that albeit they may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with ſome degrees of death, yet upon renewing of their faith, they ſhall be recovered out of their ſwounds.

He will alſo preſerve them from eternal death, and bodily death it ſelfe ſhall not extinguiſh the life that is begotten and entertained by faith in Jeſus Chriſt; for, <hi>he that liveth and beleeveth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> 4. It is the will of God, that when he reveals truth, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it by faith, and do not either reject it, or give only a general aſſent to it in our judgements; Therefore doth he poſe her, <hi>Beleeveſt thou this?</hi> and thus ſhould we daily poſe our own hearts. 5. In particular, it is neceſſary that we be well grounded in the faith of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life through Chriſt, and that we make ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the general promiſe made by him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and that faith be not to ſeek in a pinch when Chriſt calls for it; for, it is in theſe matters that he requires her to profeſſe her faith, <hi>Beleeveſt thou this?</hi>

                  <p>In the laſt place, we have <hi>Martha's</hi> anſwer to this queſtion; wherein, ſhe aſſents unto what Chriſt had required her to beleeve, and ads a confeſſion of her faith concerning his perſon and offices, which ſhe profeſſeth ſhe <hi>hath beleeved</hi> before, as it is in the original. This ſhe ſubjoynes, not only as the ground of her faith in this particular, unto which ſhe now aſſents, But her weak grip (as would appear) not being able expreſſely to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all this which he hath ſpoken, though ſhe aſſent unto it; Therefore ſhe paſſeth it in a word, and profeſſeth her faith concerning his perſon and office, acknowledging him to be the promiſed Meſſiah, the Sonne of God, and conſequently, profeſſeth ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth all that may flow from this. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Weak faith may grow up to more clearneſſe and aſſurance, by converſing and conference with Chriſt, laying open our weakneſſes to him, and receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from him; for, her anſwer to Chriſts queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, <hi>Yea, Lord,</hi> affirming that ſhe beleeved it, (though yet weakly) and ſo ſhe is brought a further length then ſhe had attained before, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. 2. In the matter of encouragements and promiſes, the Lord hath ſo ordered it, that ſome ſhould be fundamentals (ſuch as, the promiſe, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> the truths concerning Chriſts perſon and offices, &amp;c.) which comprehend many promiſes in them; the reſt being but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application of theſe generals to particular caſes; As here her practice inſinuates, recurring to this, as a chiefe and comprehenſive ground of comfort, that he is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 3. The conſequences that flow from theſe fundamental encouragements and promiſes, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo full, that one, who beleeveth the firſt, may yet not ſee theſe conſequences ſo clearly, nor yet ſo firmely beleeve all that flows from it; for, <hi>Martha</hi> (as would appear) cannot get all this ſo diſtinctly gripped; when yet ſhe beleeves that he is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. from which all of it neceſſarily flows. At leaſt, this is clear, that ſhe <hi>hath beleeved,</hi> that he is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. even when ſhe doubted of this particular which he calls her to beleeve. And this lets us ſee, that they who beleeve theſe general encouragements, have much more to be refreſhed with, then they have well conſidered; and, that it is of Gods rich love, condeſcending to our weakneſſe, that he draws out theſe generals in particular promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to our particular neceſſities. 4. When our faith ſtaggers in any particular exigent, or proves weak in beleeving particular promiſes; it is our duty to recurre to theſe general grounds of faith and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hold them faſt till we get more, and ſtudy the fulneſſe that is in them, that we may be led on to more particular confidence; for, ſuch is her practice; whatever her former doubting, or preſent weakneſſe in beleeving were, yet ſhe beleeves, and hath beleeved, that he is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. The ſtudying of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and offices is a notable mean to confirme our faith in all the promiſes concerning all the benefits to be had in him; for, this ſhe layeth hold on for that end, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou art the Chriſt, the Sonne of God which ſhould come into the world.</hi> The ſtudy of this will make us ſure both of his good will, as Mediators, and power, as God, to do what he promiſeth. 6. Chriſt is never rightly beleeved in, nor taken up, except he be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Meſſiah promiſed unto the Fathers, and the eternal Sonne of God; for, ſo much doth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion point out concerning him. 7. Chriſt was not unknown under the Old Teſtament, but was revealed and held forth in the promiſe; And accordingly, the godly did cloſe with him by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. And as they ſaw him to be true God, ſo they did expect and wait for him to come into the world, at the appointed time, made of a woman, and ſo to be God and man in one perſon: for, ſaith ſhe, <hi>thou art the Chriſt the Sonne of God, which ſhould come into the world,</hi> intimating that he was revealed, and accordingly beleeved in, and expected by them before he came; and that they acknowledged him, who was to <hi>come into the world,</hi> by his being made fleſh, to be God, <hi>the Sonne of God.</hi> 8. All Gods promiſes of and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah, were fulfilled and accompliſhed in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of <hi>Mary;</hi> for, ſaith ſhe of him now exhibited, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Sonne of God which ſhould come into the world,</hi> So that there is no other to be expected. And as this was true of his perſon, ſo all other predictions, concerning the Meſſiah, in his life, death, reſurrection, &amp;c. were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in him, as is frequently obſerved and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New Teſtament. And this may aſſure us, that all Gods promiſes ſhall be fulfilled in him to his people. 8. True faith in Chriſt will not judge of him by outward appearance, nor outward lots, but will pierce through all theſe clouds, and ſee his glory; for, when he is in the forme of a ſervant, and lately driven from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet ſaith ſhe, <hi>I beleeve thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi>

Newes of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach will make fainting mourners revive, and be active to run and meet him; for, ſhe who ſate drooping and faint in the houſe, as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 31. now, <hi>when ſhe heard that, ſhe aroſe quickly and came to him.</hi> 3. Such as have the opportunity of comfort from Chriſt, will preferre him to all the comforts they can receive from friends; Therefore <hi>ſhe aroſe quickly, and came to him,</hi> leaving all that were in the houſe comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. 4. In the dayes of Chriſts fleſh, his calling went neareſt his heart of any thing, and he preferred the opportunities of doing good, to all his own caſe and accommodations: Therefore it is marked, as a reaſon why <hi>Mary</hi> went out unto him, <hi>Jeſus was not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.</hi> He had not ſo much as entered the town to refreſh himſelfe, not for fear of the Jewes, (for his hand and providence brings them out afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 31,) but he chooſed this as a ſit time and place to comfort <hi>Mary</hi> in, and his minde was upon working the miracle before he reſted. And all this tends to ſhew what a faithful and merciful high Prieſt he is, and how enlarged his heart is toward his people, when now he hath no particular neceſſity of his own, to divert him.</p>

                  <p>In the third place, is recorded how the Jewes who comforted her, conſtructed of her going out, as if ſhe were going to weep at the grave, (as it ſeems this cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtome had crept in among them) and therefore they follow her, to interrupt her. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as are moſt tender, and moſt ſenſibly affected and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with trials, may expect not only greater ſympathy from Chriſt, but alſo that (in ſo far as it is good for them) he will ſtir up other inſtruments, to take a more hearty life at their condition; for, ſo much appears in the practice of theſe Jewes, who perceiving <hi>Maries</hi> greater need, ſate <hi>with her in the houſe, and comforted her, and roſe up haſtily and followed her,</hi> when ſhe went out, whereas, it appears, they had taken little notice of <hi>Martha's</hi> going out or coming in. 2. It is a ſinful practice of our nature, to ad to the burdens laid upon us by God, and feed our own ſorrows, by penſive thinking or looking upon that wherein God afflicts us; for, their apprehenſion upon her going out, intimates they had ſome ſuch cuſtome among them, of <hi>going to graves, to weep there,</hi> that the ſight of their loſſe might waken their ſorrow. 3. It is no wonder to ſee the world and natural men miſtake the wayes of the godly, and to ſee, even their natural comforters in trouble, judge of them according to their own carnal principles and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for, albeit there be no appearance that <hi>Mary</hi> had uſed this practice before, yet they miſconſtruct her going out, <hi>ſhe goeth to the grave to weep there,</hi> not only becauſe they knew not her calling to go to Chriſt, but this being natures practice, they could judge no better of her. 4. It is our duty to reſtrain carnal ſorrow, if it were but by interrupting thereof, if we cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted under it; for, ſo much doth their practice teach,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48148:119"/>
                     <hi>they roſe up haſtily, and followed her,</hi> thinking to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſcarre her from her weeping, if ſhe would not be recalled by them. 5. The Lords providence doth oft-times tryſt men, in following their ordinary duty, with very unexpected favours; for, while they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Mary,</hi> to moderate her ſorrows, providence leads them out to Chriſt, and to be witneſſes of a glorious miracle. 6. There is much good to be gotten in the fellowſhip of the godly, and in ſtudying to be ſteadable and comfortable to them in their diſtreſſe; for, it is in <hi>Maries</hi> company, and while they are comforting her, they meet with this favour.</p>

Chriſt takes pleaſure to anſwer his peoples neceſſities, by deeds as well as by words, and (ſo to ſay) to do and act his love, as well as to ſay it; Yea, in great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, he will not delay his peoples help ſo long as even to comfort them by words; Therefore, albeit it be his ordinary way, to comfort his people, firſt by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Zech</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. and then, by actings; and albeit he dealt ſo with <hi>Martha;</hi> Yet, ſeeing <hi>Maries</hi> great need and his heart being weighted, he ſayes no more, but will go to the action. 3. Albeit Chriſt will ſpeedily help his needy people, yet he will ſo order his working, as his glory may be moſt conſpicuous in it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, albeit he could have raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and made him come to them where they ſtood; and albeit he knew well enough where the grave was; yet he will enquire for it, and have them to conduct him to it, that ſo he may free this miracle from any ſuſpition of illuſion, and may have them to be witneſſes of his glory in it.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Sonne of God did take on mans nature, and dwelt in our fleſh, that he might lay a foundation of reconciliation betwixt God and man, in his own perſon; So alſo he did take on theſe ſinleſſe affections and infirmities, which might not only prove him to be true man, but that he is a kindly brother and kinſman to miſerable men, and might be a fit conduct to conveigh theſe bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that are in God, toward loſt man; for, ſo much is evidenced by his <hi>weeping.</hi> 2. Chriſt, in the daies of his fleſh, was a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefes, that therein men might read the bitter fruits of ſinne, and they who flee to him, may have matter of joy for ever; Therefore, it is marked that <hi>Jeſus wept,</hi> which alſo was his frequent practice. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. 3. Chriſt hath no light touch of the miſeries of his own, but they do deeply afflict and affect him; for, he groans and is troubled, till he <hi>wept</hi> again. 4. Chriſt allowes not that his affection and ſympathy be hid from his afflicted people; but he would have them knowing it, and convinced of it; for, therefore, doth his groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trouble burſt forth in <hi>weeping,</hi> to be diſcerned by the beholders, as <hi>ver.</hi> 36. 5. Chriſts tenderneſſe and affection to his afflicted people will not long be hid or concealed, but it will burſt forth through never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clouds; for, when he is troubled, he will at laſt <hi>weep</hi> alſo in view of them all. Thus when he is dealing moſt harſhly with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet at laſt his heart cannot hide it ſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in his dealing with his brethren, was a type of him. 6. Chriſts inward exerciſe burſting forth in weeping, may ſerve alſo further to teach. 1. That all who get their bitter and ſad exerciſe and ſorrows ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that they break not out to the diſhonour of God, or weakening of the hands of others, have him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, who by venting his ſorrows, both here, and elſewhere, eſpecially on the croſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. hath ſhut up theirs. 2. That, on the other hand, when griefes and ſorrowes will not ſmother, that lot may be ſanctified in his perſon, and we may have him for a companion, who knoweth the heart of ſuch a one.</p>

                  <p>The ſixth particular recorded, is the conſtruction the Jewes had of Chriſts expreſſed ſympathy: They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his ſorrow, do admire his love to dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and marvel that he who had wrought ſuch wonders, might not alſo have prevented his death. It is moſt probable, that they who admire his love, were theſe Jewes who were beſt affected to Chriſt, though they have not yet beleeved on him, till afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 45. and that they who wonder he had not prevented his dying, are theſe malicious Jewes, who after the miracle, went and informed the Rulers, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. and therefore the firſt ſort are indifinitely named <hi>the Jewes</hi> here, who are called <hi>many,</hi> ver. 45. and the other ſort are, both here, and <hi>ver.</hi> 46. called only <hi>ſome of them,</hi> Or, it may be conceived, that all of them concurring in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at his love to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as a thing they could not deny, the more malicious ſort do adde that cavil and exception.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts love to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a very captivating and raviſhing meditation; for,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48148:120"/>
that which took hold on them, and ſtrikes them with admiration, is, <hi>he loved him,</hi> which was indeed a truth, that Chriſt as he pitied <hi>Mary</hi> and her ſiſter, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected <hi>Lazarus</hi> eſpecially, and therefore burſt forth in ſorrow, through affection to him and them, and through indignation at Satan and ſin, which drew on theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. 2. The fountain of any compaſſion ſhewed by Chriſt to his own in miſery, is not any worth in them, but his own free love; for, his compaſſionate weeping leads them up to his love, as the cauſe thereof. 3. Chriſt thinks no ſhame of his love to his people, but will avow it, and have it known ſometime to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; for, he doth here ſo let it out as they mark it. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. 4. Chriſts ſympathy and compaſſion toward his people, proves his love to them, although they get not viſible out-gates from their troubles; for, upon his weeping, they gather, <hi>he loved him;</hi> his ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and tears prove love, albeit the man died. And indeed, they who get a ſight of Chriſts tender heart, will beleeve his love, whatever his diſpenſations be. 5. Chriſts love and compaſſion is a wonder to them who know him not well; Yea, it is in it ſelfe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſuch as ſee it, will rather admire it, then know how to comprehend it: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>how he loved him!</hi> See <hi>Eph</hi> 3.18, 19. 6. Chriſts love to his own will follow them even to their graves; As here he gives evidence <hi>how he loved him,</hi> when he is lying in his grave. And albeit every Saint do not meet with that proofe of love which <hi>Lazarus</hi> got, in being raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; yet that love reſts upon them, till the general reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts love is readily miſconſtructed, when he is letting it out moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, and it is liker an enemy, then a friend, ſo to do; for, there are here who indirectly carp at his love, and the expreſſions of it, ſince he ſuſtered the man to die. 2. Corrupt men, and the corrupt diſpoſitions of men, will not readily beleeve Chriſts love, unleſſe it appear in ſome evidences and effects deſired by them; for, this is their indirect exception, that he <hi>cauſed not that this man ſhould not have died.</hi> Miſconſtructers of Chriſts love are ordinarily limiters of his love, to be evidenced in ſuch and ſuch particulars. 3. Men may have much knowledge, and yet much malice againſt Chriſt; Yea, knowledge is very dangerous, if it be not ſanctified and ſeaſoned with grace and love; for, theſe men can tell that he <hi>opened the eyes of the blinde,</hi> ch. 9.6. and, it ſeems, are better acquaint with his proceedings then the others, and yet they carp at his love. 4. Chriſt hath given ſuch proofes of his power, as may convince malice it ſelfe, that he can do greateſt things for his people, if it be for their good; for, their reaſoning grants, that he <hi>which opened the eyes of the blind, could have cauſed that this man ſhould not have died.</hi> 5. When malice and prejudice hath ſaid its worſt againſt Chriſts dealing, it will be found, in end, that he is doing better then we could deſire; for, all they could have expected, was, that he ſhould have <hi>cauſed that this man ſhould not have died,</hi> which might have been done, and yet little of Chriſt or his love have been ſeen in it; For, it might have been looked on only as a recovery out of a dangerous diſeaſe. Whereas he is about to do that for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which ſets forth his own glory, and makes his love to him conſpicuous indeed.</p>

                  <p>Unto theſe is premitted, in this verſe, 1. A decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his exerciſe in coming to the grave; <hi>He again groaned in himſelfe;</hi> Partly, out of indignation at their unbeleeving cavils, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. which he digeſted without anſwering. But chiefly, this flowed from his ſympathy and affection, which ſtill continues, and is renewed at the ſight of the grave; And it ſeems alſo that his praying, of which he gives ſo comfortable an account, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. drave him to theſe groans. For his prayers were very ardent, and he had hard exerciſe in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. that he might be a fellow-feeler with all who tread theſe ſteps. 2. There is premitted, a deſcription of the grave, which ſeems to be marked, chiefly, as an introduction to the following command, to take away the ſtone. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Chriſt our Lord was very ſerious in the works of his calling, and could be very ſerious about them, even in the midſt of outward diſtractions; for, in the midſt of all this company, and while he is walking on in the way, he is exerciſed till he <hi>groan</hi> again. 2. Chriſts compaſſion and ſympathy is not an evaniſhing paſſing thing, but will continue toward the needy, till they get their iſſue; for, he ceaſeth not his groaning, but <hi>groaned again,</hi> in ſympathy and prayer, till the work be done. 3. The unbelief of men, when Chriſt is about to do great things, is a grievous burden to him; for, this <hi>groaning again,</hi> relates alſo to their unbelief, who were to be witneſſes of this miracle, as is before marked. See <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.5, 6. 4. Whatever be the deſert of unbelief, yet Chriſt will not alwayes be hindred by it to do good to the needy; But he will bear it as a part of our miſery, and yet go on to his work; for, he <hi>groaned in himſelfe</hi> for it, and ſo cometh to the grave. 5. As de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ordinary burial is in it ſelfe a mercy, and it is a judgement upon the wicked, to want it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.4. and 22.18, 19. So in the way of burial, there is no reſpect to be had to ſuperſtitious conceits, nor yet to pompe and vain glory, but only that the dead be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the ſight of the living, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. and that their bodies be ſecured againſt external violence and injury, as being cloſed upon hope of a reſurrection; Therefore, it is marked of <hi>Lazarus</hi> burial place, that <hi>it was</hi> only <hi>a cave, and a ſtone lay upon it,</hi> that his body might not be violate nor injured.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have the firſt thing which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the grave; to wit, a reproofe of <hi>Martha's</hi> fit of unbelief, when Chriſt begins to prepare for the miracle. He commanding to remove the ſtone, her unbelief objects that it was needleſſe, ſeeing he was ſo long dead, and it would raiſe a noiſome ſmell now to open his grave, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. And he reproves this her unbelief, as being very odious, ſince he had given her a promiſe, that upon her beleeving, ſhe ſhould ſee the glory of God manifeſted in this miracle, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. Albeit we finde not theſe expreſſe words mentioned by Chriſt, yet if we compare his general encouragement, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. with the doctrine he required her to beleeve, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 25, 26. we will finde the ſame in ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 39. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever haſte Chriſt make, to releeve his needy people. Yet he will ſo order his working, as to take leiſure to decipher the hidden unbelief that is in the hearts of any of his; Therefore, when he cometh to the grave, he doth not at firſt raiſe the dead man, but takes time to have the ſtone taken away, that ſo <hi>Martha</hi> (who very probably expected a very ſuddain miracle, or none at all) ſeeing him employ no divine power, but only the help of men, to take away the ſtone, that he may look on a ſtinking body; may diſcover the unbelief of her heart. 2. Chriſts miracles were ſuch, and ſo clear, as all beholders might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truth of them, and that there was no jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in the matter; Therefore, he who could have put away the ſtone, commands them, <hi>Take ye away the ſtone,</hi> to prevent all ſuſpition of colluſion or fraud in this matter. 3. Albeit the Lords people may expect won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful proofes of his power and love, in their need, in ſo far as is for their good; Yet in any diſtreſſe, we are not to expect that, where ordinary means may availe, Chriſt will work wonders and miracles for us; Therefore, albeit he who could raiſe the dead, could have alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the ſtone, yet, ſaith he to ſome about, <hi>Take ye away the ſtone;</hi> For that was a work which men could do, and therefore he will not appear in it; whereas none could raiſe the dead but himſelfe. 4. When Chriſt is about to do good unto and for his people, they are ready to obſtruct their own mercy by unbelief; as <hi>Martha's</hi> example doth teach. 5. In times of great ſtrait, Saints may expect to have frequent and ſore toſſings, and that after their faith is ſettled, they may yet be ſhaken of new; for, <hi>Martha,</hi> whom Chriſt had brought to beleeve after her doubtings, doth now begin to doubt again. 6. Saints who have had their confidence fixed, when impediments are at a diſtance, may yet be in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ſtaggering, when it comes to the puſh, and faith is to grapple with theſe impediments; for, <hi>Martha,</hi> who cloſed her debate with Chriſt by beleeving, doth now doubt again, when the miracle comes to be done, and the grave to be opened. 7. It is a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto faith, and the exerciſe thereof, when either new impediments, not foreſeen, do come in, and make a new battel; or when carnal reaſon bears ſway in the heart, and judgeth of all things according to its diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, both of theſe concurre here in her doubting; She had not thought, in her former conference, of this impediment, and her reaſon ſuggeſts that it was to no purpoſe to meddle with a man who <hi>ſtinketh</hi> in the grave. 8. When the Lord is bringing the difficulties of his people neareſt an end, he may then give unto them moſt humbling diſcoveries of their own unbelief and diſtruſt ever to ſee an iſſue; that ſo he alone may have the glory of bringing it about; for, immediately before the miracle is wrought, <hi>Martha's</hi> unbelief doubts if ever it ſhall be. 9. Such is the frailty and lothſomneſſe of mens bodies, that however they have beauty and vigour while the ſoul poſſeſſeth and acteth them; Yet a few dayes ſeparation of the ſoul by death will alter them ſo, that deareſt friends cannot endure them; Therefore, ſaith ſhe, <hi>By this time he ſtinketh,</hi> and that albeit <hi>he hath been dead</hi> but <hi>foure daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 40. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. God doth ſo order the affairs and conditions of his people, as his glory may be manifeſted in and about them, and this is his chiefe aime and end in all he doth; Therefore doth he deſcribe the miracle from this, as his chiefe end in it, that it is a manifeſtation of <hi>the glory of God.</hi> 2. It is the duty of the Lords people, to be more affected with the glory of God ſhining in his works, then with any particular advantage redounds to them thereby; Therefore, alſo, doth he hold out <hi>the glory of God,</hi> to be ſeen in this miracle, as rather to be taken notice of by her, then the raiſing up of her brother. 3. It may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Gods people to expect the performance of his promiſe, how impoſſible ſo ever it ſeem, that by ſo doing, he will not only do them good, but will get occaſion of ſetting forth his own glory, and that his glory is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do them good; for, this, further is imported in this deſignation of the miracle, as a manifeſtation of <hi>the glory of God,</hi> that ſince his glory is engaged, ſhe needs not be ſo anxious. 4. The way preſcribed by God, wherein Saints may meet with experimental ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his glory, for their good and comfort, is, firſt to give him glory by beleeving him and his Word, the want whereof doth juſtly provoke him not to let forth himſelfe; for, <hi>if thou wouldeſt beleeve, thou ſhould ſee the glory of God.</hi> See <hi>Mark.</hi> 6 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.58. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.20, 45. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.50. 5. Albeit faith for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have many diſadvantages to grapple with, yet the ſweet fruits that will follow upon beleeving, may invite us to beleeve that we may partake of them; for, albeit now the ſtinking body of her brother do marre her faith, yet it pleads ſtrongly for faith, that if in that caſe ſhe will hazard to beleeve, her beleeving ſhall lead her to <hi>ſee the glory of God.</hi> 6. Faiths ground, whereupon it may thus hazard, and expect this fair fruit, is Gods Word, and not carnal reaſon; for, <hi>I ſaid unto thee,</hi> and therefore thou ſhould beleeve to ſee. 7. Where God hath paſt his word, and it is not credited, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ground of ſharp rebuke and chalenge; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Said not I unto thee, if thou wouldeſt beleeve, thou ſhouldeſt ſee?</hi> See <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. 8. Albeit unbelief go masked, oft-times, under a fair ſhew of humility, or the like commendable diſpoſition; Yet, in Chriſts account, it is an evil not to be tolerated, but ſharply reproved, and an evil that would be quickly removed, that it get not leave to take root; Therefore doth he ſo ſharply and ſo ſpeedily rebuke it.</p>

Publickly give him thanks for hearing him in this matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. 2. He gives a reaſon why he publiſhed this thankſgiving, which was not becauſe it was unuſual for him to be heard, who was never refuſed in any ſute, but that theſe who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent might be convinced that he is the Mediatour ſent and approved of the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 42.

                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Unbeliefe in any of the Lords people is not only their own ſin, but when it breaks forth, it is alſo a ſtumbling block to others, in their going on in their duty; for, <hi>Martha's</hi> exception had hindered the men, and, it ſeems, drawn them to doubt with her, <hi>Then</hi> (to wit, when ſhe is reproved and paſſeth from it, and not till then) <hi>they took away the ſtone from the place where the deal was laid.</hi> 2. It is an evidence that the people of God have quit their unbelief, or are not maſtered with it, when they ſilence their reaſonings and exceptions, and do not ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief to impede obedience to commanded duties; for, this is the evidence that <hi>Martha</hi> is ſatisfied, in that ſhe reaſons no more, and in that ſhe puts no new impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hinder the removing of the ſtone, as Chriſt had commanded. 3. Such things as we do earneſtly deſire, we ought to pray ſeriouſly for them to God; As Chriſts practice doth teach us, who had been praying about this miracle, as is here imported. 4. Honeſt and ſincere prayer will aford matter of praiſe; And men need not make much ſhew or noiſe of their ſeeking of God; for, God will openly reward them by publike teſtimonies of his favour, calling for praiſe; for, herein alſo hath our ſurety led the way, who praying in ſecret among the crowd, gets matter of publike praiſe, and hath the fruits of the prayer appearing in the ſubſequent miracle. 5. Sincere ſeekers of God may know that their prayers are heard, albeit the thing ſought be not as yet perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, Chriſt acknowledgeth he is <hi>heard,</hi> although the miracle was not yet wrought. And albeit he knew this in a peculiar way, yet Saints alſo have rules whereby to diſcern this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. 6. Gods hearing of prayer obligeth us to praiſe; And all theſe who know their need, and the mercy of God reſpecting their cry in their need, will not faile to make conſcience of praiſe; for, ſo doth his practice teach us, <hi>I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. 7. As theſe who expect and deſire their prayers to be heard in mercy, ſhould make ſure an intereſt in God, and that they are his children; So Gods hearing of his peoples prayers is a ſweet confirmation of that intereſt, and this ſhould be fed upon with a warm and thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that relation; for, ſo doth Chriſts example teach, who in this thankful account of his Fathers anſwer, expreſſeth this ſweet relation, <hi>Father, I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me,</hi> as indeed he was his Father in a ſpecial manner, and did give ſignal proofes thereof, in hearing him as Mediatour. 8. Chriſts people are ſo dear to him, that not only do their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties call him to prayer for them; But his being heard in their behalfe doth affect and oblige him, as if it were for himſelfe: for, he doth here not only pray, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it matter of praiſe, when he is heard. 9. Such as are rightly employed in ſpiritual duties, their heart and affections will be toward God, and heaven-ward; And theſe affections will carry the outward man with them, in ſo far as is convenient; for, in this thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>Jeſus lift up his eyes,</hi> to teſtifie where his heart was. And albeit in his prayer we finde neither words nor any ſuch ſignes uſed, becauſe it was ſecret; Yet now, in this publike thankſgiving, he will edifie the hearers by this very outward directing of the eye.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is a Mediatour who continueth conſtant in the exerciſe of interceſſion for his own; for, if he be <hi>heard alwaies,</hi> then he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alwayes. 2. Such is the conformity betwixt the Father and the Mediatours will, and ſo ſtrictly hath the Father obliged himſelfe to his Son, undertaking that office, that all he prayes for is granted; for, <hi>Thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> 3. It is a ſpecial favour not only to be heard of God, but to know and be ſatisfied that it is ſo; that we be not cruſhed under miſtakes; Therefore Chriſt publiſheth it as a part of that favour to him as Mediatour, <hi>I know that thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.15. 4. It concerneth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, to underſtand well how great acceptance Chriſt hath with the Father, that ſo it may deterre them from coming in oppoſition to him, and may invite them to employ him who cometh ſuch ſpeed in their affairs; for, this was his end in publiſhing this his ſucceſſe, not only to lay before them a pattern of duty in the like
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48148:121"/>
caſes, as is marked on <hi>ver.</hi> 41. But chiefly, that he may be known, <hi>But becauſe of the people that ſtand by, I ſaid it, that they may beleeve.</hi> 5. We do then take up Chriſt comfortably, when not only we ſee his own affection and reſpect to us, but when we ſee him one with the Father, and his Ambaſſadour, and that the Father is well pleaſed, and to be found in him; for, this is it he would have gathered from his acceptance in prayer, <hi>That they may beleeve that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> And for this cauſe, he chooſeth rather to take this way, then only to manifeſt his own power in this.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have the ſecond part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, containing the miracle it ſelfe, which is ſhortly done. For Chriſt calling on the dead man, as if he were alive, to come forth, he cometh out in the ſame poſture wherein he was laid in his grave. And Chriſt requires ſome to looſe him, that ſo they might be further confirmed of the truth of the miracle. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The upſhot and cloſe of Chriſts dealing will richly compence all his delayes, and ſeeming harſh dealing; for, the iſſue of all this procedure, in the former part of the Chapter, is, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> is raiſed again. 2. Albeit Chriſt may, in his peoples trouble, take much time to exerciſe and prepare them for mercy, and to let out proofes of his compaſſion and ſympathy; Yet when that is done, he can give an iſſue, and help them, in a moment; for, now when all theſe are over here, the miracle is preſently diſpatched. <hi>And when he had thus ſpoken,</hi> and tried diſciples and friends, removed their unbelief; manifeſted his own affectionate heart, &amp;c. <hi>he cried,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Chriſts word of command, whereby the world was created, and is upheld, is ſufficient to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate greateſt things, if it were even to raiſe the dead; for, he did no more, in bringing about this miracle, but <hi>cried,</hi> &amp;c. 4. His <hi>crying with a loud voice,</hi> in the audience of all, was not only an evidence of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and that, as he employed the Father, ſo alſo, he put forth his own power in this miracle; But further, it points out. 1. His affection and earneſtneſſe to have the thing done, and ſheweth, That Chriſt is not a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driffe friend, but takes a hearty lift in what concerns his people. 2. It points out his confidence in the matter, and therefore he publikely interpriſeth it in the hearing of all. To teach, that whatever our unbeleeving hearts ſay, yet Chriſt is not afraid of his work, that it ſhall miſcarry in his hand. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 5. Chriſt, in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his omnipotency, doth not look on things as they are in themſelves, or ſeem to be unto us; But he calleth theſe things that are not, as though they were, and in ſpeaking to, and commanding the powerleſſe and dead, he giveth them life and ſtrength to obey; for, <hi>he cryed, Lazarus come forth.</hi> His omnipotency ſpeaks to him, as to one living, and ready to come forth on a call, becauſe at this very word, he put life in him to hear and obey. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. 6. Chriſt hath our life in his hand, to take it away, or reſtore it, at his pleaſure; and when he calls even for the dead, they will obey him; for, <hi>and he that was dead came forth.</hi> 7. Whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments men have within time, yet it is but little of theſe things they can take away with them; for, it is marked, that he came out <hi>bound with grave-cloathes, and his face bound about with a napkin.</hi> Not ſo much to point out a new miracle in the boſome of the other, that a dead man ſhould not only come out, but come out ſo bound as might hinder one to walk; for, it may eaſily be conceived, that the bonds were ſo looſe, as he might creep one way or other out, and he knew the place better then to go wrong, though his face was covered.

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have the firſt conſequent of the miracle, which is, the diverſe impreſſions it takes upon the Jewes who were preſent: Many of them beleeving, and others of them perſiſting in unbelief, and not being able to do unto Chriſt what they would, themſelves, they delate the matter to the Phariſees. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt doth not ſpread his net by doctrine and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48148:122"/>
but for ſome notable fruit and effect: for, here by raiſing up of one dead body, he raiſeth up many dead ſouls 2. Albeit, for the moſt part, they generally are naught; yet at ſome times, and in ſome ſocieties, it pleaſeth him to work upon, and gain the far greater part; for, <hi>Many of the Jewes beleeved,</hi> whereas <hi>ſome</hi> only, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. do perſiſt in their ill courſe. 3. Such as come to do good unto the godly in their need, may readily meet with more good to themſelves by the means; for, <hi>they came to Mary,</hi> who finde Chriſt, and are drawn to beleeve. It is ſaid they came to <hi>Mary</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they came out to the grave after her, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. Or, becauſe, however they came out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to comfort both her and <hi>Martha,</hi> ver. 19. yet they did it chiefly for <hi>Maries</hi> ſake. 4. Such as do rightly conſider of Chriſts glorious workings and manifeſtations unto, and for his people, may be abundantly convinced that he is the true Meſſiah, and ſee convincing grounds wherefore they ſhould embrace and cloſe with him by faith; for, <hi>when they had ſeen the things which Jeſus did</hi> (not only the miracle, for that alone could not work ſolid faith, though it might prepare for it, but his groaning, weeping doctrine, thankſgiving, the way of the miracle &amp;c.) they <hi>beleeved on him.</hi> 5. When Chriſt is prevailing faſteſt, yet his doctrine and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will never be well taken at all hands; for, <hi>ſome of them,</hi> are of another temper. 6. Not only the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example of many will not work upon the obſtinate; But their (other wayes) good and moral principles will not contribute to draw them to Chriſt; for, not only ſtand they out, being a few, when many yeeld, but though they had compaſſion to let out for a godly <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> yet they will not embrace Chriſt. 7. The moſt glorious actings of Chriſt will be ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with the obſtinate, that they will rather become the worſe of them; for, what greater act could there be then what Chriſt did here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet they are enraged, and make it a dittay againſt him. 8. Albeit wicked men may pretend many prejudices againſt Chriſt and his dealing, wherefore they cannot embrace him; Yet when all theſe are removed, they will be nothing the better; for, it was their great exception againſt Chriſts love to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he had not prevented his death, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. Yet when that is removed in a glorious way, they are not gained. 9. Albeit many who maligne Chriſt, have but ſmall power to hurt him, yet were their hornes never ſo ſhort, they will have them out againſt him; for, they cannot hurt Chriſt themſelves, but they will ſet others on work to do it. 10. Such as are prime agents againſt Chriſt, he will plague them with much employment of that kinde, to fill up their cup; for, <hi>the Phariſees</hi> muſt be told, that may appear in this buſineſſe. 11. Such as do inſtigate and ſtir up others to perſecute, or do delate the godly to their malicious enemies, are in effect cruel perſecutors; for, it is marked, as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their malicious diſpoſition, that they <hi>went to the Phariſees, and told them what things Jeſus had done.</hi> 12. Chriſt can make uſe even of the malice of his enemies, to make them publiſhers of his glory and praiſe; for, their malice led them to <hi>tell the Phariſees what things Jeſus had done,</hi> and ſo there was no need of his friends to publiſh and confirme the truth of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond conſequent of the miracle, is the carriage of the Rulers: being exaſperated upon this information. It contains foure particulars, The firſt whereof (in theſe verſes) is their conveening in council, and conſulting upon the matter; Wherein, they propound the caſe; that Chriſt did many miracles; and the danger that would enſue, if they took no courſe with him; that Chriſt being ſo popular, by reaſon of his miracles, will draw the people after him, and hereby will incenſe the <hi>Romans,</hi> and make them deſtroy the Temple and their Nation, ſeeing the people will be ready to move ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to cry up Chriſt as a King of <hi>Davids</hi> progeny. And therefore they wonder at one another that they do nothing in the matter, and enquire at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what to do.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 47. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts enemies are very ready to receive delations againſt him, and the more they ſee or hear that his glory ſhines, they grow the worſe; for, when this is delated, they are in a rage. 2. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee authority and power againſt Chriſt; And to ſee even Churchmen in the judicatories appointed by him, plotting the ruine of him and his Kingdome; for, <hi>the chiefe Prieſts and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees gathered a counſel,</hi> (the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of old appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God) that they may deviſe means to deſtroy him. By this the Lord would diſcover, that there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in men or judicatories; and would teach, that he can carry on his work, albeit authority and judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories be againſt him; and that he oft-times doth ſo, that he alone may have the glory; whereas, otherwiſe, too much would be given to men. Theſe who met, or, at leaſt, gathered and conveened the council, are called <hi>the chiefe Prieſts,</hi> not only the High Prieſt and his deputy, or poſſibly alſo theſe who by courſes ſucceeded in the High-Prieſthood in that time of corruption, wherein that office was expoſed to ſale, as Hiſtories do record. But it comprehends alſo the heads of the twenty four orders of Prieſts inſtitute by <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 24. To theſe are joined <hi>the Phariſees,</hi> which was the name of a Sect among them; And they are named, not becauſe none of theſe Preiſts were of that Sect, but to ſhew that other Phariſees who had place in the council did moſt frequently conveene, as being moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt. 3. Wicked perſecutors are ordinarily ſo far from repenting their cruelty, that they are angry they are ſo ſlow, and not more violent; for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their former violence againſt Chriſt, yet, <hi>what do we?</hi> ſay they, or, are we ſleeping? 4 The Lords power and wiſdome are ſo eminently employed about Chriſt, his truth and people, that when perſecutors have done their utmoſt, they will finde they have made
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48148:122"/>
ſmall progreſſe, as to gaining of their purpoſe; for, this, <hi>what do we?</hi> imports alſo, that however they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him all along, had traduced him and his Miniſtry, baniſhed him, endeavoured to enſnare him, ſought to take him &amp;c. yet in effect they had promoved nothing, as to hindering of him in his Miniſtry, or the ſucceſſe thereof. And it will be thus ſtill, even when they go a further length. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. 5. Albeit the wits of men may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt and his people do ſay, and give out to the world; yet many of them may be, and are inwardly convinced in their conſciences, that theſe whom they perſecute, are innocent and doets of good; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their many cavillations in publike, againſt Chriſt and his miracles, yet here in their Cabin-council they are forced to acknowledge, <hi>he doth many miracles,</hi> and they have no evil to ſay of him.

                     </gap>o <hi>Act.</hi> 4 16. Chriſt was indeed thus innocent, and all Chriſtians ought to ſtudy it, as being a great advantage to have ſuch a teſtimony in the boſome of enemies, whatever effect it take. 7. Whatever be the innocency of Chriſt and his followers, or the convictions of bloody perſecutors; Yet ordinarily they take little effect, they neither heighten their eſtimation of the innocent, nor abate their rage againſt them; for, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, yet he is but <hi>this man,</hi> by way of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt, and they go on in their bloody reſolutions againſt him.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver</hi> 48. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begins to flouriſh in any meaſure, it is to be expected, that carnal men, and eſpecially corrupt Church men will raiſe a fire of perſecution, as the only remedy they know to blaſt it; for, ſay they, <hi>If we let him thus alone</hi> all will go to ruine, and therefore they muſt perſecute. 2 When Chriſts enemies are pleaſed to ſpeak out their mindes plainly, it will be found that their intereſts and worldly ſtate is their great Idol, and that which drives them to perſecute Chriſt; for, this is their fear it ſubſtance, that they will loſe their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the peoples leaving them, and following of him, and that if their Nation ruine, their power will be gone. 3. Perſecutors do look on Chriſts ſucceſſe with an envious eye, and in a multiplying glaſſe, that ſo it may whet their malice againſt him; for, when ſome few have beleeved, they take them up as ſo many, that if he continue a while, <hi>all men will beleeve on him,</hi> in which, experience proved there was but too little truth. 4. Whatever be the real Idols and Intereſts of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; Yet they will labour to cover them with pretences of publike good and ſafety; for, albeit their own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and places ſweyed moſt with them, yet they give out this for their colour, <hi>The Romans ſhall take away bath our place,</hi> (the Temple that is dear to us, as what is our own) <hi>and Nation.</hi> 5. It is the uſual policy of Perſecutors, to decline, by all means, to oppoſe Chriſt in his Kingdome as Chriſt, and truth as truth; But they labour to colour the quarrel with ſome ſpecious pretences, that ſo they may hide the odiouſneſſe of their courſe from others, and blinde their own eyes, that they may not ſee they are fighting againſt God; for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His doctrine allowed of no ſedition, nor did he claime to a worldly Kingdome; the receiving of him, by whom Kings reign, is the way to uphold States and Nations; and, any calamities that follow upon the Goſpel, are not the fruits of the Goſpel, but of mens own ſins, who make not uſe of ſuch a jewel. And on the other hand, it is their unjuſtice, that they will not conſult what is right or wrong, dutie or ſinne, in this matter, but what is profitable or hurtful; and, that they will not admit of Chriſt, if he contribute not to their ſtanding. Whereas, though the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have deſtroyed them upon that account, yet what was that, if it were their duty, and they were in the way of God? 8. Such as bend their wits to finde out indirect and ſinful courſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may avoid feared trouble, and eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is righteous with God, to make theſe ſame courſes bring their fear upon them; And particularly, they who ſeek to eſtabliſh their own eſtate and power by the overthrow of Chriſts Kingdome, do take the compendious way to eſtabliſh his Kingdome, and overthrow their own; for, they know no way to ſuppreſſe Chriſt, and ſave themſelves from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but to perſecute him; and in the iſſue this advanced Chriſts intereſt, and in Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, drew the <hi>Romans</hi> upon them ſome few years thereafter.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, in the carriage of theſe Rulers, we have recorded what was <hi>Cajaphas</hi> his over ture for preventing this danger. He propounds, very imperiouſly, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of policy, that in a caſe of danger, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient one ſhould be cut off for the good of a Nation, rather then the whole Nation periſh. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was to be cut off, that ſo the Nation might be freed of that hazard. This counſel and principle (beſide what God intended in it, of which afterward) may have it's own truth in it; That in the caſe of danger to a Nation or ſociety, one is bound to preferre the ſafety of the whole to his own particular ſafety; or, That juſtice is to be executed on a particular male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, leſt the neglect thereof make his ſin National, and bring judgements on a Land: But this doth not at all juſtifie the putting of an innocent to death, for the ſafety of any; for that were to ſinne to avoid trouble. Far leſſe doth it juſtifie it, when men do hereby not only cut off the innocent, but do not avoid, but, in effect, draw on ruine on the Nation. He who gave the counſel is deſcribed from his office, that he was <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> of which uſe is to be made in the following purpoſe. Only what is added (that he was <hi>the high Prieſt that ſame year</hi>) points at the corruption crept in among them (as is recorded in Hiſtory) in theſe latter times, in that the office which by Gods appointment was aſtricted to the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to continue during life, was either uſurped by theſe who had moſt power, extending the poſſeſſours, and held ſo long as they could: Or was purchaſed by favour, or money, of their conquerours, for ſo long time as pleaſed them, or they did agree upon. Their own ambition begot theſe practices under the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that, together with <hi>Herods</hi> policies, and afterward the avarice of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> did continue them. And he is ſaid to have been only for <hi>that ſame year,</hi> becauſe it had been the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> immediately before his election, to change them yearly; and however ſome might continue longer, yet it ſeems the paction was but from year to year. As to what further may be ſaid concerning his office, and <hi>Annas</hi> being joyned with him before, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.2 it may be ſpoken to, if need be, on <hi>Chap</hi> 18.13. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. As the moſt pure Ordinances of God are eaſily corrupted by lewd men. So, in particular, the ambition of men, taking advantage of times of publike confuſion and oppreſſion, doth oft-times overturn the precious Government and order of his houſe; while either they do what they liſt and is in the power of their hand, or employ their power with oppreſſours, to make merchandize of the things of God; for, thus and upon theſe grounds, was the Ordinance of the Prieſthood corrupted, while men either uſurped it, or did ſerve the intereſts of, or gave money to their conquerours, to obtain it. 2. As mens wiſdome, or their conceit of it, doth ordinarily fill them with pride and contempt of others; So ſuch wit will readily never do well, nor lead men on right courſes; for, he gives his opinion inſulting over the reſt, as <hi>knowing nothing at all, nor conſidering,</hi> when yet his wit led him only to crucifie Chriſt. 3. Such as corrupt the Ordinances of God, and take ſinful courſes to put themſelves in power in Gods houſe, will prove but ſmall friends to Chriſt and his Kingdome, whatever they ſeem otherwiſe to be; for, it was he who procured himſelfe to be <hi>the High Prieſt that ſame year,</hi> that gave this pernicious counſel againſt Chriſt. 4. Albeit it be the duty of all, to preferre the publike welfare of a Church or Nation to their own ſafety or intereſts; Yet it is unlawful to promote, never ſo publike a good, by ſinful means; for, herein did his opinion prove unſound, in ſeeking to prevent the <hi>periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nation.</hi> 5. It is a ſinful principle in worldly policy, to ſtudy to preſerve the peace of a Nation by cutting off theſe who promote the Kingdome of Chriſt; for, this, in particular, was the ſin of his counſel, that albeit they had nothing to ſay againſt Chriſt, yet better he periſh, were he never ſo good or right, then things ſhould be in hazard. Whereas, albeit this might have indeed preſerved them, yet it was not a lawful mean. 6. Mens wit will never lead them right, ſo long as they ſeparate profit and expedience, from lawfulneſſe and right, and do preferre the one before the other; for, in all this he looks only to what is <hi>expedient for us.</hi> 7. The rareſt wits of men, when they are left of God, and do make no conſcience of ſin to compaſſe their deſignes, will but miſcarry, and run upon the dangers they labour moſt carefully to avoid; for, though this ſeemed moſt <hi>expedient,</hi> and a ſhort cut to be rid of Chriſt and ſecure the Nation, yet neither ſucceeded with them; Chriſt and his doctrine prevailed ſtill among them, and their Nation did periſh.</p>

                  <p>In the third place, before the acceptation of this overture be recorded, <hi>John</hi> doth interlace ſome remarke upon this opinion, Wherein, 1.

It is clear enough that he purpoſed nothing elſe, but to put Chriſt out of the way, that there might be no occaſion for the <hi>Romans</hi> to fall upon the Nation. But the meaning is, that in giving his wicked counſel, to procure the ſafety of his Nation from the <hi>Romans</hi> by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48148:123"/>
putting Chriſt to death; God over-ruled his tongue to bring out an Oracle, concerning his purpoſe to ſave his people by the death of Chriſt. 2. <hi>John</hi> enlargeth this prophecy which <hi>Cajaphas</hi> uttered unawares, <hi>ver.</hi> 52. ſhewing that, in Gods purpoſe, the benefits of Chriſts death were to be extended further then to the Nation of the Jewes only, even to all the elect, ſcattered through the world. It is further to be conſidered, that <hi>Johns</hi> ſaying, <hi>being high Prieſt, he propheſied,</hi> &amp;c. doth make nothing at all for their opinion who aſſert the infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and aſſiſtance of the Spirit with Popes, even albeit they be wicked men, ſuch as <hi>Cajaphas</hi> was, who yet being high Prieſt, did propheſie concerning the death of Chriſt. For, 1. They have not yet proven from Scripture, that their Popes have that warrand for their office, nor any of theſe diverſe priviledges which the high Prieſt of the Jewes had. 2. The high Prieſts of the Jewes, even when they obſerved Gods order in coming to it, albeit ſometimes ſome of them did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and for a time they had the extraordinary gift of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> yet they fell in groſſe errours; <hi>Aaron</hi> made the golden calfe, <hi>Urijah</hi> brought in an altar after the pattern of that in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.10, 11. 3. Since this man came not in an orderly way to his office, if they will argue from this, it will follow that not only their Popes whom they account to be lawfully choſen, but even their Anti-popes, whom they condemne, muſt have the ſame priviledge of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. 4. Such a prophecy as this doth indeed very well beſeem them who ſit in the Temple of God as gods, and yet are bitter enemies to Chriſt and his truth. For he did not intentionally bring forth any thing for Chriſts advantage, only God over-ruled his tongue in venting his wicked malice, that he ſhould propound this Oracle. 5. His being high Prieſt, is added, not as a reaſon why he did propheſie (though ſome of them of old might have had revelations, and God may when he pleaſeth, even employ a wicked man that way) but to ſhew that, becauſe of his authority and place, which would readily incline the reſt to follow him, therefore God over ruled his tongue, that he ſhould bring forth no overture concerning Chriſt, but what was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his purpoſe in ſending his Sonne into the world.</p>
                  <p>From theſe verſes <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Gods over-ruling hand can ſecure, that in the conſultations of men, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be concluded concerning Chriſt or his Church, but what he hath appointed to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, ſo did he over-rule this conſultation, and <hi>Cajaphas</hi> his overture. See <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. 2. The more power and ſway any wicked men have, the more we are bound to beleeve that the overruling hand and providence of God will ſet bound and limits to their conſultations and concluſions, for the good of his Church; for, whereas it might be little regarded what others might ſay, whoſe opinions were of leſſe weight, yet when the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> begins to ſpeak, God overrules it, that he ſhall <hi>propheſie,</hi> and utter an Oracle. 3. In beleeving Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence watching for his peoples good, we are not to look to the intentions of men, nor to their malicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; But we ought to beleeve that, even in theſe, God overrules them to do nothing, but what is for good; for, he knew not that he was propheſieing, nor intended any ſuch thing, but was letting out the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his malice againſt Chriſt, and yet even then <hi>he propheſied;</hi> God overruled his malicious counſel, that his purpoſe ſhould be carried on thereby, and his tongue in uttering thereof, that it ſhould be, in effect, an Oracle. 4. The Nation of the Jewes, as they had the firſt offer of the death of Chriſt, and of the benefits flowing therefrom; ſo they have a ſpecial intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to be manifeſted in due time; for, it is an Oracle, <hi>that Jeſus ſhould die for that Nation,</hi> that is, his own in it. 5. Whatever be the intereſt of the Jewes in the Meſſiah and his ſufferings; Yet Gods intentions in giving him to die, and the fruits of his death, do extend further then to that Nation; for, ſo doth <hi>John</hi> guard this, <hi>and not for that Nation only.</hi> And by his correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, he intimates how ſweet the calling of the Gentiles was to him, and therefore he will not have it omitted; and how ſweet the death of Chriſt and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits hereof were in his account, that he will not ſuffer that <hi>Cajaphas</hi> ſhould ſpeak thereof too diſadvantageouſly, without correcting of him. 6. Albeit Chriſts death, and the benefits thereof, be extended to all Nations, yet not to all and every one in theſe Nations, but only to his own elect; for, they are <hi>the children of God</hi> only, for whom he dies. 7. Such as Chriſt hath died for, are by nature and in themſelves, in as bad a condition as any, being ſcattered and ſeparated from God and Chriſt, and from the Church, and one from another; for, they are <hi>ſcattered abroad,</hi> not ſo much in reſpect of place (though that was true alſo) for there is no <hi>gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them into one place; as in reſpect of their ſtate and condition, whereof their being Gentiles, ſcattered up and down the world, was a badge and evidence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. 8. Whatever be the ſtate and condition of Gods elect before converſion; Yet in reſpect of his decree and purpoſe, they are his children; As here they are called <hi>the children of God.</hi> 9. Such as are elected and redeemed by Chriſt, will be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought near into the ſociety of the Church, if they have been Pagans by ſtate, and gathered together with all the reſt of his people in one head, that ſo they may make up one body; for, <hi>he ſhall gather together in one the children of God.</hi> 10. As Chriſt is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of Redemption for his elect, ſo he is the applier of his own purchaſe; and he who actually converts and brings them to enjoy the benefites of his death; for, it is <hi>he</hi> who <hi>ſhall gather them together in one.</hi>

Chriſts enemies, in their moſt ſecret conſultations, will not get a ſtroak ſtollen on him, but he knows all their projects and concluſions, and how to order his affairs accordingly; for, his fleeing on that ground evidenceth that he was not ignorant of it, <hi>Jeſus therefore walked no more openly.</hi> 2.

As it is lawful for Chriſts ſervants to flee, when their death is decreed by enemies, and the perſecution is perſonal; So they are not to take it ill, if they be often and many times put to hard ſhifts, for their own preſervation; for, after that Chriſt hath been forced oft-times to withdraw before, he is yet put to it again. 4.

                  <p>In the laſt conſequent of this miracle, is recorded, what was the diligence of the Rulers, to have their concluſions executed at the enſuing feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. The order of the purpoſe ſeems to be this; The Rulers had given a charge to the people, eſpecially the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſpy out if they could finde where Chriſt were, that ſo they might take him, <hi>ver.</hi> 57. In obedience to which, when the people are flocking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for preparation to the feaſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 55. they begin to enquire for him, and to reaſon among themſelves, doubting whether he would come or not, <hi>ver</hi> 56. Or it comes all to one purpoſe, to conceive the matter thus; That the Rulers and their Emiſſaries ſeeking him, and not finding him themſelves, they give a charge to all the people, that they ſhould give notice, when ever they knew where he were. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever ſhelter Chriſt or his followers finde, for a time, in the uſe of lawful means; Yet in troublous dayes, they are to ſubmit if it do not continue long, but that at laſt they muſt be brought on the ſtage; Therefore it is marked that <hi>the Jewes Paſſeover was nigh at hand,</hi> to intimate that Chriſt got not leave to lurk long in that place he retired unto. 2. As for this going up to <hi>purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Paſſeover,</hi> albeit the Jewes in theſe times were very ſuperſtitious; Yet it is not clear that this was a practice of their own deviſing; For, we finde that ordinary preparation was requiſite for ſacrifices, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. and particularly for the paſſeover, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in purging leaven out of their houſes, to which the Apoſtle alludes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8.

And it appears theſe who went up, did it becauſe of ſome ſpecial pollution, becauſe of which they behoved to offer ſacrifices (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. and 5. and 6. Chapters, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. and 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.— 16.) which could be offered only at the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and therefore it is ſaid <hi>many,</hi> not <hi>all, went up.</hi> And it teacheth, That as preparation is required for all the ſolemne ſervice of God, ſo in ſpecial for participation of the Lords table; and more particularly, when men are lying under ſome notable pollution. 3 The godly can be no more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for Chriſt and his company, then the wicked are to have his blood; for, as the godly at ſuch a ſolemnity would be ready to ſeek him, as thinking a feaſt, a poore feaſt, if he were not there; and as their affection to have him would readily be ſolicitous, and doubtful whether he will come or not; So it is with theſe blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty men; <hi>They ſought for Jeſus, and,</hi> not finding him, <hi>ſpake among themſelves, what think ye, &amp;c?</hi> 4. Whatever ſucceſſe God permit eager and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty perſecuters to get; Yet they ſhall not want
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48148:124"/>
their own anxieties and vexations, in getting their will; for, ſay they, <hi>What think ye, that he will not come to the feaſt?</hi> The root of which expreſſion, was, their anxietie and doubtfulneſſe if he would come at all. And albeit he did come, and they got him crucified, yet the Lord will plague them with this vexation for a time. 5. Perſecutors are unwilling to have their anxieties known, but they will labour to palliate them with faireſt ſhewes; Yea, and even to make uſe of a cloak of pietie, to carry on their wicked purpoſes; for, ſo much alſo doth this ſpeech import. They are anxious that he will not come that they may take him; But they vent it in tearmes of ſpite againſt him, who pretending to ſo much piety, yet will not come to that ſolemne feaſt. They will traduce him if he come not, and yet all their end in deſiring him, is, that they may ſhed his blood. 6. When Rulers are corrupt, they do much miſchiefe, and ſet a people on work againſt Chriſt; As here we ſee in their <hi>commandement.</hi> 7. Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers muſt reſolve not only on open enemies and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in crying times, but on ſecret ſpies and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, to enſnare and betray them; for, here they are ſet on work to finde him out and delate him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>that they might take him.</hi> 8. Men, ſinning againſt conſcience in a courſe, are very eager and violent leſt it ſhould miſcarry, and they can never be ſure enough of their plots; for, this, among others, was one cauſe of their vigilancy. They ſinned maliciouſly againſt light, and they cannot do too much to prevent a diſappointment. So, when <hi>Judas</hi> turnes a traitour, he fears nothing ſo much as that he ſhould vent his malice, and yet Chriſt ſhould eſcape, and therefore be chargeth the ſouldiers to <hi>hold him faſt,</hi> Matth. 26.48. and to <hi>lead him away ſafely, Mark.</hi> 14 44.</p>

Albeit men are bound, by all lawful means, to preſerve themſelves from the unjuſt violence of perſecutors; Yet when Gods time and calling cometh, and when men ſee it is the will of God they ſhould ſuffer, they ought to ſet their faces to it chearfully; for, whereas before Chriſt withdrew, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.54. Now when <hi>the Paſſeover,</hi> the time of his ſuffering, draweth nigh, he comes to view again, and draws toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> See <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Luk</hi> 9 51. 2. He came ſo long before the time to <hi>Bethany,</hi> where <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others were; Not only that he might ſtay there, and give an occaſion to <hi>Judas</hi> to go his way to the Rulers; or to attend till he peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hearing he was there, might meet him in a ſolemne manner, and he might be conveighed in ſtate to the place of his ſufferings, of which afterward. But his end, more eſpecially, in this was to refreſh and confirme his friends there with his company, before he ſhould be taken from them, and to refreſh himſelfe alſo before he went to his trials. And ſo it teacheth. 1. Where Chriſt hath love, and an intereſt, he will not ſtay long away; for, here after his retirement, he returns to <hi>Bethany.</hi> 2. When ſtormes are ariſing, Chriſt will not forget his own, to give them a viſite, ſooner or later, to fortifie them againſt them; for, <hi>ſix dayes before the Paſſeover,</hi> at which he was to ſuffer, he comes to <hi>Bethany,</hi> to refreſh and confirme his friends by his company, and by warning them of his ſuffering, as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 3. It is a very refreſhful cordial under ſufferings, to have the company and ſociety of godly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48148:125"/>
friends with whom we may converſe at any time; for, Chriſt alſo ſubjected himſelfe to make uſe of this; And as he ſeeks it in the Garden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38, 40. ſo here he ſeeks it in <hi>Bethany.</hi> See how <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemes of a viſite in his bonds, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Where Chriſt converſeth with his people, he will make a place famous by eminent proofes of his power and love for them; for, now the former deſcription of <hi>Bethany,</hi> Chap. 11.1. is laid aſide, and it is moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous that <hi>Lazarus was there, which had been dead, whom he raiſed from the dead.</hi>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have Chriſts entertainment at <hi>Bethany;</hi> A ſupper is made for him, at which <hi>Martha</hi> ſerved, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſate with him, but <hi>Mary</hi> anoints Chriſt with precious ointments. This ſupper was made for him in the houſe of one <hi>Simon a leper,</hi> (who, it ſeems, had been cured by Chriſt) as may be gathered from, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.6, 7. where <hi>Maries</hi> deed is recorded, but her name ſuppreſſed, and it ſeems <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his ſiſters have been invited alſo. As for this practice of <hi>Mary,</hi> I ſhall leave what was extraordinary in it, till it's own place, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Only, it being the cuſtome in theſe countries to anoint their gueſts, and waſh their feet at feaſts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.44, 46. ſhe, out of her great love, will do it with great charge and expence. And whereas here it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe anointed his feet,</hi> and the reſt ſay it was his head, <hi>Matth</hi> 26.7. we are to underſtand that ſhe did anoint both, though ſhe only wiped his feet: and breaking the boxe and powring it on his head, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.3. it ſeems the copiouſneſſe thereof made it run from his head to his feet. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. As temporal things are due unto Chriſt and his Miniſters, who ſow ſpiritual things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. So they who have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of his bounty, will make him very welcome; for, <hi>there they made him a ſupper.</hi> 2. Albeit it be the great ſin of men to pamper their own bodies, and make proviſion for the fleſh; Yet it is not unlawful, at ſome times to enjoy the liberal uſe of the creatures, in a ſober manner; for, Chriſt doth not decline this <hi>ſupper.</hi> Sometimes he went into the feaſts of Phariſees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.36. ſometime with Publicans, <hi>Matth</hi> 9.10. &amp;c. and 11.19. not for their ſare, but that he might gain them; as love is a very gaining way. And here he feaſts with his friends that they may be refreſhed together. 3. As for <hi>Martha's</hi> ſerving, albeit ſhe was reproved for this at another time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.38, 39, 40, 41, 42. not ſimply for her ſerving Chriſt that way, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and when it croſſed better duties; Yet now when it interrupts no better duty, her care was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, that ſhe would ſerve, though the houſe was not her own. And it teacheth, That when Chriſt is dear to any, they will not diſdain to ſtoop to do meaneſt ſervice to him, or his for his ſake; as <hi>Martha ſerved</hi> here. 4. As Chriſts miracles are true and real, and not lying wonders; So the memory of his wonderful works are not to be forgotten, nor ought to wear out with length of time; for, both theſe ends it is marked, that <hi>Lazarus was one of them that ſate at table with him,</hi> both to confirme the truth of his reſurrection, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.43. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.41, 42, 43. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.41. and to keep us in minde of that wonderful work, that he who was once in his grave ſhould now be eating. 5. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as men abound in love to Chriſt, they will bring forth evidences thereof, in ſerving of him; As here <hi>Mary</hi> outſtrips them all. 6. Love to Chriſt is ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to finde out a way to evidence it ſelfe; and when all are buſie, it will finde ſome work that is undone, to be done to him and for him; for, when ſome are prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupper, <hi>Martha</hi> is ſerving, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him at Table, <hi>Mary</hi> findes out this, to anoint his feet. 7. Love is very prodigal (ſo to ſay) and will ſpare no expences on Chriſt; for, ſhe took <hi>a pound of very coſtly Spikenard</hi> to do this, of the worth whereof, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 8. True love is ſtill accompanied with humility and reverence to Chriſt, and when it doth moſt to Chriſt, it keeps a man ſtill humble; for, when ſhe had done all this, <hi>ſhe wiped his feet with her haire,</hi> either to make them clean before the ointment came upon them, or to wipe off the ointment after it had ſuppled his feet. 9. As the fruits of love will not hide, ſo they have a fragrant ſmell; for, ſo much may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by alluſion from this, that <hi>the houſe was filled with the odour of the ointment,</hi> and ſo the matter came to be known, which occaſioned the ſubſequent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, is recorded a conſequent of this practice of <hi>Mary;</hi> namely <hi>Judas</hi> his quarrelling of it, which alſo was an occaſion of his going and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his Maſter, as the other Evangeliſts mark, Albeit the other Evangeliſts lay this upon all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, becauſe, in appearance, they conſented to him and ſeconded him in ſo plauſible a cauſe; Yet <hi>John</hi> declareth it was he who raiſed the debate, and under a pretence of caring for the poor, condemned this practice as a needleſſe waſte. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Very groſſe hypocrites may be near to Chriſt in outward profeſſion, and may be entruſted in eminent employments; for, <hi>Judas Iſcariot, Simons ſon, which ſhould betray him,</hi> is <hi>one of his Diſciples.</hi> 2. Such as follow Chriſt on unſound tearmes, and will forſake and betray him in a ſtrait, will be now and then bewraying their unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before hand, if they be well obſerved; for, he <hi>which ſhould betray him,</hi> brings out his covetouſneſſe here before hand. 3. It is the great and woful art of hypocrites, that they mask their corrupt intentions with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48148:125"/>
fair pretences, and that they deſire to lurk ſo long as they can; for, all his language is, <hi>why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poore?</hi> This whole ſumme, after the Engliſh account, amounts (according to the opinion of ſome concerning the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man penny</hi>) to nine pounds, ſeven ſhillings, ſix pence; O: (according to others) to eight pounds, ſix ſhillings, eight pence. And as this points out the great liberality of <hi>Mary</hi> in this her practice; So <hi>Judas,</hi> by his mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, inſinuates that it was altogether needleſſe to beſtow ſo much on ſuch a peece of ſervice to Chriſt; As indeed, men are ready to account it great <hi>waſte</hi> (as the word is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 8.) when a little is beſtowed on Chriſt and his ſervice, when yet they can waſte more needleſly, in ſerving their luſts, without noiſe or grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this wanted not a fair pretence, that Chriſt cared for no ſuch coſtly anointing, and that it did not beſeeme their low eſtate. And withal, his great covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is masked with a pretence of care for the poor. It is very dangerous to live in times, when cloaks of faults are as rife as the faults themſelves. 4. It is the will of God, that the poore be taken notice of, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by every one, according to their ability; for, ſo much appeares in Chriſts practice, who in his deep poverty, did lay up ſomewhat for them, as <hi>Judas</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception imports. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.29.</p>

                  <p>Before <hi>John</hi> ſet down Chriſts anſwer, he doth firſt take off <hi>Judas</hi> his mask, and ſheweth that this did not proceed from his care of the poore, but that having the bag in his cuſtody, wherein any money Chriſt had was kept, and being a thiefe, he was ſorry he loſt ſuch a prize, whereupon he might have preyed. He is called <hi>a thiefe,</hi> either becauſe he had already interverted ſome of that money which was in his keeping, to his private uſe, or becauſe he had purpoſed ſo to do, being reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Maſter, ſince he heard of his ſufferings, and that they were now approaching. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Let men pretend never ſo fair, to cover the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of their hearts; Yet Chriſt knoweth all the ſecret deceipts of the heart, and how contrary their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to their pretences; for, here by his light, it is cleared; that <hi>he cared not for the poor.</hi> 2. As Chriſt knoweth the naughtineſſe of every heart; ſo he will, in due time, one way or other, diſcover what is within men: for, here the vail is taken off <hi>Judas, This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor.</hi> 3. Whatever hypocrites pretend, yet it is but themſelves, and ſome intereſt or advantage of their own, they drive at in all they do; for, <hi>Judaſſ's</hi> aime in all this was, to reap advantage to him ſelfe. 4. It is egregious theft before the Lord, when men do carry on their avaritious deſignes under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of caring for the poore; and when, in affection or practice, they are not faithful in what is committed to their truſt, but do intervert that to their private uſe, which is deſigned for publike or pious uſes; for, thus was <hi>Judas a thiefe,</hi> in taking to himſelfe what was to be employed for the uſe of Chriſt and his diſciples or for the poor. 5. Riches and the bag are not in ſuch eſteem with Chriſt, but that the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When Chriſt ſuffers mens corrupt affections, and ſuteable tentations and objects, to meet, it is a ſad judgement and ſnare upon them, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that he will give them up to a neck break; for, it was a ſad judgement upon <hi>Judas,</hi> that being <hi>a thiefe, he had the bag,</hi> and ſo wanted not an opportunity to ſatisfie his covetous diſpoſition.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, Chriſt having defended <hi>Mary,</hi> doth now anſwer to his great objection and pretence of caring for the poore. The defence is taken from this, that this opportunity of honouring him would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laſt, whereas they might alwayes have occaſion to be charitable to the poore. He ſpeaks it in the plural number, <hi>ye have the poor, &amp;c.</hi> either becauſe he would

preſſe this as a common duty, on all, as well as <hi>Mary;</hi> or rather he ſpeaks it to all the Diſciples, who had joined with <hi>Judas</hi> in this act, as the other Evangiliſts obſerve. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt is ſo meek, even to his cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he will not alwayes tell them all he knoweth of them, when he reproveth them, but will let them diſcover themſelves; for, he will not tell <hi>Judas</hi> his falſe heart, but ſimply replies to any ground of objection he alleaged. And this he doth; partly, becauſe moe were engaged then <hi>Judas,</hi> whom therefore he will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; Partly, that he may warn men not to ſeek to carry their cauſe by reflections upon the perſons of their oppoſites, while as they want ſolide reaſons for their cauſe; partly, that he may teach all, to beware of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Lord hath ſo ordered, that when diverſe dutie; which cannot be performed together, tryſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one juncture of time, the one of them may give way to the other for that time, without ſinne; And particularly, Duties, which occurre rarely, and cannot be got done afterward, ſhould be gone about in the opportunity thereof, albeit other important duties be laid aſide for that time, which may be overtaken at another time; As here he cleareth in the matter of putting this external honour upon him, when it tryſts with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of having a care of the poor; And for this reaſon he preferreth this duty to himſelfe now, <hi>The poor ye have alwayes, but me ye have not alwayes</hi> 3. Albeit it be a ſin to defraud Parents, the poor, or others, of what they may expect in duty, juſtice or mercy; under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of laying out what men have, for God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. Yet when Chriſt calls for any thing we have, no other thing ſhould come in competition with him; for, when he calls for it, he takes place of the poor here. 4. Men may ſometime have an opportunity of employing themſelves, or their ſubſtance, in honouring of Chriſt or doing him ſervice, which they will not ſo readily meet with again, if they let it ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where Chriſt pleaſeth to make himſelfe known, he will get reſpect and followers, were there never ſo much hazard and oppoſition in the way; for, albeit the Rulers had concluded to put him to death, and he had withdrawn upon that, and they had given charge to ſpy him out, <hi>Chap</hi> 11.53, 54, 57. yet, <hi>much people of the Jewes, knew that he was there; and they came.</hi> So ſoon as they heard of him, they flocked to him. 2. Chriſt gives ſo glorious proofes of his power and love, as may invite men to flock unto him; for, he hath with him <hi>Lazarus, whom he raiſed from the dead,</hi> to make them flock unto him. 3 It is an argument to perſwade Chriſt to help his people in their difficulties, that by ſo doing, he not only doth them good, but doth alſo bring about the manifeſtation of his glory, and an increaſe of followers; for, by raiſing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he draws them out to wait upon him. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.6, 7. 4. Albeit Chriſt will get glory, even by the unſound actings and appearings of men for him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3. Yet it is the ſin of many, that they flock to him rather out of curioſity, then in ſincerity, and that they chooſe rather to gaze upon his works, then fall in love with the worker; for ſuch was their fault here, <hi>They came not for Jeſus ſake only, but that they might ſee Lazarus alſo.</hi> They were curious to ſee ſuch a rare ſight, and, poſſibly alſo, to enquire ſomewhat of him concerning the ſtate of the dead.</p>

See <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. 2 Men once engaged in oppoſition to Chriſt, will not readily be reclaimed by inſuperable difficulties, nor the convincing beams of his glory ſhining in their eyes; for, albeit this was a glorious work prevailing on others, and albeit they ſee moe and moe impediments in their way, yet they will go on. 3. None are ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and bitter enemies to Chriſt, as corrupt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whence they once decline; for, it is <hi>the chiefe Prieſts,</hi> who are ſo cruel as to kill a man for being the harmleſſe occaſion of drawing men to Chriſt, and whom God had newly delivered from death, and teſtified he would have him live. 4. It is the great preferment,

and moſt ſpecial mercy that can be conferred on any, when they are made means and inſtruments of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſts honour and Kingdome; for, this was <hi>Lazarus</hi> dignity, that <hi>becauſe many of the Jewes went away and beleeved on Jeſus</hi> 'Tis not needful to aſſert that the faith of the moſt of them was ſound, but the leaſt degree of it in the worſt of them, was enough to irritate the Rulers. 5. Such as have received ſpecial mercies from Chriſt, or are made inſtruments of his glory, may expect that they ſhall meet with a rub, and be made the But of the malice of enemies; for there is a reſolution againſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> life, who was thus highly honoured. 6. How mad ſoever enemies be, or their projects cruel; yet they would be farre enough from their point, if Chriſt pleaſed, though they got their will; for, ſuppoſe they had put <hi>Lazarus</hi> to death, could not Chriſt raiſe him up againe as he had done even lately to their knowledge, and ſo make his glory ſhine yet more brightly?</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes is recorded the carriage of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude who are come to the Feaſt; who, (the next day after that many had been with Chriſt at <hi>Bethany</hi>) hearing that he was coming to the City, do ſolemnly meet him, carrying branches of Palm-trees, and, with loud acclamations, do proclaime him King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who is bleſſed, and cometh in the Name of the Lord. As for their action, of carrying <hi>branches of Palm trees</hi> (with ſome whereof they ſhewed the way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.8. and others, it would ſeem, they carried in their hands) we finde, indeed, uſe made thereof at the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.40. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.15. Now they carry them before him at this feaſt of the Paſſeover, to teſtifie that he is the ſubſtance of all the feaſts; And by this act, beſide what was ſignified by the feaſt of Tabernacles, is pointed out, that he is a triumphant and victorious King, which is elſewhere ſignified by carrying of palms, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7 9. As for their acclamations, they do thereby acknowledge that they ſee him to be the bleſſed Meſſiah and King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> authorized and ſent by the father to performe this glorious work; And as for their <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> (borrowed from <hi>Pſalme</hi> 118.25. as appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, as it is rendred in that Pſalme. And albeit it we take it as directed to Chriſt, by way of prayer that he would ſave them, it doth import, that it is a ſpecial way of honouring Chriſt in his Kingdome, when we ſeek and expect ſalvation from him, and in him only; yet that ſeemes not to be their ſcope here, for, <hi>Matth</hi> 21.9. it is, <hi>Hoſanna the Son of David,</hi> or, <hi>make ſafe now,</hi> or, <hi>bring ſafety now to the ſonne of David;</hi> And ſo it imports their hearty wiſh that his Kingdom may proſper. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. If Chriſt ſaw it meet, he could get himſelf glory, not only among ſpiritual obſervers; but even in the view of the world; for, by this ſolemn triumph he diſcovers how eaſily he could open the eyes of men to diſcern what he is, and incline their hearts to flock unto him, and proclaime his glory. So that it is not for want of power that Chriſt doth ſo often obſcure his glory under a vaile. 2. As Chriſt can let out his glory when he pleaſeth; ſo, in particular, he delights to appear moſt glorious in and about his ſufferings; for, here he, who oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> privately, will now at this laſt time, when he is going to the croſſe, enter in ſtate. He will go triumphing to it, as well as he triumphs on it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 15. and after it, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 68.18. 3. When Chriſts enemies are raging at him and his ſucceſſe, he can vex them yet more, by ſpreading his glory more and and more; for, when they are vexed with hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When men of great eminency in the Church do ſlight Chriſt, he can raiſe up others, even the meaneſt, to honour him, and ſet out his praiſe, for, it is not the Rulers, nay nor inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who do this, but <hi>much people that were come to the feaſt,</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. 5. As it is the duty of the Lords people, to attend all the Ordinances appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; So their chief care ſhould be to meet with Chriſt, and to be moſt taken up with him in them; for, albeit they <hi>were come to the feaſt,</hi> yet, <hi>when they heard that Jeſus was coming to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they went forth to meet him.</hi> 6. In Chriſt is to be found the ſubſtance of all the feſtivities and ſolemnities that were among the Jews; for, before him they carry <hi>Palmes,</hi> at the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, which were uſed at another feaſt to teſtifie that the ſtance of all tryſted in him. 7.

Albeit this be recorded here after the other, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples acclamations, and it is probable the people were come to him on the way, to the mount of Olives, or, at leaſt, were coming on the way, before he ſent for the aſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.1, 2. yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he was riding before theſe acclamations were. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When Chriſt manifeſts moſt of his glory in the world, he will have it ſeen that his Kingdome is not of this world; for, in all this pomp he rides but on <hi>a young aſſe,</hi> and that a borrowed one, without any furniture ſave his diſciples cloaths, and accompanied but with a traine of baſe people and children; all which might appear but very ignominious to a carnal eye. 2. We are not to carve out the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, by our carnal conceptions and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by his own Word; for whatever ignominy appear here, yet it is glorious and greater glory then any we could deviſe, in ſo farre as it agreeth with Scripture, and fore-going propheſies. 3. Chriſts Kingdome is ſo great a ſtranger to carnal glory and pomp, that any mean ſplendour is very much in it for this alſo takes off the ignominy, that this was much glory and ſtate to him, who never uſed to ride before. 4. Albeit Chriſt became poore for us, yet he wanted not any thing as he needed it, that ſo he might teach his people what care he will have of them; for, albeit he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed not ſo much as an aſſe, yet when he needed, he <hi>found a young aſſe,</hi> &amp;c or obtained the uſe of it from the owner. 5. Chriſt is a faithful obſerver of al that is written, to ſee it duly performed; for he did all this, to accompliſh what is written. 6. The encouragements of the Goſpel are not held out unto men, to cheriſh ſecurity, but to be an antidote againſt all their fears and diſcouragements; for, the ſcope of the allowance, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.10 to <hi>rejoyce, ſhout,</hi> is here ſummed up in this <hi>fear not</hi> 7.

Chriſt is <hi>Zions</hi> King, who will reſpect her, and ſee her comforted, though all the world biſide ſhould ſink; for it is to the <hi>daughter of Zion,</hi> this encouragement is given from her King. 9. Whatever be <hi>Zions</hi> perplexities, yet in Chriſt there is a remedy againſt all ſhe can feel or fear; <hi>fear not, daughter of Zion, thy King cometh.</hi> 10.

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have the firſt particular in this part of the Chapter, and an occaſion of the enſuing purpoſe; which is the deſire of ſome ſtrangers to ſee Chriſt. Wherein we may conſider. 1. The perſons who propound this deſire. They are <hi>certain Greekes that came up to worſhip.</hi> We finde indeed that the Jewes who were born and bred among the Greekes are called <hi>Grecians,</hi> or <hi>Greciſts,</hi> Acts 6.7. and 9.29. becauſe they lived among them, and uſed the Greek language, yea, and made moſt uſe of the Greek tranſlation of the Old Teſtament. But theſe ſeem not to have been of that ſort, for the deſignation is different, in the Origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, from that which is uſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and 9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears rather that theſe were devout Gentiles, who embracing the true Religion, did come up at ſolemne times to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And albeit the natural Greeks, or poſterity of <hi>Javan,</hi> were but a ſmall part of the heathen nations, and poſſibly theſe were none of them; Yet it is not unuſual in the New Teſtament, to comprehend all (or the moſt part of) Nations that were not Jewes, under the name of <hi>Greeks,</hi> Rom. 1.16. and 10.12. Gal. 3.28. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Grecian Empire had, before that time, extended it ſelfe far, and ſo gave a name to the ſubjects of their dominion; And withal, the Greek language being generally in uſe in theſe countries, and ſome Greeks being incorporate with them, it is nothing ſtrange they be ſo deſigned. Conſider. 2. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which is, that they may <hi>ſee Jeſus.</hi> It is not needful to determine, whether they had already ſeen him in the throng, and now would be more familiarly acquainted with him; But it is clear from Chriſts anſwer, and entertaining of this motion, that their deſire did ſlow from curioſity, and as they came not to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for this cauſe, ſo they minde no more but to <hi>ſee</hi> him. Conſider. 3. The way of propounding their deſire, and how it comes to be propounded unto Chriſt. They do very reſpectively propound the matter unto <hi>Philip,</hi> and he doth conſult with <hi>Andrew,</hi> and then both of them preſent it unto Chriſt. Whatever may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in this procedure; as that they make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Chriſt by means of his Apoſtles, and that <hi>Philip</hi> makes a ſtand in the matter till he get further advice, becauſe theſe were Gentiles who had been excluded in their firſt commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. Yet Chriſts ſtrange doctrine, on this propoſition, intimateth that he did not reliſh it well. I ſhall not determine that they uſed this mean, to get a meeting with Chriſt in private, as not deſiring to be ſeen owning him, againſt whom the Rulers had ſuch indignation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.57. But this is clear enough, that they in propounding, &amp; the diſciples in entertaining it, keep too great a ſtate in it, as if acceſſe into Chriſt were not eaſie. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Albeit it pleaſed the Lord, till the fulneſſe of time, to give up all Nations, and did only chooſe the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his peculiar people; Yet it pleaſed him, even then, to bring in ſome ſtrangers, as the firſt fruits, till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhould be brought in, and the portition wall be taken away; for, there were <hi>certain Greekes among them at the feaſt.</hi> And in dedicating of the Temple, a roome was left for theſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.41, 42, 43. 2. Whatever the Lord conferre upon his people, in their private and ſecret worſhip; yet it is their duty not to be content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor can they prove that it is ſound and ſincere, unleſſe they do alſo frequent publike Ordinances where they may be had, were it at a great diſtance; for, theſe <hi>Greeks came up to worſhip at the feaſt,</hi> though poſſibly they lived far off, ſome of them. Though there was ſomewhat typical in theſe feaſts, yet they were alſo ſolemne parts of the Jewiſh worſhip; And their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting thereof at the Lords command, will condemne them who are not put to ſuch pains, and yet prove negligent. 3. Chriſt, when he is known in any meaſure, will be thought a deſireable ſight; Therefore they <hi>would ſee Jeſus.</hi> 4. Such as would make acquaintance with Chriſt, ought not to neglect the ordinary means, or to make uſe of his ſervants; for, in ſo far they were right, in that they <hi>came to Philip, and deſired him, ſaying, Sir, we would ſee Jeſus.</hi> We need not conceive that they came to <hi>Philip,</hi> upon any particular acquaintance, becauſe he was of <hi>Bethſaida of Galilee,</hi> which lay nearer the confines of the Land; But becauſe they met firſt with him. And they call him <hi>Sir,</hi> though a fiſherman, as being the civil compellation of theſe times, given even to mean perſons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20 15. 5. Many, even of them who make much noiſe of deſiring to ſee Chriſt, may yet be driven ſo to do, out of meer curioſity, and for carnal reſpects; for, ſuch was their deſire here, to <hi>ſee
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48148:129"/>
Jeſus,</hi> and but to ſee and gaze on him, who had been made ſo famous in the late triumph. 6. It is the duty of diſciples, to make mens acquaintance with Chriſt; for whatever was their fault, in not taxing what was amiſſe, or in their own way, yet it was no fault, but their duty, to make up the acquaintance. 7. It is a great miſtake, and an injury done to Chriſt, to think that he will keep a ſtate and diſtance from ſinners who ſincerely ſeek him; And his ſervants do but an ill office, when they foment ſuch apprehenſions; for, whatever they deſerved, yet they miſtake Chriſt, when they thought he was like a King, who could not be come unto but by ſome of his courtiers, and favorits; whereas many needy ſinners did come to him immediatly; and <hi>Philip</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrangers take notice of him, doth ſinne in making ſuch a buſineſſe of ſtate of it, as might confirme them in this opinion. 8. Chriſts Court would be but ill guided, if any (though even diſciples) did guide it but himſelfe; Men would readily befriend them who are not ſo welcome, and would neglect the needy, and might point out Chriſt as more ſtrange then indeed he is; for, here the diſciples, who ſleighted little children and the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> now, when they think their Maſter is like to be eſteemed of among ſtrangers, they are foot and hand for them, though they were nothing ſo ſincere, and they do, by conſulting one with another, bear theſe ſtrangers in hand, that it was not eaſie to finde acceſſe to him, that ſo they may admire him the more.</p>

                  <p>Followeth to <hi>ver.</hi> 27. the ſecond particular in this part of the Chapter, containing Chriſts anſwer to this propoſition; wherein. 1. (in this verſe) Sleighting their curious deſire, and tacitely reprehending the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples carnal way of managing it; he ſheweth, that he had other true glory to look to, which made him vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend this carnal reſpect tendered unto him by ſtrangers, to wit, the glory of, and following upon, his ſufferings which were near approaching And withal, by this doctrine, he points out that they ought to ſeek acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, not as a man lately cryed up by popular applauſe, but as a glorified Chriſt on the triumphant chariot of his croſſe, and exalted at the Fathers right hand. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt takes no pleaſure to ſatisfie the curioſity of men, nor in worldly glory, nor, will he foſter his followers in an eſtimation of it; Therefore doth he ſleight this motion, and preaches what was of more importance. He will not call them into his preſence, but by his doctrine doth teſtifie he did not reliſh the reſpects they offered to him. 2. As ſad ſufferings may be following cloſe after ſome ſun-blenk of glory and triumph; So it concerns the Lords people to meditate and reſolve thereupon, even in their beſt dayes: for, after Chriſts triumph, <hi>the hour</hi> of his ſuffering <hi>is come,</hi> or near approaching: and he is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating thereupon. 3. Divine providence is ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular about all things, particularly, about the ſufferings of Chriſt and his followers; that not ſo much as the hour when ſufferings ſhall begin, but it is determined: Therefore, ſaith he, ſo particularly, <hi>the hour is come,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Such as would take a right look of the ſufferings of Chriſt and his followers, ought to look through all the pain, bitterneſſe, or ignominy, that is in them, and fix their eye upon the glory that is in that lot, and followeth thereupon; for, thus doth Chriſt leave us an example, who in ſpeaking of the approaching time of his ſuffering, declareth that he looks upon it as an hour wherein the <hi>Sonne of man is to be glorified.</hi> This was true, even of his very ſufferings, that he was glorified in being called to exerce the office of a Prieſt for his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. And ſo alſo Saints have looked on their ſufferings for him, as an high honour conferred upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. But it was more viſibly verified in the iſſue of his ſufferings, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.11. when in his own perſon he was exalted unto glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. and by the vertue of his death became great in the world, as <hi>verſe</hi> 32. of this Chapter. 5. Such as get open eyes to diſcerne the glory of the croſſe; and the glory that abides Chriſt and his followers after their ſuffering, will not care for, nor reliſh worldly pomp and glory, or carnal reſpect from men; Therefore Chriſt ſleights this offer, becauſe his eye was fixed elſewhere; <hi>The hour is come, that the Son of man ſhould be glorified.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 27. and 12.2 6. Chriſt will entertain no acquaintance with any, unleſſe his croſſe be beautiful unto them, and unleſſe they lay aſide doating on his bodily preſence, and ſtudy communion with him in his ſufferings and exaltation; for, while as they ſought to converſe with him bodily, and ſee his imagined outward glory, he, in his anſwer, remits them to his ſuffering and exaltation ſhortly approaching, to ſtudy acquaintance with him there.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, becauſe Chriſts ſuffering as the way to his glory, did ſtumble many of theſe who had carnal imaginations concerning the Meſſiah; Therefore (in this <hi>verſe</hi>) he clears the neceſſity of his dying, by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude taken from grain, which unleſſe it be towen and die in the ground, can produce no increaſe; but being ſown, it bringeth forth much fruit. Even ſo, unleſſe he died, there would be no converſion of loſt men unto God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The neceſſity and uſefulneſſe of the croſſe is not eaſily beleeved by the Sons of men; And it is a point to be received on Chriſts word, who will not deceive; Therefore, doth he begin this doctrine concerning his ſufferings, with ſo grave an aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> 2. If Chriſt had not dyed, and continued for a while under the power of death, we could reap no profit by him, nor would any have gone to heaven with him; for, <hi>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone,</hi> and ſo had been here. It had been no prejudice to him, only his love could not be without us, nor had it been manifeſted, unleſſe he had brought many Sonnes into glory, but all the loſſe had been ours. 3. Chriſts death hath produced a fair harveſt of fruit on the earth, many being drawn unto him, and many ſweet fruits
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48148:130"/>
flowing from his death to them; for, <hi>if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit,</hi> and ſo is it here. And thus alſo doth the Lord bleſſe the afflictions, even of Saints, to bring out much good. 4. The profit that flows from the croſſe of Chriſt and his followers, ought to prevent any ſtumbling there at; for by this argument Chriſt obviates the ſcandal here. And indeed, if the fruit of the croſſe be an argument to move him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, much more ſhould it take away our ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt place, Chriſt having acquainted them with what was his true glory, and the way to it, doth now point out the way how to come and have communion with him therein, to wit, by taking up the croſſe, and following him. And for this end. 1. He ſets forth the danger of irreſolution, and the good of reſolution, in this point, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. A man that is ſparing, if it were even of his life when Chriſt calls for it, doth take the ready way to loſe it, and he who doth hazard it for him at his call, is ſure to live eternally. 2. He points out their obligation to this duty, that if any will be his ſervants, it is reaſon they follow him in the paths he hath troden, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. — 3. He ſubjoins, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of ſuch, that if they follow him as ſervants, they ſhall enjoy, his company, and if they honour him, the Father will honour them, <hi>verſe</hi>—26.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough that Chriſts followers leave off to ſtumble at his ſufferings, or at the afflictions of others, unleſſe they be content alſo to ſubmit to the croſſe, without ſtumbling, in their own perſons; Therefore doth he ſubjoine this doctrine to the former concerning his death, to breed them with the croſſe in their own perſons. 2. Albeit Chriſt may let ſome eaſily ſlip through, and others get away with ſome ſmall loſſe; yet he approves of no followers, who are not reſolved on the loſſe of what is deareſt to them, yea, even of life, for his ſake: Therefore doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our <hi>life</hi> to be hated, not ſecluding other things, as parents, wife, children, houſes, lands, &amp;c. but including them all in this, as being the moſt precious enjoyment. And ſince ſome are put to that, all muſt reſolve on it. 3. Its not enough that men quit any thing for Chriſt, unleſſe it be done with cheerfulneſſe, zeal, and an holy indignation that any thing, how precious ſoever, ſhould come in competition with obedience to him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> required, that they <hi>hate their life;</hi> Which is not to be underſtood abſolutely, as if it were a ſin, to love life, as it is the gift of God, or that they ſhould weary of it; But comparatively, that they ſhould not love it more then Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. and ſhould abho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re that it ſhould come in competition with duty to him. 4. Whatever be our obligations to Chriſt, yet mens inordinate affection to their temporal life is a great impediment to our duty, when it comes to that puſh; for, it is ſuppoſed that too many will <hi>love their life,</hi> (to wit, <hi>in this world,</hi> or their temporal life;) ſo as to preferre the preſervation of it to obedience and a good conſcience. 5. Whoever are careful to preſerve their temporal life upon any tearmes, they take the ſhort cut to looſe it, and eternal life alſo; for, <hi>he that loveth his life ſhall looſe it.</hi> He both provokes Chriſt to plague that life, and cut it off, which he will not employ in a good cauſe, and however it fare with his temporal life, yet he looſeth eternal life. 6. As the looſe grip of things temporal is the ſureſt and beſt grip; ſo when a man preferres ſervice to Chriſt to his own life, it is the ſure way to preſerve both body and ſoul unto life eternal; for, <hi>he that hates his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternal.</hi> Some time the Lord may continue and preſerve a mans life, after he hath ſubmitted to looſe it for his ſake: But however that ſucceed, yet the other incouragement ſtands firme. 7. They who have the lively hope of eternal life, will eaſily digeſt any temporal loſſe, eſpecially when that hope cannot be attained without that loſſe; for, preſervation <hi>unto eternal life,</hi> is ſufficient to perſwade a man, when he is called to it, to <hi>hate his life in this world.</hi> 8 Such as live by faith, muſt renounce the principles of carnal ſenſe and reaſon, and be content to walk on grounds contrary to theſe, eſpecially in times of trial; for, they muſt learn that love, and keeping of life is loſſe, and hatred, and loſing of it is keeping of it.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 26. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of glorious-like outſide acquaintance with men, unleſſe they engage themſelves in humble ſervice to him; Therefore, in oppoſition to their deſire <hi>of ſeeing him,</hi> verſe 21. he deſires that <hi>men ſhould ſerve him.</hi> 2. Such as give up themſelves to ſerve Chriſt, muſt not in their duties preſcribe unto him, but muſt be content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his directions; And in their lots, they muſt not think it ill to be no better uſed then he was, but ſhould account the worſt condition ſweet and eaſie, in that he eſſayed it, and paved the way before them; for, ſaith he, <hi>if any man ſerve me, let him follow me.</hi> 3. Such as ſerve Chriſt, by following him, ſhall be ſure not only to ſee him, but to enjoy his company: He will be with them in trouble, and not let them be alone, and they ſhall be brought, at laſt, to partake of the ſweet iſſue that followed on his ſuffering; for, <hi>where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 4. It is a ſweet encouragement to ſincere followers of Chriſt, that in glory they ſhall have conſtant and neer fellowſhip with him, which they are ſo much thirſting after in their pilgrimage; for, this is the encouragement of ſervants, <hi>where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.</hi> 5. Whatever diſgrace Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may meet with; yet to ſerve him is their true honour, and will be rewarded at laſt with viſible hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; for, <hi>if any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour.</hi> See 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 2.30. 6. He ſaith here, <hi>my Father will honour him,</hi> not only to point out that it is true honour only which is conferred by God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. But to teach, That Chriſt as Mediatour is ſo accepted of the Father, that he will put marks of favour and honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his ſervants.</p>

                  <p>Followeth, to <hi>verſe</hi> 31. the third particular in this part of the chapter, wherein (to prevent ſtumbling at his death) it is made evident, firſt, by ſore exerciſe, and then by conſolation ſent from heaven, that it was the Will of God he ſhould ſuffer, and yet not ſink under it. His exerciſe is recorded, <hi>v.</hi> 27. his out-gate and conſolation, <hi>v.</hi> 28. unto which is ſubjoyned an expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods purpoſe in this way of comforting of him, upon occaſion of the ſeveral thoughts of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe his exerciſe is pointed out in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. 1. That while he is preaching of his own death and ſuffering, trouble doth ſeize upon his ſoul in the midſt of his doctrine, and he is ſo overwhelmed, that he cannot get it hid, but muſt tell it out before all his hearers. 2. That he is ſo perplexed, that he knows not what to ſay. 3. That getting a vent in prayer, there is a conflict betwixt his averſeneſſe from this lot and exerciſe, and his ſubmiſſion to endure what his office called him unto. Now for clearing this ſoul-trouble of Chriſt, (which we finde very familiar to him, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.33. and 13.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. and 27.46.) we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 1. The riſe and cauſe of it was thus, The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head hiding it ſelf from the humanities ſenſe, and the Father letting out, not only an apprehenſion of his ſufferings to come, but a preſent taſte of the horrour of his wrath due to man for ſin, he is amazed, overwhelmed, and perplexed with it in his humanity; And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſince he had the ſinnes of all the Elect laid upon him by imputation, to ſuffer for. And ſo this wrath is not let out againſt his perſon, but again their ſinnes which were laid on him. 2. Albeit Chriſts ſoul was here <hi>troubled,</hi> or <hi>jumbled,</hi> and <hi>puzzled,</hi> as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: Yet we are not to conceive there was any ſin in this exerciſe of his,, though the like may be muddy in us. For we are like foule water, which being ſtirred, becomes like a puddle, but he was like clean water in a clean veſſel, which being never ſo often ſtirred and ſhaken, yet keeps ſtill clean and clear. 3. We are not to think it ſtrange that the Sonne of God ſhould be put to ſuch perplexities in this trouble, as not to know what to ſay; For, conſidering him as man encompaſſed with our ſinleſſe infirmities, and that this heavy weight of wrath did light upon him on a ſudden, it is no wonder it did confound all his thoughts as man. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſires and debates of Chriſt, in his voluntary exinanition, were without all ſinful infirmitie; For in his deſiring the trouble to be removed, he teſtified that his holy and ſinleſſe nature did abhor to lie under wrath; and in his being willing to ſuffer, he cleares that in reſpect of his office and being our Surety, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth himſelf, and ſubmits to what his office required of him, and what his Father had appointed him to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, how much ſoever he abhorred it.</p>
                  <p>From this whole purpoſe in general, we may <hi>learn.</hi> 1. The ſad agonies of Chriſts ſoul, being under the burden of ſinne imputed to him, is a mirrour wherein we may read the bitter deſert of ſinne, what bitter wrath follows upon it; and how abominable it is, that produceth ſuch fruits. 2. We may h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> in alſo read how impartial a Judge God is, and how impartial in craving and taking ſatisfaction for ſin; ſo that if his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne come betwixt ſinners and the ſtroke, he will not ſpare him, but let out ſuch ſad ſoul-trouble upon him. And this may make the ſinnes of the Elect bitter to them, that they did pierce Chriſt, and did make him a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs. 3. This may alſo diſcover unto us what difficulty there was in the work of our Redemption, that it put the Sonne of God to ſuch preſſures, and perplexities, to carry thor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w under it. 4. Herein alſo ſhines forth the love of the Father, in giving his Son; and the Sonnes love in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this hard task, and drinking this bitter cup, for their take who were living in enmity againſt him, and who cannot be profitable unto him. 5. Such as in the ſenſe of ſinne, and deſerved wrath, do flee to Chriſt, will finde him a tender Saviour, who is experimentally acquainted with all their ſinleſſe infirmities, and with all theſe tentations they are vexed with, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne; for, he hath drunk of that bitter cup. 6. Chriſt, in his own perſon, hath ſanctified trouble and diſtreſſe of minde to all his followers, as here is left upon record. 7. In this exerciſe we may reade, to whom it is we owe any true peace of conſcience we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; even to him, upon whom the chaſtiſement of our peace was, and who endured this trouble, that we might reſt ſafely under his ſhadow. 8. The godly may alſo learn hence a good uſe of any trouble of mind that comes upon them; even to learn hereby ſomewhat of his bitter ſufferings for them, that ſo he may be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their eyes. 9. We may read in this exerciſe and experience of Chriſt, how ſoon a good condition may be clouded, and how one may be well and have help near them, and yet not ſee it; for, Chriſt, while he is thus troubled, is ſtill the Sonne of God and beloved of him, and his out-gate is very near, yet for the preſent he is over-clouded, and taken up with nothing but perplexity and horrour. 10. Finally, this ſad trouble and exerciſe of Chriſt may point out, what will be the ſad lot of all the wicked, who have not Chriſt to ſatisfie for them; for, if this be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the drie? <hi>Luke</hi> 23.31.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, from the words and context, <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. As ſinne hath infected both ſoul and body of the Elect, and chiefly the ſoul, where it hath its chief ſeat: So Chriſt, to expiate this ſinne, did ſuffer unſpeakable ſorrows and trouble in his ſoul, as well as torture in his body; for, <hi>my ſoul is troubled,</hi> ſaith he. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. 2. Albeit ſome ſufferings of the body be very exquiſite and painful, and Chriſts, in particular, was ſuch; yet ſad trouble of mind is far more grievous then any bodily diſtreſſe: As Chriſt alſo found, who ſilently bare all his outward troubles, but muſt cry out of the other, <hi>now is my ſoul troubled.</hi> 3. Sad trouble of minde is very hard to conceal and ſmother from the knowledge of others, nor have they cauſe to complaine of extremity, who get it hid: And they who get their
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48148:131"/>
exerciſe hid, ought to acknowledge Chriſt; who was put to proclaime his trouble before a multitude, that theirs might be more eaſie. And on the other hand, when any are driven to that extremity, that they muſt cry out of ſoul-trouble, they may finde this exerciſe, ſanctified on Chriſts perſon, who in the midſt of a multitude, muſt interrupt preaching, and cry out, <hi>now is my ſoul troubled.</hi> 4. Albeit Chriſt be God over all, bleſſed for ever; yet it pleaſed him in going through his ſufferings, ſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelf, as to wreſtle with horrour, fears, &amp; perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under them, and to fight with the weapons he hath left for Saints in like caſes; that ſo he may be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and merciful high Prieſt, and may aſſure them of ſucceſſe, who in the like caſe, make uſe of the like means; For, whereas upon Chriſts former doctrine, of his ſufferings, and the duty of his followers to ſuffer, any might be ready to think that it was eaſie for him to ſpeak of trouble and beare it, in reſpect of others; Therefore he lets them ſee, that he had the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, trouble, perplexities and fears about it (though without ſinne) that Saints have, and that he uſed the ſame weapons of prayer, wreſtling, and ſubmiſſion, that are left unto them. 5. A ſpecial mean for raiſing trouble in a tender minde, is their thinking much upon it, which doth beget and waken it; for, ſo was it with Chriſt while he is thinking and preaching of his ſufferings, trouble ariſeth: <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled,</hi> ſaith he. And albeit Chriſt was ſinleſſe in ſo doing, yet it is our ſinne oft-times to beget trouble, by our muſing upon it. 6. There is a vaſt difference betwixt the moſt exact comprehenſion of trouble in the judgement, and the experimental feeling thereof in the ſenſes; The one may be without ſo much vexation and trouble as the other will produce. This alſo appears in Chriſts exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, who though he underſtood perfectly what his ſufferings ſhould be, and had reſolved upon them; yet when he came to feele trouble, it raiſeth all this perplexitie. And however Chriſt went beyond us in this, that he met with all he reſolved upon, which made it thus heavy; whereas we are oft-times diſappointed in our apprehenſions, and get leſſe then we look for; And ſo the trouble it ſelf is oft-times eaſier then the exerciſe and apprehenſion of it; Yet this experience of Chriſts may learn all, never to truſt their own reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for trouble, but to make ready for it, if God ſend it on, as another thing to preſent ſenſe and feeling then any thing they could imagine. 7. How ſtout ſoever the hearts of men be, yet when the Lord lets out trouble for ſin, it will damp them, and put them to a non-plus in all their reſolutions, that they ſhall not know what to do or ſay; for, if the great teacher of his Church, who hath much to ſay for our counſel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſuch caſes; if he, I ſay, under this cloud, be ſo puzzled, as he is put to <hi>what ſhall I ſay?</hi> what may others expect? 8. As Chriſt, by his perplexitie till he had nothing to ſay, hath purchaſed an open mouth to his people in their addreſſes to God; So when any of them are perplexed, they ought not to be diſcouraged at it, but ſhould look to him who hath taſted of that cup for their comfort and behoof. Therefore is it left on record, that he was put to <hi>what ſhall I ſay?</hi> not asking counſel at any by this queſtion, but teſtifying his real perplexity. 9. Prayer is the ſpecial mean of relieving troubled and perplexed ſouls, which will finde out a vent and outgate to perplexity, if there be any to be found under, or in heaven; Therefore Chriſt betaketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this remedy. And whoſoever do neglect it, and betake themſelves to carnal ſhifts, will prove Phyſicians of no value, and will heal their own wounds ſlightly, or prove miſerable comforters, and adde to their own ſorrows. 10. As God doth not break off his relations to his people, when he plungeth them under ſad exerciſes and perplexities, but continueth ſtill a Father; ſo it is the duty of Saints, to hold faſt this intereſt, and to make uſe of it in prayer; and it may be cleaved unto, in the midſt of great perplexities; For, in this Chriſt hath caſt us a copy, who in all this agony, pleads with God as his <hi>Father,</hi> and teacheth Saints, that they have warrant to do the like. 11. Albeit Chriſts wreſtling betwixt the inclination of his holy nature, and his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by his office, was free of ſinne as hath been cleared; Yet his experience of this exerciſe may teach Saints, that he will be very tender of their ravings in their feavers, and that he will pity them when they are toſſed betwixt inclination and conſcience of duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a willing ſpirit and weak fleſh, and when the fleſhes word is firſt out, and the Spirits word followeth after it, to correct it; for, here he hath come as neare us in this exerciſe as might be without ſinne, that he might ſympathize with us in it. 12. Were our diſtreſſe and perplexities never ſo great, yet it is our duty to beleeve the power of God, that he is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of them all, if he pleaſe; for, Chriſts prayer, <hi>ſave me from this houre,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, this ſad ſit of trouble, doth import that he beleeveth God could do it, if he would. 13. The ſenſe of wrath is inſupportable to humane fleſh, and ſinleſſe nature will abhor to be under the wrath of God, above any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her ſad lot; for, both theſe are imported in this prayer of Chriſt, <hi>ſave me from this houre,</hi> as is before explained. 14. Saints ought not to be diſcouraged, when the ſtrength of exerciſe and tentation doth overturn their reſolutions for a time; but they are to expect, that after they are laid by, they may yet recover and acquit themſelves as becometh; for, herein Chriſt hath paved a way, though without ſinne, who after his holy inclination would have declined his work, yet continues reſolute to undertake it. 15. It is the duty of Saints, not to lean much to their own inclinations, eſpecially under exerciſe, how innocent ſoever they ſeeme to be; But they ought to reckon that uſually their inclinations and choice are different from what is their duty, and the Will of God concerning them. For ſo much doth Chriſts exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe teach us, who though he without ſinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to decline wrath, yet he quits that deſire, becauſe the thing deſired was inconſiſtent with that to which God had called him. 16. The conſcience of our duty, and of our obligation to God not to neglect it, ought to moderate our deſires concerning our own ſafeties; for, ſo doth Chriſt recal his former deſire with this, <hi>But for this cauſe came I unto this houre.</hi> That is, this calling to ſuffer, this was laid upon me, and I have undertaken it, and therefore will not now decline it. 17. Chriſt commends his love unto his people; in that he would decline nothing that his office and calling required ſhould be done for them, how much ſoever he abhorred it in his ſinleſſe nature: Therefore after he had teſtified his abhorring this cup, yet for our ſake he ſubmits to drink it.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe is recorded Chriſts outgate and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; it begins at ſubmiſſion in his prayer, that God would ſo diſpoſe of him, as might glorifie his own Name, without reſpect to his eaſe or inclination. And as this evidenceth the calme temper of his minde ſo his conſolation is perfected by a voice from heaven, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as the Father had glorified his Name already in Chriſts life, ſo he would glorifie it yet more in his death.</p>
                  <p>From Chriſts ſubmiſſion, <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Gods children, not to expect always, or, at the firſt, an outgate by a change of Gods diſpenſations toward them, but rather to ſeek it by a change of their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition within them, making them fit to undergo ſuch diſpenſations; for, herein Chriſt hath caſt us a copy, in laying aſide the inclination of his nature to be rid of trouble, and ſubmitting to it. 2. It is the duty of Saints under trouble, to prefer the honour of God, and to ſeek how it may be advanced, before their own eaſe; for, Chriſt ends all his debates with this, <hi>Father glorifie thy Name,</hi> though by my trouble and ſuffering. 3. Submiſſion unto the Will of God is a real outgate from trouble, and a ſpecial victory over it; for, hereby Chriſt gets an iſſue of his agony and perplexities, <hi>Father glorifie thy Name.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39 <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. 4. The way to attaine ſubmiſſion, is, to be tender of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to account that dearer unto us then any thing elſe; for, this leads Chriſt to ſubmit unto this bitter cup, that hereby <hi>the Father glorifieth his Name.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, mens ſelfiſhneſſe and want of zeal is a great enemy to their ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>From the Lords comfortable anſwer, <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Soreſt exerciſes are not ſent on Gods children to deſtroy them, but when in their perplexities, they ſeek to God and ſubmit to him, there will be a comfortable iſſue; for, immediately <hi>there came a voice from heaven, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo not only is he delivered, but the ſorer his exerciſe had been, it is the ſhorter. 2. There is no true comfort againſt ſoul-trouble, but what comes from God, and is ſpoken by him from heaven; for, this comforts Chriſt, <hi>There came a voice from heaven.</hi> And albeit we are not to expect ſuch extraordinary manifeſtations, (nor did Chriſt ſimply need them in ſuch a way, <hi>v.</hi> 30.) yet it muſt be ſpoken from the Word by God to the heart, before we get eaſe. 3. Such as are truly exerciſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will finde eaſe in comfortable promiſes, clearing their condition from the Word, albeit the trouble lie on; for, thus Chriſt is comforted by <hi>a voice from heaven,</hi> clearing his caſe. 4. Chriſt is a ſupplicant whoſe voice is acknowledged by the Father, as the voice of his Son, in that for which he ſeeks to him; for, here his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is anſwered by <hi>a voice from heaven.</hi> 5. The Father is glorified in the life and ſufferings of Chriſt, and not only doth the Sonne glorifie him herein, but he undertakes to glorifie himſelf: As here his anſwer doth ſhew, <hi>I have both glorified it, and I will glorifie it againe.</hi> 6. The Lords anſwers to troubled ſouls are very full, clearing all they do or can propound, and all they feele, or is lying upon them; for he not only undertakes to glorifie his Name in that wherewith Chriſt is now troubled, but cleares further what he had done. 7. Gods ſpeaking to a troubled ſoul, brings not only comfort under their preſent preſſures; but is a <hi>Piſgah</hi> from whence they may take a comfortable view of their by-paſt lots, and may ſee faire ground of hope for time to come; for, in this comfort, God cleares both by-gones and the time to come, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again.</hi>

Chriſt doth expound Gods purpoſe in this publick way of comforting him; That he did it, not ſo much becauſe Chriſt needed it, as to teſtifie unto them that he was accepted of God, owned of him in his ſufferings, and would be victorious over them through him. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. God is very glorious and full of Majeſty, and appeares ſo when he reveals himſelf; His voice even in conſolations, is glorious; for his voice here was ſuch as <hi>the people ſaid, that it thundered,</hi> when they heard it. 2. As natural men are ignorant of ſpiritual ſoul-trouble, ſo do they as little underſtand the conſolations which God alloweth on theſe who are ſo exerciſed; for, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of this matter, but ſome (it ſeems) who were more remote, <hi>ſaid, it thundered, others</hi> more neare, <hi>ſaid, an Angel ſpake to him.</hi> 3. It is the great fault of men that they delight rather to talk curiouſly of the extraordinary manifeſtations of God, then ſtudy to know the uſe to be made of them; Therefore they are curiouſly debating what this ſhould meane, when Chriſt tells them they ſhould ſtudy <hi>for whoſe ſake</hi> it came. 4. Conſolations are then double conſolations, when men are not only refreſhed thereby, but are led to know how they ought to be improven. Thus Chriſt is led to look on this <hi>voice, for whoſe ſake it comes,</hi> and knows what uſe ſhould be made thereof. 5. All the glorious teſtimonies given unto Chriſt from heaven, tended to point him out unto ſinners; as the true Meſſiah approven of God; And that for the conviction of the malicious and for the encouragement and confirmation of their faith who flee to him; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>This voice came not becauſe of me, but for your ſakes.</hi> He needed indeed the conſolation, and it might have been impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in a private way; But this publick way of declaring the conſolation, was for their behoof.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes is recorded the fourth particular in this part of the Chapter, namely, that Chriſt being now calmed in his exerciſe, and refreſhed with the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, doth reſume the point he had been upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24. and publiſheth more fully the glorious fruits and effects of his death. The fruits of his death, here mentioned, are, 1. The judgement of this world. 2. The caſting out of Satan the prince of this world, <hi>ver</hi> 31. 3. The drawing of all men to him when he is lifted up from the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. which <hi>lifting up,</hi> he expounds to ſignifie the manner of his death, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. Now for right underſtanding this purpoſe, the great difficultie is, to take up rightly the firſt fruit of his death, concerning <hi>the judgement of this world,</hi> which may be diverſly taken, according to the different accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the words <hi>judgement,</hi> and <hi>world,</hi> which may be diverſe wayes expounded: For, firſt, Takeing the <hi>world</hi> for the world of the Elect (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. where the reaſons of this denomination are given) the meaning will be, That they are judged in Chriſt their head; That is, partly, they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, who in his ſufferings repreſented and ſtood Surety for them all, and was accuſed, ſentenced, and put to an accurſed death for them, and ſo God for ſinne condemned their ſin in Chriſts fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. And partly, that by this judgement of Chriſt in their name, there ariſeth a judgement of abſolution to them, in their own perſons, through him. This in it ſelfe is a clear and uſeful truth, and doth well agree alſo with the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Satan, after mentioned; Yet it doth not exhauſt the fall ſcope of this place. And albeit the Elect, conſidered by themſelves, be ſometimes called, <hi>the world,</hi> yet it is not ſo clear in Scripture, that they ſhould be called ſo emphatically, <hi>This world,</hi> (which is uſually taken in another ſenſe) eſpecially, when in the next words, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>This world</hi> are they of whom Satan is Prince and God; For, albeit he reigne in the Elect, while they are children of diſobedience and of wrath, as well as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3 Yet it is not in reſpect of them that he is <hi>Prince of this world,</hi> and therefore the name is not ſo proper to them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, underſtanding this purpoſe of the reprobate world, over whom Satan is Prince, the meaning is, that they are judged, or condemned, in the ſufferings of Chriſt; which holds true in theſe reſpects. 1. It ſeals up the condemnation of all theſe, unto whom this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe is revealed, and yet do reject the offer. 2. The ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of Chriſt are a pattern and exemplary, making manifeſt what is the judgement abiding the wicked, for whom this purch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ee, what ſhall be done in the dry? 3. They are condemned in Satan their head and Prince, who was foiled and caſt out by the death of Chriſt on the Croſſe, even as the Elect are judged and abſolved in the ſuffering and victory of Chriſt their head. Theſe are indeed truths which do agree well with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, Thirdly, That I may fall upon a more full interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, It would be conſidered, that the tearme, <hi>this world,</hi> or, <hi>the world,</hi> at it is ſometime taken for this preſent life and enjoyments thereof, in oppoſition to eternity, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. and elſewhere: So it is uſed, ſometime, to point out the ſtate of this inferiour world, and all perſons therein, as they are corrupted and out of frame by the fall of man. Thus to be <hi>of this world,</hi> is to be in a corrupt eſtate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.23. we are not to be conforme to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. ought to <hi>keep our ſelves unſpotted from it,</hi> Jam. 1.27. The wiſdome thereof is condemned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. and its courſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. and the world, and things thereof, are to be diſclaimed, as not being of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16. Againe, the word, <hi>judgement,</hi> in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> phraſe, (uſual to the New Teſtament) doth ſignifie the exerciſe of power and authority, for reformation of abuſes, and reſtauration of things that are out of frame, to their right and primitive order. Yet ſo, as including a condemnation of all that bred this diſturbance, or is worthy to be condemned, and an abſolution and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into liberty all theſe who were wronged under that diſorder. According to theſe ſignifications of the tearmes, the ſenſe of the words will be this; (agreeable to <hi>Daniels</hi> prediction, of Chriſts <hi>making an end of ſins, and bringing in everlaſting righteouſneſſe,</hi> by his death, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.) That, whereas by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the world hath fallen into confuſion and diſorder, man hath fallen from integrity and happineſſe, Satan and ſin have reigned and raged in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. The children of this world have bleſſed themſelves in their bad condition, and the Elect have lien under ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage: Now Chriſt, by his death, hath taken away this diſorder; by dethroning and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſturbers, ſin and Satan; by bringing in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſſe; by manifeſting the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked, and by reſtoring the Elect to that happineſſe they were deprived of by ſin. This I take to be the moſt ſatisfactory interpretation, partly, becauſe it is moſt comprehenſive; for albeit ſinne and Satan be condemned and caſt out only in reſpect of the Elect world, and the reſtauration be only purchaſed to them; yet the interpretation alſo includes all the other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, of condemning ſin and Satan, and of the Reprobates, as is before explained, and the abſolution of the Elect through him who was condemned as their ſurety: And partly, becauſe it runs well with the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt of the fruits of his death here mentioned. For this <hi>judgement of this world,</hi> is put firſt, as a comprehenſive and general fruit, that hereby he reformes theſe things that were out of frame by the fall of man. The next of <hi>Satans caſting out,</hi> is ſubjoyned, to point out the mean and way of this reſtauration, namely, by dethroning the uſurper and diſturber. And the third, of <hi>drawing all men to him,</hi> is added, as an effect and further explication of this reſtauration of the Elect world; that he will draw them to himſelfe, the fountain and channel of that happineſſe which they loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> It is further to be

conſidered, for clearing the words, That while Chriſt ſaith, <hi>now,</hi> in his ſufferings, <hi>is the judgement of this world,</hi> and Satan caſt out, we muſt avoid two rocks in underſtanding of them. 1. That we conceive not of this, as if this judgement, and caſting out had not been in the world before the time of Chriſts death: For the Elect were made partakers of the benefite hereof in all ages before the Incarnation of Chriſt. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is partlie, that this world was never judged, nor Satan caſt out at any time, but by vertue of his death which he was now to ſuffer, and that now he was to pay the price, and fight the good fight, by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is, that in any age, Satan is foiled, and the world judged: And partly, that now he was to have more viſible and copious fruits of this judgement then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, eſpecially, thoughout the world, and not among the Jewes only. 2. We are not to conceive as if this judgement of reſtauration, and the caſting out of Satan, were compleated and perfected at the death of Chriſt; For, albeit the purchaſe be then compleatly made, yet the application doth but follow in due time to the Elect, and that is carried on by degrees, till in the great day, there be a compleat <hi>reſtitution of all things, Acts</hi> 3.21. and a ſolide victory and triumph over all our enemies. And therefore it is ſpoken of by way of promiſe for the future, <hi>the Prince of this world ſhall be caſt out,</hi> and <hi>I will draw all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to repeat the ſeveral inſtructions which have been pointed at in the ſeveral interpretations of the firſt phraſe, (all which are included in this interpretation) we may further, from <hi>verſe</hi> 31. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever be the ſharp exerciſes of Saints under the ſenſe of wrath; yet it is to be expected they will have an end, if not alſo paſſe ſhortly over; for, this encouragement is given us in the experience of our head, who is now in a ſhort time calmed. See <hi>Iſa</hi> 54.7, 8. And albeit <hi>Heman</hi> had a long time of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. Yet he ſaw an end of it. 2.

How much ſoever exerciſe do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe and confound the thoughts of Saints, ſo that they will be tempted with ſtrange thoughts and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of their lot, and of Gods dealing toward them; Yet when the cloud is over, they will recal theſe thoughts, and look as comfortably on the ſaddeſt of their lots as ever: So much alſo doth Chriſts experience teach, who in his exerciſe abhorred his ſuffering of the accurſed death, and the wrath of God; Yet now when he is calmed, he hath as ſweet thoughts of that lot as formerly he had, <hi>verſe</hi> 23 3. Such as would have their iſſues from trouble, and their exerciſe, bleſſed unto them, ought to make uſe thereof, and to emprove them to the beſt advantage, in their place and ſtation; for, herein Chriſt hath caſt us a copy, who being comforted, and getting a breathing time, doth fall a preaching againe, and communicates his conſolations to his hearers. 5. The beſt way of looking on our ſad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and ſtraits, is, to ponder the fruits that God will bring out of them, which may ſwallow up the bitterneſs and griefe they put us unto, and which we do pore too much upon; So Chriſt is comforted over the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the cup of his ſufferings, whereof he had a late taſte, by looking upon the fruit thereof. 6. By the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> this inferiour world is out of frame and in diſorder; Not only is the whole Creation groaning and travelling in pain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. but all mankinde by nature are lying in wickedneſſe, with their backs upon God, after whole image they were created; and ſinne and Satan are raging in them at their pleaſure, and making them fight againſt God with whom they were entered in a Covenant of friendſhip; for, ſo is here imported, that there is need of a <hi>judgement,</hi> or, reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>this world.</hi> 7. No mean that could be deviſed, beſide the death of Chriſt, was able to reforme this diſorder, nor can put in frame theſe things that are out of courſe; for, ſaith he, <hi>now,</hi> and by no other mean, <hi>is the judgement of this world.</hi> 8. Chriſt, by his death, hath reſtored the collapſed eſtate of this world. Albeit he permit the generallity of men to lye over in their loſt eſtate, as being debtor to none; Yet even they are judged, in ſo far as they are inſeparable from ſin which he deſtroyeth, and as their condemnation is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. But in reference to the elect world, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and ſubdued ſin (in the guilt, power, and effects thereof) and Satan which diſturb the world, and hath brought in righteouſneſſe, abſolved them, and aſſerted them into liberty in himſelfe: for, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the judgement of this world.</hi> 9. Albeit it be ſaid, that <hi>now,</hi> at Chriſts death, this judgement is paſſed; Yet it is not to be miſtaken, when even the converted elect finde ſin in its guilt and power, and Satan (of whom in the next part of this verſe) ſo prevalent and raging: For, (to clear what is already ſaid in the explication) Though the purchaſe be then made, and the application be begun at their converſion, yet the full poſſeſſion and victory is not attained till the end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55. 2. Whatever exerciſe it pleaſe the Lord to put them unto, yet the victory at laſt is ſure, this purchaſe being made. 3. The raging of ſin and Satan, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect feele and groan under, is an evidence they are caſt out; whereas otherwiſe, they would be at quiet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. 4. The reaſon why the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elect finde ſo little preſent fruit of this purchaſe, is, becauſe they make ſo little uſe of an intereſt in Chriſt by faith and of the conqueſt we have in him our head, as <hi>Rom</hi> 6.11. Thus are we to underſtand this purpoſe, <hi>Now is the judgement of this world. Doctrine</hi> 10. It makes up the great diſorder of this world, in reſpect of the Elect, that not only they are under the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but Satan alſo is daily blowing at the bellows of it, and himſelfe alſo immediately ſuggeſting wicked tentations; for, here it is added, as a great cauſe of this diſorder, that Satan is a <hi>Prince of this world,</hi> who muſt be <hi>caſt out,</hi> that this <hi>judgement</hi> may be. 11. Satan is a Prince and Ruler of theſe who live in ſin, not by any right, but by tyrannical uſurpation, who doth furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly drive them on in the ſervice of ſin; for, he is <hi>the Prince of this world.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. 12. Satan is an uſurper, who will not quit his poſſeſſion with good-will, unleſſe he be caſt out; for,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48148:133"/>
he muſt be <hi>caſt out;</hi> Where it is otherwiſe, and he but <hi>goeth out,</hi> he doth but deceive, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. 13. Chriſts death is Satans overthrow; Then did he ſpoile principalities and powers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. And the merit and efficacy of his death, will caſt him out of the Elect by degrees; for, <hi>now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out;</hi> Namely, out of his tyranical uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in the world, in relation to the Elect, and out of them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Elect, who are made partakers of Chriſts death, are in themſelves a great number, gathered out of all nations, and ſexes of people, and are Chriſts all, whom he careth for; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called <hi>all men.</hi> 2. Whatever be Chriſt; purpoſe of love toward the Elect, and his purchaſe for them; Yet in themſelves they are at a great diſtance from their happineſſe, till they be brought unto it; for, they are <hi>drawn to him,</hi> which imports a diſtance. 3. The Elect are not only far from Chriſt, but ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from their own happineſſe, and have ſo many impediments in their way, that they muſt be drawn to it, before they come; for, <hi>I will draw all men,</hi> ſaith he, compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. 4. Chriſt will not want his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, notwithſtanding all theſe impediments; his death doth purchaſe life to them, and his efficacious power will bring them to participate thereof; for, <hi>I will draw all men,</hi> ſaith he. 5. They, to whom Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the efficacy of his death, will finde no place of reſt, till they be brought to communion with him, and abide with him; And he will not give over perfecting their happineſſe and drawing them, till he bring them where he is; for, <hi>I will draw all men to me,</hi> that is, to communion with me through my death, and to be where I am. 6. Chriſts Croſſe will be glorious in their eyes who ſee the rich fruits thereof. Therefore doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, <hi>If I be lifted up from the earth</hi> (to wit, on the croſſe, alluding to the brazen ſerpent) as a glorious exaltation of him, when ſo many ſhould ſlow to a crucified Saviour. 7. Chriſt knew his own death and the manner of it, before he embraced it, and ſo he was not ſurprized with it, but made it his voluntary choice; for, he <hi>ſpake this,</hi> before hand, <hi>ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</hi> 8. Chriſts victories over ſin and Satan are glorious and remarkable, not only in themſelves, but alſo in the way and manner of them, that he ſhould overcome by ignominy, weakneſſe, ſuffering, and death; Therefore is the expoſition of this <hi>lifting up</hi> given, that we may ponder much this way of his ſucceſſe. 9. Chriſts words ought not only to be reverendly heard, but ſhould be marked and pondered, till they be underſtood; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> thinks it needful not to leave this one word uncleared.</p>

The errour and miſtake in all this objection, is, their not conſidering and diſtinguiſhing of two natures in Chriſts perſon, of both which the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

Likewiſe, their confounding his ſtate of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation unto the death with his ſtate of exaltation after his ſufferings; in which reſpect he abideth for ever. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſts ſweeteſt doctrine will not gain on wicked unbeleevers, but they will carp and ſtumble; Yea, they will rather voluntarily ſeek occaſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, then embrace and beleeve it; for, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt hath even now been owned from heaven, and his doctrine hath been moſt ſweet, yet <hi>the people anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> and objected againſt his doctrine. 2. Its a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and commendable duty in the members of the viſible Church, to be well acquaint with Scriptures, and to emprove all means for that end; for, albeit they be <hi>the people,</hi> or <hi>multitude,</hi> as the word ſignifies, yet they can give an account what they have <hi>heard out of the Law.</hi> Where, albeit the Scripture pointed at, be found in other places in the Old Teſtament, rather then in the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they call it <hi>the law,</hi> for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned on <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.34. And they mention only what they have <hi>heard</hi> out of it, either becauſe being unlearned, they had no means of inſtruction, but their hearing the Word read in their Synagogues, and yet they underſtand ſo much. Or, becauſe whatever other means of inſtruction they had, by their own reading, meditation, or conference; Yet they neglected not that ſpecial mean of edification by the publike Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. 3. It is from the Scriptures only, that contraverſes in Religion ought to be determined; for, they object nothing to determine this contraverſie, but what they <hi>heard out of the Law.</hi> 4. Mens knowledge and good parts will not lead them to beleeve in Chriſt, unleſſe they be ſanctified; But will rather furniſh them with weapons, wherewith to oppoſe him and his truth; For, theſe are men who underſtand Chriſts language of <hi>lifting up,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> thinks needful to explain, <hi>ver.</hi> 32.33. And who are well verſed in the Scriptures; and yet all the uſe they make hereof, is to carp and quarrel. 5. It is the great comfort of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that the Meſſiah endureth for ever, to apply his own purchaſe, and interceed for them, and to make them eternally happy with himſelfe, who is the eternal and alſufficient God: Therefore was this ſweet doctrine regiſtrate in <hi>the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 6. Chriſts lifting up by death, and his abiding for ever, do very well conſiſt together, if rightly underſtood; for, both theſe are true of him, when the Law ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt abideth for ever,</hi> and when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

See alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.42, 43. and elſewhere; Which as they may be eaſily reconciled; By conſidering that he is true God, and true man, in one perſon; By diſtinguiſhing betwixt his ſtate of humiliation and of glory, and betwixt the carnal look that wicked men take of him, and the ſpiritual look of right diſcerners: So they are very comfortable to ſtudy. For hereby is held out how low he ſtooped to reach ſinners, and yet how high he is, that he may exalt them. Thus alſo do the Scriptures ſpeak of his Church and her conditions in different, and ſeeming contrary, tearms, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. and elſewhere; which alſo are eaſily reconciled, by diſtinguiſhing betwixt the worlds thoughts, (and ſometime her own alſo) of her, and Gods thoughts of her; Betwixt what ſhe is in her ſelfe, and what ſhe is in her head: and, betwixt what her conditions are, and do portend in themſelves, and what Chriſt brings out of them. 7. As all erroneous perſons do ſeek patrociny for their errours in Scripture, (as here they do) So a ſpecial mean of deluding ſouls, and breeding errour, is, when they look on one parcel of Scripture, without ſearching into it (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39) or comparing it with other Scriptures, which might illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and clear it; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.) for, ſo do they run upon errour, by fixing only on ſuch Scriptures as ſpake of the <hi>Meſſiah's abiding for ever,</hi> never looking to theſe which ſpake as clearly of his ſufferings, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. throughout, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. and frequently. 8. Such members of the viſible Church as are not acquaint with ſoul-miſery, and are prepoſſeſſed with carnal deluſions and fancies concerning Chriſt and his Kingdome, will eaſily fall in errours, concerning him, were the contrary truths never ſo clear in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, this was another occaſion of their errour. Albeit other Scriptures might have cleared this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and theſe people generally knew the Scriptures exactly; Yet becauſe, not only they were not exerciſed under the ſenſe of miſery, needing a ſuffering Saviour (which is an uſual companion of deluſion,) but, their heads were filled with a dream of the carnal glory of his Kingdome; Therefore this blinded their eyes, that they ſaw not, or conſidered not theſe other Scriptures. This alſo for a time blinded the diſciples eyes, that they little pondered the doctrine of Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.18, 19, with <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Yea, and underſtood it not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.31, 32, 33, 34. 9. It is an evidence of an impenitent, unhumbled, and wicked diſpoſition in men, when they think baſely of a ſuffering Chriſt, and of his humiliation and death; for, ſuch is their temper here, in enquiring ſo diſdainfully, <hi>who is this Sonne of man?</hi> and that becauſe he <hi>muſt be lift up.</hi> 10. Ignorance er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and deluſion, are ordinarily accompanied with much pride and conceit; for, ſo was it with theſe here. They think they have reaſoned ſo ſtrongly out of the Law, againſt his doctrine of the Sonne of mans ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they inſultingly conclude, <hi>who is this Sonne of man?</hi> As if they ſaid; We have undeniably argued, that though the Sonne of man cannot be the Meſſiah, be what thou wilt: For, by thy own confeſſion thou muſt dye, and by the Law Chriſt abides for ever. Thus 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4, pride is joined with errour, and <hi>knowing nothing,</hi> and with <hi>doting,</hi> about idle queſtions, which is an uſual mark of deluſion.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have Chriſts anſwer unto, and carriage upon, this objection, ſo cloſing this whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And firſt, He will not anſwer any more directly to their cavilling objection, nor will he inſiſt to clear how his ſuffering and abiding for ever are conſiſtent, having already abundantly cleared all doubts, by his former doctrine and miracles. Only he indirectly points at what his former doctrine and miracles had proven; To wit, that he is the Meſſiah and light of the world, (of which we heard, <hi>chap</hi> 8.12.) And that by his doctrine and Miniſtry they had the true means of grace to direct them to heaven. And preſſeth upon them to walk in that light, rather then to bark againſt it, which afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. he expounds to be their beleeving in him, and anſwerable walking. Secondly, He ſubjoines reaſons to enforce this exhortation. As, 1. They were to have but a little while of this light, his perſon firſt, and then the Goſpel holding him out, being to be removed from them; And therefore they had need to emprove the opportunity better, then to carp and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute themſelves from their happineſſe. 2. Upon the removal of this light, darkneſſe of ignorance and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would follow, and then they ſhould wander like men in the dark. 3. If they beleeve and walk in the light, they ſhall be the children of light, and his true followers. And by theſe ſubjoined to the exhortation, he clears alſo that, however it be a truth, that he is to abide for ever, yet not as they underſtood it.

Thirdly, Chriſt having ſaid this, leaves off his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gets away from them. This he did, partly, to avoid danger, becauſe he ſaw them begin to heat againſt him, and knew that his enemies were waiting for his life: And partly, to begin the verification of that threatning of the lights departing from them. And however Chriſt preached and debated much in publike, at this his laſt entry to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is noted by the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; yet not much after this. And however it was, yet <hi>John</hi> mentions no more of his publike preaching after this, ſave only a little in the cloſe of this Chapter.

Albeit Chriſt be very tender of weak ones, who wander, and hath commanded that they be inſtructed in meekneſſe who oppoſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. Yet when he hath clearly confirmed his truth, he looks upon the continued carpings of men, as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their malicious diſpoſition, which is neither to be dallied nor debated with: Therefore will he not inſiſt to anſwer to their cavil and objection, but puts them to their duty upon their peril. 2. As cavillations and diſputes againſt the truth are an evidence that mens hearts are dead, and that they are idle in point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; So the beſt way of dealing with ſuch, after the truth is cleared, is, to preſſe the practice of godlineſſe upon them, and to let them ſee the danger of oppoſing that truth upon which they ſhould be feeding; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he, inſtead of anſwering, preſſe them to <hi>walk while they have the light,</hi> and points out the hazard of their ill emproving of their time 3. As Chriſt is the true light of the world, however he be deſpiſed by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; Somers ſleighting of him doth not diminiſh his eſtimation of his own worth, nor ſhould beleevers think the leſſe of him; for, whatever their cavillations were, he propoſeth himſelfe to be eſteemed of as <hi>the light.</hi> 4. So long as men enjoy Chriſt and the means of grace, they enjoy light and a ſweet eſtate, if it be well emproven, be their outward condition never ſo ſad; for, it may ſtill be ſaid in ſuch a caſe, <hi>the light is with you.</hi> 5.

Albeit Chriſt will not at firſt give up with deſpiſers; Yet when men who enjoy the means, in ſtead of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thereof, do fall a wearying of, and carping at truth, it is a token they will enjoy them but ſhort while, unleſſe they repent; for, unto theſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And however the Lord continue them with ſuch for a time, yet they may be ſo hardened, as not to profit thereby. 7. It may ſtir up men to emprove the opportunity of the means of grace, when they conſider, how ſhort while they may enjoy them, and that their neglecting of the opportunity may ſhorten it; for, it clearly followeth <hi>yet a little while is the light with you,</hi> therefore <hi>walk while ye have the light.</hi> 8. Such as do rightly emprove an offer of Chriſt, and the means of grace, will be ſo far from carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereat, that they will not reſt ſatisfied with any notional eſtimation thereof, unleſſe they reduce their knowledge into practice, and in the uſe of means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in their way to heaven; for, it is required, they <hi>walk while they have the light</hi> as men make uſe of the day-light, to do their buſineſſe or travel in. 9.

As it is the great mercy of thoſe who enjoy and emprove the Goſpel, that they know what they are doing, and what to do in every condition, (for, they are as men in day light, who ſee their way), So it is a ſad judgement on deſpiſers, who provoke God to take away the means, that they wander in darkneſſe, ſtumbling on ſinful courſes, and walking by gueſſe in very ſtep, and that in affliction they know not whither to turn them; for, ſo much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this reaſon, <hi>for he that walketh in darkneſſe, knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Sinners can never enough be admoniſhed of, or ponder the danger of their neglecting an opportunity of the means of grace, and their duty to make uſe of it; Therefore doth Chriſt again repeat the exhortation, inſinuating the ſhort time they were like to have the opportunity, <hi>while ye have the light, beleeve in the light,</hi> 2. Before there can be any anſwerable walking to an offer of Chriſt, or any uſe made of truth, uſe muſt be made of faith to cloſe with the truth, and with Chriſt offered in it; Therefore, is their <hi>walking,</hi> expounded here, <hi>beleeve in the light,</hi> or the truth of the Goſpel, and in Chriſt ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it. 3. Such as make uſe of the means of grace, do reap fair advantage thereby, in getting, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing a good condition; for, they are to do this, <hi>that ye may be the children of light.</hi> A name given to Saints, <hi>Luk</hi> 16.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. and elſewhere; And the meaning of this encouragement, is. That by emproving this opportunity, they ſhall be tranſlated out of the power of darkneſſe, into the Kingdome of Chriſt, which is a Kingdome of light; They ſhall become the Sonnes of God, who is <hi>the Father of lights, Jam.</hi> 1.17. and participate of ſweet effects of Chriſts being the light of the world; And, by ſo doing, they ſhall alſo evidence themſelves to be children of light, illuminated by divine light, to diſcern right and wrong, what is their true happineſſe, and real miſery; to be men who come to the light with their actions, and who are thirſting after that eternal light of glory. 4. Chriſt is not only terrible, but even meek alſo to his oppoſers, if they would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him; And all his ſcope in ſhewing himſelfe terrible, is, to drive them to his mercy, and to partake of the fruits of his meekneſſe; for, all his threatnings are ſweetned with this, that his ſcope in them is, to drive them to duty, that <hi>they may be children of light.</hi> 5. There is hope, even concerning thoſe who wickedly oppoſe Chriſt and his truth, that they may partake of his mercy, if they will caſt away their weapons, and ſubmit; for, even to ſuch it is offered here, that if they will do duty, <hi>they may be the children of light.</hi> 6. It is needful not only to deal freely with wicked oppoſers, but to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them alſo, to ſee what that may work; for, <hi>theſe things ſaid Jeſus, and departed,</hi> that is, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at night to <hi>Bethany,</hi> as the other Evangeliſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and by this means alſo he did avoid their fury and plots within the City. 7. Convictions and offers do oft-times ſo little prevail with wicked men that they do but heighten their malice; for, Chriſt behooved to <hi>hide</hi> himſelfe, after this doctrine. 8. In caſes of hazard from malicious men, it is lawful to preſerve our own
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48148:134"/>
lives, by ordinary and lawful means; for, Jeſus <hi>hid himſelfe from them.</hi> 9. Chriſts ſervants muſt not weary of frequency of trials, in diſcharge of their duty; and to be put to it again and again, even to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from extream violence; for, Chriſt hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this lot in his own perſon, who was often put to hide himſelfe.</p>

Who were either wicked misbeleevers, and were nothing moved with his doctrine and miracles, but rather hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, as had been forepropheſied,</hi> to ver. 42. <hi>or hidden and timorous friends, who for carnal reſpects durſt not avow or confeſſe him,</hi> ver. 42, 43. <hi>And unto this he ſubjoins Chriſts farewell-Sermon to them,</hi> ver. 44, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In theſe verſes is recorded. 1. The open incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the moſt part of his hearers. 2. An aggravation of this fault, from the great diligence uſed to draw them to him, not only by doctrine, but by miracles, which they ſo much ſought after. 3. This is illuſtrate by comparing this event with a foregoing prophecy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. For clearing whereof, and the citation of it in this place, Conſider. 1. This prophecy is applied to Chriſts Miniſtry, not as if it had no accompliſhment in others: for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes mention of <hi>our report;</hi> which includes both himſelf and his fellow Prophets, who did publiſh and fore-propheſie of the Goſpel; and Chriſts Apoſtles and Miniſters alſo, <hi>Rom</hi> 10 15.16. But the meaning is; That as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his time, preaching of Chriſt, had cauſe to complain of bad ſucceſſe, ſo his complaint is alſo a prediction of the like ſucceſſe of Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Miniſters; in the dayes of the Goſpel. Conſider. 2. This their carriage is compared with the prediction, and they are ſaid not to beleeve, <hi>that the ſaying of Eſaias might be fulfilled,</hi> not to free them from the ſin and guilt of their unbelief, nor doth it hold out that this prediction was a cauſe thereof, or that God by foretelling thereof, had any ſinful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in producing their unbelief. But it tends to ſhew that the event came to paſſe according to the prediction: and by comparing the prediction with the event, he would, partly, point out the abſolute and holy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, without which nothing comes to paſſe, either acting or permitting it, and therefore he can foretel it ſo long before hand: And partly, he would prevent the ſtumbling of others at Chriſt and the Goſpel, by occaſion of the Jewes rejecting of him; Seeing this was rather a proofe, that he was the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, of whom it was forepropheſied that he ſhould be rejected by them. Conſider. 3. As for the citation it ſelf, it contains a propoſition of their fault, in a ſad complaint, that few or none gave credite to the report of the Goſpel; And an explication and amplification hereof; wherein. 1.

Their unbelief is illuſtrate from a negative cauſe thereof, to wit, that this <hi>arme of the Lord is not revealed to them,</hi> Namely, inwardly and effectually, for otherwiſe they did hear it.

                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 37. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

The fruit of the Goſpel which Chriſt requires, is, that men take him up, who is offered there, what he is, and by faith cloſe with him and make uſe of him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; for, this is the fruit he miſſeth <hi>they beleeved not on him.</hi> 3. It is the judgment of the Lord upon the world, that the offer of Chriſt in his Goſpel doth not work upon the moſt part of hearers, and moſt faithful labourers do miſſe the fruits of their labours among them; for, notwithſtanding Chriſts pains, <hi>yet they</hi> (generally) <hi>beleeved not on him.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.16, 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5. 4 The great pains taken upon men contributes to aggravate the ſinne of their obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; for, ſo is their ſin agreaged here, <hi>Though he had done ſo many miracles before them, yet they beleeved not.</hi> Theſe miracles were many in number, great in their nature, (as the Word will alſo bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The meane whereby ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are brought to faith in Chriſt, is, their receiving and cloſing with the report of the Word concerning themſelves and him, in the mouth of ſent meſſengers; for, herein conſiſted their not beleeving on him, that they <hi>beleeved not our report.</hi> 2.

Whatever other duties be required of Miniſters, who are ſenſible of the unfruitfulneſs of their Miniſtry; It is alſo required, that they comfort themſelves in this, that the holy and ſoveraigne good pleaſure of God is ſtill accompliſhed by the Miniſtry of the Word; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this prediction pointed at, as a ſpecial mean to comfort Miniſters, when they ſee that things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God foretold they ſhould be. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. 10. However un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers may think to affront Chriſt, by their rejecting of him; Yet he will be diſappointed by none of them, and he will emprove their oppoſition to ſpecial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: Therefore alſo is this prophecy cited, to ſhew that he knew well enough what they would prove, even long before they were, and that their not beleeving in him was an evidence he was the true Meſſiah, as hath been cleared. 11. God hath an holy Providence, even about things that come to paſs by contingent ſecond cauſes, and depend upon mens free will; for, he can foretell them here before they come to paſs. 12. Gods Providence is ſo infallible, that he will not be fruſtrate of his purpoſes; And an argument from the prediction of his Word concerning any thing, is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it will come to paſſe; for, here the event an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth exactly to the prediction. 13. Whatever be the providence of God about ſinful men, and their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; Yet God and his providence are wholly free of blame (He being the ſoveraigne Lord, above the Laws given to his creatures, bound to none, and not concurrent in the wickedneſs of their actions) and the guilt is wholly the ſinners, as being under the Law, and voluntarily chooſing the wicked courſe which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Therefore, albeit it be declared here, that Gods providence had an hand in this buſineſs, yet both in the prediction it is propounded by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and here, by way of chalenge againſt ſuch ſinners.</p>

And albeit the other places adde the <hi>making their cares heavy,</hi> or <hi>dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to the other two here mentioned; Yet the ſcope of theſe places and this is the ſame, to ſhew that all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were obſtructed, whereby the Word might enter, to work converſion which brings ſalvation and healing with it. And for the words here in particular, albeit their <hi>not underſtanding with their heart,</hi> may ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that their <hi>heart</hi> is to be underſtood of their minde and underſtanding, and the ſame with <hi>their eyes,</hi> not bodily, but inward; And ſo the plague of blinding their eyes, and hardening their heart ſhall be the ſame: Yet it is more full and clear to underſtand the words of diſtinct plagues on the ſeveral faculties of their ſoul, that the eyes of their minde were blinded, and their will (ſignified by their <hi>heart</hi>) hardened. And ſo their <hi>not underſtanding,</hi> added to their <hi>not ſeeing,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not of a ſimple act of knowledge, but ſuch an underſtanding as produceth ſutable effects upon the will and affections, to work converſion, which is ſubjoyned to it: And ſo, to <hi>underſtand,</hi> ſignifieth frequently ſo to know a thing, as to approve and eſteeme of it, to be affected with it, or drawn to the enjoyment of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 4. As for the author and efficient of theſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48148:135"/>
plagues, if we compare the places before cited, we will finde divers named, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and <hi>Acts</hi> 28. <hi>the cloſing of the eyes</hi> (and conſequently the reſt) is aſcribed unto the ſinners themſelves. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. The Prophet is ſent out to <hi>make their heart fat,</hi> &amp;c. And here it is aſcribed to Chriſt, even to him whoſe glory <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. who in the beginning of this verſe is ſpoken of in the third perſon, and in the end thereof, ſpeaks of himſelf in the firſt perſon, as is uſual in the Scripture. Theſe are eaſily reconciled; for as men do ſinfully har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves, ſo the Lord by a judicial ſtroak gives them up thereunto as a puniſhment, and the Meſſengers of Chriſt do not only carry and intimate this ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but their doctrine is an occaſion of mens ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and hardning of themſelves, as it is of hewing and ſlaying, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. Conſider, 5. As for this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial act of God, in blinding and hardning ſinners, that we may underſtand it rightly. 1. As we muſt not conceive that God doth approve this ſinful hardneſs and blindneſs in men, though, as a juſt judge, he inflict the puniſhment; So we are not to conceive of it, as if he made them blinde who did ſee, or hardened them who were ſoft and tender, but that by witholding of his grace (which he is bound to give to none) he leaves them to their own blindneſs and hardneſs, or gives them up to augment it, which is moſt properly a puniſhment. 2. This judicial blinding and hardning of ſinners, here mentioned, may be called Gods act, partly, in ſo far as he ſent to them the preaching of the Goſpel, which was an occaſion they took hold of to harden and blind themſelves, through the irritation of their corruptions thereby; And, partly, in that, to puniſh this their abuſe, he witholds his efficacious grace, gives them to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde, and to the power of Satan, to harden and blinde them more and more. And this exhauſts the meaning in this place, that as they were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and blinded by Chriſts doctrine and miracles, ſo he gave them up to be puniſhed with more and more of it.</p>
                  <p>From this purpoſe thus explained, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men by nature are lying in a woful and miſerable deadly condition, full of deadly wounds and ſores; for, they need to be <hi>healed.</hi> 2. Whatever courſe men take to rid themſelves of their miſeries, yet there is no curing of their ſores, till God put to his hand; for, it is <hi>I</hi> that muſt <hi>heal them.</hi> 3. However men flatter themſelves, yet none are indeed cured of theſe diſeaſes by God, but they who finde grace to turn to him by true regeneration and repentance; which is the only way to cure their ſoul diſeaſes, to ſanctifie and ſweeten their other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to enſure eternal ſalvation to them; for, this, and this only, is the way, that <hi>they be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> 4.

                  <p>In theſe verſes is recorded Chriſts ſucceſſe among another ſort of hearers, even hid and timorous friends, and theſe of chief rank. Of theſe it is ſaid. 1. That though they did indeed beleeve, yet they durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, nor avow Chriſt. 2. That the impediment hindering them, was fear of excommunication from the Phariſees. 3. That the reaſon why this was an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, was their love of credite and applauſe among men, which they, in this particular, preferred to the approbation of God. Which albeit where it beareth full ſwey, is an invincible impediment to grace, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.44. Yet prevailing here but in part, and being only in one particular of not confeſſion, it doth not anul the reality of their grace, though it prove the great weakneſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 42. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even in times of greateſt obſtinacy, and where the Word comes worſt ſpeed, the Miniſtry will ſtill have ſome ſucceſſe, and not be in vain; Therefore is it declared, that in this time, Chriſt had ſome hidden ones (beſide his own flock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and avowed him) who <hi>beleeved on him,</hi> when the generality were hardened. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.4. 2. Chriſt is ſo powerful in the Miniſtry of his Word, that he will (when he pleaſeth) work upon them who have many impediments in their way, and who are amongſt the moſt bitter enemies to him; for, <hi>among the chief rulers alſo</hi> (who were bitter enemies to Chriſt) <hi>many beleeved on him.</hi> And albeit they were under ſo many tentations, that they durſt not confeſs him; yet they are made to beleeve. 3. Albeit the converſion of any be a work of omnipotency; yet the converſion of the greater ſort of men, who have ſo many tentations and impediments in their way, is more to be admired then the bringing in of the meaner ſort, eſpecially in corrupt times of the Church; Therefore is it eſpecially marked, that <hi>among the chief rulers alſo, many beleeved on him.</hi> 4. There may be true faith and grace, where yet there is much infirmity, to ſmother and bear it down; for, they <hi>beleeved on him,</hi> though they durſt not avow it. This ought not to make men flatter themſelves in their weakneſs, but ſhould teach others to be charitable, and to encourage and ſtir up ſuch to be more ſtrong, having ſuch a ſeed in them as will prevail, and not to weaken their hands from duty, by thinking they are graceleſſe, becauſe they are weak. 5. Faith is in a very weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when confeſſion is not joyned with it, and when men do not profeſſe Chriſt and the true Religion, nor avow him in troublous times, and by their converſation lift not up a banner, profeſſing that they are his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; for, this was the infirmity of their faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they <hi>beleeved on him, yet they did not confeſſe him.</hi> Albeit a bate outſide profeſſion be to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet if it be well grounded, it is commendable, and as neceſſary in its own kinde, as beleeving is in its kinde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. 6. Carnal fear of men, and danger from them, is a great impediment to the avowing of Chriſt; for, <hi>becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him.</hi> Albeit they were not ſo powerful againſt Chriſt, as to hinder their heart from beleeving, yet they deterred them from confeſſing with their mouths. This is an impediment to be removed by truſt in God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. and by the fear of his dreadfulneſſe, <hi>Matth</hi> 10.28. 7. It is a great judgement, and an evidence of great wickedneſs in men, when not only men will not come to Chriſt themſelves, but they are a terrour to all theſe who would embrace and avow him; for, ſuch were <hi>the Phariſees</hi> here, <hi>becauſe of whom they did not confeſſe him.</hi> See <hi>Matth,</hi> 23.13. 8. Albeit all men are naturally affraid to hazard any thing for Chriſt; Yet, ordinarily, fear prevails moſt with them who are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and have moſt to looſe; for, it was <hi>the chief rulers,</hi> who, <hi>becauſe of the Phariſees, did not confeſſe him,</hi> leſt they ſhould loſe their place and reputation; But it was otherwiſe with the blinde man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.30. — 34. 9. Excommunication is a divine Ordinance in the houſe of God, and which was in force in the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt times of the Jewiſh Church; As, here, they kept it in uſe, to <hi>put men out of the Synagogue,</hi> of which we have ſpoken formerly. 10. Not only mean perſons, but profeſſours of greateſt rank and place in the Church, are ſubject to the cenſure of excommunication, and it may juſtly be inflicted, upon their miſcarriage; for, herein alſo they followed the rule, that even <hi>the chief rulers</hi> were kept under hazard of being <hi>put out of the Synagogue.</hi> 11. In corrupt times of the Church, Chriſts Ordinances are all abuſed, and the edge of cenſures turned againſt him and his followers; for, ſo was it here, they who did <hi>confeſs Chriſt</hi> were in hazard to <hi>be put out of the Synagogue.</hi> 12. Excommunication is in it ſelfe a dreadful cenſure, and ought to be eſteemed ſo by all Church members, albeit the inflicting thereof injuſtly ought not to terrifie men from duty; for, it was their carnal fear that made them ſhrink from duty, leſt the Phariſees ſhould injuſtly inflict it, yet their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, though chief Rulers, teſtifies how much that cenſure in it ſelfe was feared in that Church.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 43. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough to ſee the evils into which men break out and fall, unleſs alſo the cauſes drawing on this evil be ſeen and diſcovered; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> ſearch into the fountain-cauſe driving them on this ſnare. 2. Shame and diſreſpect for Chriſts cauſe, is true glory and honour in Gods account; for, it is ſuppoſed that if they had loſt <hi>the praiſe of men,</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:48148:136"/>
it had been their <hi>praiſe from God.</hi> 3. There is no greater ſnare to draw a man from duty, then inordinate affection to his credite and reputation; for, if all other loſſes they might have ſuſtained, this intangled them moſt, that they would looſe <hi>the praiſe of men.</hi> 4. Selfe love, and ſelfe-ſeeking, and hunting after credite and applauſe, are evils ſo dear to men, and ſo deeply rooted in them, that even beleevers may be overpowered by ſtrong remainders thereof, even ſometime to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of Gods teſtimony and approbation; for, even they who <hi>beleeved on him,</hi> ver. 42. yet <hi>loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God.</hi> 5. So long as men let thoughts of earthly credite and reputation ſwallow up the thoughts of divine approbation and praiſe, they will never clearly avow Chriſt and his truth, in a time of trial; for, <hi>they did not confeſſe him,</hi> ver. 42 <hi>for, they loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God.</hi> Whereas the more men ſtudy to approve themſelves to God, and reſt in his approbation, the more vile will this worlds praiſe grow in their eyes, and it will ſtumble them the leſs to want it. 6. Such as are taken up with their credite, and with applauſe from men, neglecting Gods approbation, they do make a very poor choice, and loſe more then they can gain; for, it is inſinuate, as their fault and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the whole purpoſe may be taken up in ſeveral arguments, pleading againſt the unbelief of many, and the faintheartedneſs of beleevers, who did not confeſs him.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es the importance of this ſubject, that they ſhould beleeve in him, however they ſleighted it, and avows his zeal in this matter, when others hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The ſecond argument (in this verſe alſo) points out the advantage of faith from the object thereof, who is God. They who beleeve on him, beleeve not on him, but on him who ſent him: which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſimply, that Chriſt is not the object of faith, but with relation to their conceptions of Chriſt, as a meer man, and oppoſite to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d: and ſo the meaning is; That which he calls them unto, is not a faith in him as man, but a faith in God, and not a faith in him only, but a faith in the Father alſo, who is in Chriſt, and one and the ſame God with him, as the following verſe cleareth. And ſo the encouragement is, That be being true God, equal and one in eſſence with the Father, their faith in beleeving on him, ſhould be in God, and they ſhould finde the Father in him, which might both ſtir up the unbeliever to beleeve, and the fainthearted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, to avow him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

                  <p>In this verſe we have a confirmation of the ſecond argument, that beleevers in Chriſt beleeve on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; ſhewing, that Chriſt being one, not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in eſſence, with the Father, none can ſee him ſpiritually and by faith, but they muſt ſee the Father alſo, not only with him, but in him, and one with him, as being <hi>the brightneſſe of his glory, and expreſſe image of

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third argument pleading againſt theſe evils, is taken from the fruit and utility following on faith in him; to wit, That he coming to be the light of the world, beleevers in him will partake thereof, and not abide in darkneſs: of which we have had occaſion to ſpeak before. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The world without Chriſt is lying under the power of darkneſſe, both of ignorance and wickedneſſe, and all miſeries following thereupon, for, <hi>the world</hi> needs <hi>light.</hi> 2. Chriſt is the diſcoverer of mens miſery, and of the remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; is the true cordial &amp; comfort of ſinners againſt all their miſeries; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am come a light into the world</hi> 3.

Whatever be the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come on theſe who hear not the Goſpel, yet their danger is by far greateſt, who hear and obey not; for, this threatning is againſt them who <hi>hear Chriſts words.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.22. 4.

Albeit Chriſt be alwayes Judge of the world, yet in his firſt coming, he laid aſide the perſon of a Judge, and took on the office of a Mediatour and Saviour, to offer and purchaſe mercy; for, <hi>I judge him not; for, I came not to judge the world. but to ſave the world.</hi> 7.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48148:137"/>
and Chriſt in it; for, ſo, <hi>not to beleeve,</hi> ver. 47. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>he rejects me, and receiveth not my words.</hi> 3. It is not their ſin who are ſtudying to beleeve and yet are kept wreſtling under the power of unbelief, that Chriſt will bring into judgement; but the ſin of theſe who care not to beleeve; for, ſuch are to be judged here, <hi>who reject me,</hi> &amp;c. 4. It is a ſad plague on wicked unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers who hear the Goſpel, that their unbelief is joined with diſdain to Chriſt, and contempt of his Goſpel and grace; and that Chriſt will ſo judge of it; for, ſo Chriſt calls it here, <hi>he that rejecteth me</hi> (with contempt and diſdain, chooſing other things before me, as the Word imports) and <hi>receiveth not my words,</hi> not accounting them worthy to have any place with him. 5. Albeit ſin be not ſoon puniſhed; yea, albeit Chriſt be the Mediatour of ſinners; yet ſuch as deſpiſe him, he will not keep them from judgement; for, ſuch a man <hi>hath one that judgeth him,</hi> whereby is meant, not ſo much that the Father doth judge them, though the Son at his firſt coming, do not, as that certainly they will not eſcape a Judge and judgement, as is after cleared. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11, 12. 6. However the Lord deal with men here, and however in his forbearance they may eſcape judgement; Yet they will not eſcape the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt day, which will ſadly enough compenſe all delayes; for, <hi>he ſhall be judged in the laſt day.</hi> 7. Albeit in the day of judgement, wicked men will be called to an account for all their ſins againſt the Law; Yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Goſpel will be their ſaddeſt dittay; for, <hi>he that rejecteth me, the word that I have ſpoken ſhall judge him,</hi> that is, the Word of the Goſpel delivered by Chriſt, in whoſe mouth ſoever it be, though it will have its own peculiar weight againſt theſe who heard him, that he came and ſpake it himſelfe. 8. Though all other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt a wicked man were gone; yet the Word preached will ſtand up againſt him, as a witneſs and dittay in the great day: for, <hi>the word ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> It ſhall be a witneſs of what was offered, and make up a dittay againſt him for his contempt, upon which Chriſt ſhall pronounce ſentence. 9. The Word of God is ſo ſure and infallibly, that Chriſts ſentence in the great day (when heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away) ſhall proceed according to the verdict and teſtimony thereof; for, <hi>the word that I have ſpaken, ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> Chriſt will pronounce then according to what it ſayeth now, and that as well in favours of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as againſt unbeleevers.</p>

                  <p>The laſt argument ſerves to confirme and clear the former, and is taken from the authority of his doctrine. For, whereas they might except, that they were not afraid of his words, as being only his own. He anſwers, that he ſpake not of himſelfe, but what was the Fathers word alſo, And to confirme this, 1. He declareth that he had received a commiſſion from the Father who ſent him, concerning his doctrine, and what to ſay and ſpeak. 2. That he was perſwaded this doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by the Father, points out the true way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. 3. That he had exactly followed this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in preaching, both for matter and manner. Hence the argument concludes ſtrongly two wayes. 1. That his Word and doctrine being divine, and the Fathers as well as his, it was ſufficient to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all deſpiſers. 2. That his doctrine only pointing out the true way to life, and means of attaining it, they could not miſſe condemnation who would not hearken unto it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſts doctrine be his own, as he is true God and the wiſdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Yet it is not his own, as meer man, nor as ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father, who is one God with him, and who gave him a commiſſion and inſtructions as Mediatour; for, <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelfe, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a commandment,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the authour and approver of Chriſts doctrine, no leſſe then Chriſt himſelfe; for, <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> 3. No word, but Gods Word, is ſufficient to condemne men for diſobedience; and if men cannot prove their doctrine to be divine, it is neither to be obeyed, nor are terrours for the neglect thereof to be regarded; Therefore Chriſt takes this as the proofe that his Word ſhall judge men, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>for, I have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of my ſelfe, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a commandment, what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi> And this he exactly followed, as <hi>ver.</hi> 50. The two words, of <hi>ſaying,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> may be taken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively, as pointing out all the wayes of delivering his commiſſion, by ſet and ſolemne preaching, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional conferences; and the whole ſubject matter of his preaching, in precepts, promiſes and threatnings. And ſo it will import, that his commiſſion from the Father was full, both for matter and manner, and his diſcharge thereof anſwerable. Yet this variety of expreſſion is not to be inſiſted on, ſeeing in the following verſe Chriſt uſeth one of the words in place of both. 4. When men ſpeak by commiſſion from another, and according thereunto, the refuſer of the meſſage muſt be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Authour and ſender thereof; for, ſo doth Chriſt prove his Word ſhould judge them, ſeeing God is the author thereof, who will call them to an account. 5. The ſumme of Chriſts doctrine, which he delivered from the Father, is, to point out eternal life to loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the way and means leading thereunto; for, <hi>his commandment</hi> (or the doctrine, which I, at his command, have preached) <hi>is life everlaſting.</hi> See <hi>Joh</hi> 17.3. 6. Whatever eſteeme ſinners have of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; yet it is ſure in it ſelfe that there is no ſalvation by any other way or doctrine, but by embracing thereof; and as Chriſt is, ſo every Preacher ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the excellency thereof; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, in oppoſition to all their miſconſtructions, <hi>I know that his commandment is life everlaſting.</hi> 7. Chriſt is a true Prophet, who ſpake neither more or leſſe in the doctrine of the Goſpel, then what was the Fathers will ſhould be delivered to us; for, <hi>whatſoever I ſpeak, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> 8. It is the duty of the Meſſengers of the Goſpel to cleave
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48148:138"/>
cloſe to their commiſſion, without adding or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, herein Chriſts practice is a pattern of their duty. 9. Such as are perſwaded of the excellency and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of the Goſpel, will cleave to it, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it in their ſtations, were their diſcouragements ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many, or the oppoſition made to them never ſo great; for, upon this, <hi>I know that his commandment is life everlaſting,</hi> Chriſt inferreth this by way of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>whatever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid to me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> Intimating that upon this knowledge of the worth of his doctrine, he cleaves to it, and ſpeaks it, however they contemned him and it.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe we have recorded, a more general deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the time, that it was before the feaſt of the Paſſeover; together with the firſt and chiefe cauſe and conſideration leading Chriſt to this practice, and what followed; Namely, that he did conſtantly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably love his own, and therefore, knowing that now his time to depart from them was approaching at this feaſt, he was reſolving beforehand to give them ſome ample proofe of his love, as accordingly he did in waſhing their feet, preaching ſweetly unto them, and praying for them. For clearing the words, Conſider, 1. While <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that this was <hi>before the feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi> it was not ſo to be underſtood, as if this were done before the feaſt, for that <hi>ſupper,</hi> ver. 2. after which he waſhed their feet, was the paſſeover. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; That he was thinking and reſolving on this practice before he ſate down, either that ſame day, or poſſibly ſome daies before: And, that albeit it was done at the ſupper of the paſſeover, yet it was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the feaſt of unleavened bread at the paſſeover, which began the day following, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.5, 6, 7. yea, and before the day which the Jewes obſerved for eating the paſſeover, as we will hear on <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Conſider, 2. Whereas this love of Chriſt toward his own, breaks forth in theſe ſweet effects toward the diſciples only; Yet in this they are not to be looked on as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual men, nor as Apoſtles, nor yet as repreſenting Miniſters only, but alſo as repreſenting all Chriſts true children, who are edified and comforted by what he did to them, and whoſe allowance and legacy Chriſt did here commit to his Apoſtles in their name, as to the general Teachers of his Church, to be by them and their ſucceſſours publiſhed to his own throughout the world. And therefore the denomination is general, <hi>his own,</hi> that every one who make ſure an intereſt in him, may put in their own name. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. As Chriſt came into this world, to work the work of redemption; ſo there was a ſet time wherein he departed out of it, in reſpect of his bodily preſence; for, there is an <hi>hour,</hi> wherein <hi>he ſhould depart out of this world.</hi> 2. Chriſt chooſed the time of the Jewiſh paſſeover to ſuffer in, that he might prove himſelfe to be the ſubſtance of that type, whoſe blood it is that delivers us from the deſtroying Angel, and by whoſe obedience unto death we are delivered from the bondage of ſin, the tyrany of Satan, and the leaven of corruption and unſoundneſs, anſwerable to the temporal delivery of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and their obſervation of the feaſt with unleavened bread; Therefore it is marked that at <hi>the feaſt of the Paſſeover, his hour was come wherein he ſhould depart out of this world.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. 3. Chriſt was not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with his ſufferings, nor were they carried out according to the will of enemies; But the time thereof was determined, and he knew of it before hand: for, <hi>Jeſus knew that his hour was come.</hi> 4. Chriſt may be truſted by his people, and they may commit all their lots to him, who is on all his Fathers counſels, and knows all the machinations of his enemies; Therefore is he

pointed out here, as knowing all that was coming, even the treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> alſo, that he may be truſted in as an omniſcient Lord. 5. It is not enough to foreſee what troubles will come, or may come, unleſſe we ſpend our time profitably, in preparing and making ready for them; Therefore is Chriſts <hi>knowing that his hour was come,</hi> marked, as a reaſon why he was ſo buſie in the following purpoſe; Namely, that as his enemies were making ready, ſo he was making ready alſo; and having nothing to do for himſelfe, he ſpends his time in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the diſciples for the ſtorme. 6. Chriſt not only lets out proofes of his love to his own, when they need them; But he is thinking thoughts of peace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to let them out, when they little dream of ſuch a thing, till it appear: Therefore it is marked, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi> Chriſt was foreſeeing the ſtorme, and reſolving to let out proofes of love to his diſciples, which yet appeared not till <hi>after ſupper,</hi> ver. 2. 7. There is no difficultie ſo ſad, but Chriſt and his followers may get a comfortable look of it, were it even of death it ſelf; for, herein Chriſt hath caſt a copy, who looked on his ſad and bitter death, with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in his reſurrection and aſcenſion, as a <hi>departing out of this world, unto the Father.</hi> 8. It is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſight of death unto Saints, that hereby they are tranſlated from the miſeries, toiles, and vexations, of this world, to go reſt with, and enjoy God; for, herein hath Chriſt led the way, who <hi>departed out of this world, unto the Father,</hi> and did ſo look on his death. 9. It adds to the comfortable ſight of death, that Saints do hereby not only go to God, but do go to him as their Father through Chriſt; for, ſo did Chriſt; for, ſo did Chriſt <hi>depart unto the Father,</hi> and made way for our going to him as a Father in him, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.17, 10. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit Chriſt converſed but a ſhort while in the world, in reſpect of his bodily preſence; yet he did make and dayly makes a fair purchaſe in it by drawing ſinners to himſelfe; for, he hath <hi>his own</hi> in it. 12. As Chriſts people ought to reſigne themſelves to him, and be wholly for him; ſo he hath a peculiar intereſt in them, is ſpecially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their conditions, and, allowes ſpecial favours, priviledges, and care, upon them; for, they are <hi>his own,</hi> or his property and peculiar ones. 13. Love, even the infinite love of tender hearted Chriſt, is the allowance and portion of all his peculiar ones; for, <hi>he loved his own.</hi> 14. Albeit Chriſt leave his children in this tempeſtuous world, to be humbled with the reliques of ſin, and toſſed with the tempeſts of time; Yet that doth neither take away their intereſt in him, nor his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; for, <hi>he loved his own in the world.</hi> 15. The diſadvantages of Saints, and particularly, their being leſt in the world when Chriſt went out of it, is ſo far from hindering his love toward them, that it is rather an argument why he ſhould love them, and let out more of it; for, it is not only not an hinderance of his love, but an argument alſo, <hi>he loved his own,</hi> becauſe they <hi>were in the world.</hi> And eſpecially now, in his farewel, he would give a proofe of it, conſidering the dangers unto which they were left expoſed. 16. It is not enough to ſee Chriſts love towards his Saints in ſome particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, but they muſt labour to ſee an uninterrupted courſe thereof, from the time of their cloſing with him; Therefore, now at his farewel, he cleareth all by-go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as, that he had hitherto loved them, as well as he was now to give a proofe of it. <hi>Having loved his own, &amp;c.</hi> 17. Chriſts love is not to be meaſured by kinde out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettings to the ſatisfaction of ſenſe, but the ſumme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all his dealing toward his own, is love, which ought to be read in every condition and diſpenſation, were it even in keeping up his tender heart for a time; for, albeit there had been many ſeveral paſſages betwixt him and his diſciples, and ſome of them very croſſe to their humours; yet all is ſummed up in this, <hi>he had loved his own.</hi> 18. Chriſts ſpecial love toward his own is unchangable, and inceſſant, till they be perfected, and enjoy the full effects thereof; for, <hi>having loved his own, he loved them to the end,</hi> He continued his love from the beginning till now he is to dye for them and depart from them, and continueth it even then, and will do ſo, till they be brought to the end of their journey. 19. Chriſts love is not a decaying love, but a love that continually growes in effects; Nor is it a love that conſiſts only in good affection and wiſhes, but breaks forth in notable expreſſions, as he hath witneſſed by his dying for his own; for, <hi>he loved them to the end,</hi> even to the death he ſuffered for them, and in ſo doing, <hi>he loved them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> as the Word alſo will ſignifie, proving that his love was a growing love, in letting out ſuch abundant effects at the laſt. 20. When Chriſts followers are in any danger, then unchangeable love will be on foot, to cover their infirmities under tentation, and to provide cordials for them, and teſtifie his ſpecial care of them; for, this his love is marked as a cauſe why now, (when he is to remove they are to be ſcattered and ſhaken with tentation, and left deſolate,) he will let out ſo much of his heart in the following purpoſe, and give them ſuch ſweet inſtructions in the following ſigne and explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. And indeed, his love ſuffers much in his Diſciples need, and if there were no more, his love is enough to move him to ſee them well.</p>

only in general, is now preſſed to diſcover him more particularly, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. ſince it concerned him in his glory to foretell it before the hand: So, more eſpecially, it is a ground of his waſhing their feet, and of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſweet and uſeful doctrine. For knowing his time to be now ſhort, and that this night <hi>Judas</hi> would betray him; He doth buſily beſtir himſelfe, to pour out his heart in his diſciples boſome, and will let no minute of time ſlip, but in that one night did fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his heart unto them, and give an ample proofe of that love mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. In the other verſe is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned a third conſideration moving him to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Namely, That notwithſtanding <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, and his approaching ſufferings, yet he knew his own excellency and greatneſſe, that all power and authority is committed to him, and that as he came from God by his incarnation, ſo he was but returning to God by the chariot of his ſufferings. Which as it points out his admirable condeſcendence, that in the midſt of ſuch thoughts, he will ſtoop to ſo baſe an employment; So it contains a ſweet ground of his following practice, in that, however his hazard was neare, yet ſeeing through all theſe clouds, he is at leiſure to minde and promove his diſciples good, who would be in greater need through his ſuffering and removal from them.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing of <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Conſider, 1.

However, it ſufficeth us to know that the Paſſeover was eaten before he aroſe, and that which he ſate down to again, was a ſecond ſervice, or common ſupper ſubjoyned to it, during which he inſtituted the Sacrament of the Supper. Conſider, 2. It is a greater difficultie to clear how Chriſt ſhould e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the Paſſeover this night, and yet it ſhould ſeem the Jewes did not eat it till the night following, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. They who aſſert that Chriſt did anticipate the time, and eat it a day ſooner then was appointed, that ſo he, who was our true Paſſeover, might ſuffer on that day, whereon God appointed the Paſſeover to be killed and eaten; They, I ſay, ſeem not to remember that Chriſt was a fulfiller of all righteouſneſſe: Nor was there any ſuch prediction of Chriſts ſuffering on that day, as ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate him to tranſgreſſe a poſitive precept. Nor do they ſufficiently clear the difficulty, who aſſert, that the Jewes did eat the Paſſeover the ſame night with Chriſt, being the fourteenth day of the moneth; and that what is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. of the Jewes keeping themſelves undefiled, <hi>that they might eat the Paſſeover,</hi> is not to be underſtood of the Paſchal lamb, but of the peace-offerings on the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread, whereof the ſacrificers had a ſhare to feaſt on For it will not be cleared from Scripture, that to <hi>eat the paſſeover,</hi> is ſpoken of any other thing then of the very Paſchal lamb. Beſide <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. the day whereon Chriſt ſuffered, is called <hi>the preparation of the paſſeover,</hi> and ver. 31. the ſabbath day thereafter is called <hi>an high day,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth more, as we ſhall heare. 1. Therefore, for clearing the difficulty, it is to be conceived, that the Jewes by an ancient tradition (received, as is ſuppoſed in <hi>Babel</hi>) when ever any extraordinary ſolemnity fell on the day immediately preceding an ordinary Sabbath, they uſed to tranſlate the feſtivity to the Sabbath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, leſt there ſhould be two dayes concurring wherein they might not work. And ſo here the firſt day of the feaſt of the Paſſeover, or unleavened bread, (which, with the laſt of the ſeven dayes of the feaſt, was an holy convocation, <hi>Num.</hi> 28.16, 17, 18, 25.) falling according to the appointment of the Law, upon the day immediately preceding the Sabbath, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not only the following feaſt, but even the eating of the Paſſeover till the evening of the fifteenth day of the moneth, which ſhould have been the firſt day of the feaſt, (as ſeemeth to be clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. and 19.14.) and the leaſt it ſelfe, they conjoyned with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sabbath following for which cauſe it is called <hi>an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igh day,</hi> Joh. 19.31. becauſe of the conjunction of two feſtivities. For the mid-dayes of the feaſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, betwixt the firſt and the laſt, were not ſo ſolemnly obſerved, as to give ſuch a denomination to this Sabbath. Now Chriſt, not heeding their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did punctually obſerve the day inſtitute by God, not ſo much out of neceſſity, becauſe he had no longer time to live (for he might have prorogate his ſufferings) as to ſhew how cloſly we ought to cleave to a rule in the matter of inſtitute worſhip, and how dangerous it is to deviate, let the alteration have never ſo many fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for it. And whereas it may be objection, that this differing from the common practice would have been full of hazard to Chriſt, and matter of accuſation againſt him, which yet they never produce: It is to be conceived (for anſwer) not only that Chriſt did not ſtand on hazard who was now going to lay down his life, but further alſo, that this matter being private amongſt his diſciples and the Maſter of the houſe, (who it ſeems was a ſecret friend) could not ſo eaſily come to their knowledge: Or, rather, (ſeeing <hi>Judas,</hi> when he went to the high Prieſts, might eaſily have told it, if he had not been reſtrained) that the Jewes did ſo obſerve this Tradition, as yet in theſe troublous times, any who pleaſed to ſubmit to the inſtitute rule, did follow it. Conſider, 3. While it is ſaid, that the devil had <hi>now</hi> put it into the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray him, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that either Satan only now began to tempt him to it, or that the matter was now perfected; For it is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.6.—16. that upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the loſſe of the ointment, of which we heard, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12, 3, 4, &amp;c. he had made a bargain with the chief Prieſts about this matter, and from <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 30. of this chapter it is clear, that after this he was wholly given up to Satan, not only to project and capitulate about this buſineſſe, but to put it ſpeedily in execution. So the meaning is, that Chriſt took notice at this time, that <hi>Judas</hi> was lately prompted by Satan to go and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate about the betraying of him, as a reaſon why he would now be buſie with his diſciples; And ſo the words will read, that <hi>already</hi> (before this ſupper) <hi>the devil had put it in his heart.</hi> To which may be added further, that through his abuſe of the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, the devil got more footing, to confirme him in this wicked reſolution.</p>

                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48148:139"/>From <hi>v.</hi> 2. thus cleared, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such as do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly minde their duty, and conſider the ſhort time they may have for it, will diligently emprove every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of opportunity; for, <hi>ſupper being ended,</hi> (or in the time of the ſupper) Chriſt falls to work, and will not let that moment of time betwixt the paſchal ſupper, and the reſt of that meal, and his inſtituting of the Sacrament, paſſe away without ſome uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to his diſciples. 2. Such as conſcientiouſly employ their time, may in a ſhort minute thereof, (which being idly ſpent, would ſeem nothing) do much good in their ſtation; for, in a part of that night, after <hi>ſupper was ended,</hi> Chriſt not only taught his diſciples by waſhing of their feet, but did deliver the ſweet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and put up the ſolemn prayer that followes. 3. As at all times, ſo eſpecially before and after the participation of the Sacrament, men ought to ſtudy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their obligation thereunto, that they may employ Chriſt to work it in them; for, ſo much doth this circumſtance of time, wherein he waſhed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet, import. It was, <hi>ſupper being ended,</hi> after their eating the paſchal lamb, to teach them their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to purity, who were made partakers of ſuch a mercy: And before the Sacrament of the Supper, to teach them preparation. 4. Albeit Chriſt ſeem not alwayes to take notice of mens plots againſt him; yet he hath ſtill an eye upon them, and will give proof that he knowes them, when either he is to diſcover, or prevent, or emprove them: Therefore, albeit <hi>John</hi> record nothing of Chriſts taking notice of <hi>Judas</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, when he was diſappointed of the ointment, yet here it is remarked that, in due time, uſe is made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to move Chriſt to be diligent in dealing with the diſciples, and to decipher him. 5. As the right uſe of Sacraments, is a ſpecial mean of much good to the godly; ſo Satan never gets greater advantage of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, then after their prophane abuſe of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinances: Therefore alſo is it marked, that <hi>ſupper being ended, the devil hath now put it in his heart to betray him,</hi> or, confirmed him yet more in this wicked reſolution. 6 Albeit mens corruptions be prone to all evil, and Satan have ſome hand in every evil; yet there are ſome ſins that are ſingularly diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, and wherein Satan hath a chief hand, as being ſuch as could not be acted by a man in an ordinary courſe of ſinning, unleſſe he were poſſeſſed and acted by Satan in an extraordinary manner; for, this ſin is not ſimply attribute to <hi>Judas,</hi> but <hi>the devil put in the heart of Judas Iſcariot, Simons ſon, to betray him.</hi> It was not a ſin of humane infirmity, but a devilliſh ſin ſo to do. Such diabolical ſuggeſtions may be darted into the boſome of believers, and therefore they are warned to quench them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. But the wicked do give way to them. 7. The way whereby Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with wicked men, is, firſt to haunt and peſter their heart with his ſuggeſtions, till they be gained, and then he will eaſily carry them in their practice to act for him; for, thus did he begin here, he <hi>put it in the heart of Judas Iſcariot, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Albeit the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſuggeſtion unto evil be from Satan, yet mens corruptions furniſh him matter to work upon, and their dwelling upon wicked thoughts doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh occaſion to him to tempt, and bloweth up the ſpark of his tentation into a flame; for, thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, Satan got into his heart by reaſon of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; for, being diſappointed of the price of the ointment, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.5, 6. he is grieved and vexed at it; and while he is thinking how to make it up ſome other way, Satan darts in this, that he ſhould eſſay the trade of treachery, which preſently kindled, as when fire is put to powder. 9. Whatever be Satans deſigne againſt the man whom he tempts, or againſt the Saints, when he ſtirreth up perſecutors; yet his great deſign is againſt Chriſt himſelf; for, here he <hi>put in the heart of Judas to betray him,</hi> not ſo much regarding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſo long as he was in the world, to be the Butt of his malice. 10. Satan doth oppoſe himſelf againſt Chriſt and his followers, not only by more immediate tentations, (whereof Chriſt alſo had proof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4) or by ſtirring up open perſecutors; But one of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial engines, is, to employ treacherous friends, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him and them; for, this was Satans great work, to get a domeſtick, <hi>Judas, to betray him.</hi> 11. Satan getting way, may not only prevail with moſt eminent viſible Profeſſours, or ordinary Teachers, but even with ſome among the very Apoſtles, to do a piece of the worſt ſervice that ever was done to Chriſt; for, here he <hi>puts in the heart of</hi> an Apoſtle, <hi>Judas Iſcariot, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſon,</hi> (ſo deſcribed, to diſtinguiſh him from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Apoſtle of the ſame name, as <hi>chap</hi> 6.71.) <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him.</hi> 12. No apprehenſion or thoughts of trouble did alter Chriſts heart toward his people; but the more violent and near the ſtorme was to him, the more diligent was he to lay out himſelf for their good; Therefore is this treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> marked here, to ſhew that Chriſts thoughts thereof, did but ſtir him up to be more ſedulous in inſtructing them. And if the thoughts of diſtracting trouble could not take him off from his care of them, we have the leſſe cauſe to fear his forgetfulneſſe of us, now when he is above all ſtormes, in his own bleſſed perſon.</p>

Whatever were the attempts of Satan and his inſtruments againſt Chriſt, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his condeſcendence was, to give way unto them; yet he was truly excellent and great in the midſt of all his condeſcendence and ſufferings; for, even when <hi>Judas</hi> is conſulting to betray him, it held true that <hi>the Father had given all things into his hands, &amp;c.</hi> 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it pleaſed Chriſt to condeſcend unto, in his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary exmanition; yet he needed to be little diſcouraged at the attempts of enemies, or his ſufferings, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own excellency, even in his greateſt abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, when <hi>Judas</hi> is ſeeking to betray him, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus knew,</hi> even then, <hi>that the Father had given all things into his hands, &amp;c.</hi> 3 It is the duty of Saints in the time of their abaſement and trials, not to dwell alwayes on the thoughts of theſe; but to raiſe up their hearts in the conſideration of their eſteem with God through Chriſt, however the world account of them, and of the iſſue of their trials however the world think to cut them off thereby, as the off-ſcouring of the earth; for, herein Chriſt hath caſt them a copy, who while <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> is projecting his ruine, hath his heart fraught with thoughts of his own dominion and glory, and that as <hi>he came from God,</hi> ſo <hi>he went to God,</hi> by his ſufferings, 4.

That Saints may ſleep ſoundly, having ſuch a friend at the helme of Providence. 2. That however wicked enemies ſeem to rage at their pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his followers; yet they are given alſo into his hands; And, that as he in the midſt of traitours and enemies, was yet in the hands (if not of friends, yet) of ſervants and ſlaves; ſo the moſt pernicious of them are given, through him, to the Church, for her good. 3. That men are but great fools, when, notwithſtanding all their covetouſneſſe, they muſt be content with a few things, and yet all things might be theirs, in a right ſenſe and due order, through him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. for all things are his, and theirs in him. 4. That they are no leſſe fools, who make themſelves ſlaves to any thing, whereas in Chriſt they might be Maſters of all things. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Whatever were mens thoughts of Chriſt, yet he came from God in reſpect of the divine way of his conception, and his Godheads ſtooping to converſe with us in the ſhape of a ſervant; And, he was his Ambaſſadour, ſent to deal with loſt man in his Name; for, <hi>he was come from God,</hi> yet ſo as he did not leave him. 6. However Chriſt and his ſufferings were looked on by carnal man; yet thereby he returned to God, to be glorified with him as Mediatour, yet ſo as he hath not left his people; for, <hi>he went to God.</hi> 7. Chriſts thoughts of his excellency will not hinder his condeſcendence to his own; but in his thoughts of greateſt glory, he will evidence greateſt humility; and his knowing of his own excellency makes him fit to minde his people in the midſt of his greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for, this purpoſe is premitted to his waſhing their feet, to ſhew, how conſiſtent his thoughts of this are with his lowly ſtooping, (knowing all this, <hi>he riſeth from ſupper, &amp;c.</hi>) And it is ſubjoyned to <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, to ſhew how little that would hinder him, who was ſo high, from thinking upon his poor follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Hereby alſo we are aſſured, that as his thoughts of his glory did not, ſo his poſſeſſion of it doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from condeſcending to the neceſſities of his own.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, the fact it ſelf, of Chriſts waſhing his diſciples feet, is recorded. Wherein appeareth his admirable humilitie and ſelf-denial, in that he layeth his ſtate and his own refreſhment, and riſeth from ſupper while his ſervants ſate ſtill: he layeth aſide his upper garments, (which were looſe) as ſervants uſed to do when they went to work, or, to ſerve their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; he girded himſelf with a towel, both to faſten his other garments upon him, that he might be more fit for the work, and to have it in readineſſe to wipe their feet with it. And having provided and brought the baſin with water, he began to waſh and wipe their feet (which lay out behinde them, as they leaned at table, and) which was a moſt ſervile employment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.41. I ſhall not need here to enquire, whether the Jewes had ſuch a cuſtome as this, to waſh their feet after their eating of the paſchal Lamb, which Chriſt here imitates in ſo ſingular a way, and emproves to ſo notable ſpiritual advantage. Nor ſhall I need here to inſiſt on this practice, which is ſo fully explained afterward. Only, for preſent, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Chriſt is infinitely glorious and exalted in himſelfe, ſo is he admirably humble and condeſcending to his people; for, our High Lord <hi>riſeth from ſupper, &amp;c. and began to waſh his diſciples feet.</hi> 2. Chriſts humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will ſtoop to do meaneſt things for his people, were it even to become a ſervant to them; for, he acts all the parts of a mean ſervant here. And he did this, being on earth, to give proof what mean neceſſities of ours he will ſtoop to take notice of, though he be abſent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 3. True humility is the compendious way to true honour, and to be leaſt in Chriſts houſe is the way to become greateſt; for, ſo doth he teach us, in that when he is about to go to God, <hi>v.</hi> 3. he moſt eminently kithes his humility. 4. It is a ſpecial proof of Chriſts love, and of his care of his people in the midſt of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and glory, when he teacheth humility and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it in them, by his Word, Example, or Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; for, herein all the former conſiderations, of his love to them, and his care of them, when he thinks of his ſufferings and glory, did appear, in that he took this pains not only to ſtoop to them, but to caſt them a copy, and give them a leſſon of humilitie.</p>

This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be drawn out in three branches, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his threefold anſwer to <hi>Peters</hi> propoſals and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. In the firſt branch of the Expoſition upon occaſion of <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion, teſtifying his admiration, and ſhunning of ſuch condeſcendence, he gives notice in general, that there was ſomewhat more in it then the bare act, or then he ſaw for preſent, whereof he ſhould be informed in due time. And this relates to his doing this act, both as it was a ſigne, and as it was a ſervile employment in it ſelfe. We need not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly determine, whether he had waſhen any before he came to <hi>Peter,</hi> who had made no ſuch ſcruple of it; But ſhall hold to what <hi>John</hi> here records, that coming to <hi>Peter,</hi> he meets with this ſtop flowing from <hi>Peters</hi> forwardneſſe, and gives an anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Our Lords humility yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſhineth, in that not only doth he ſtoop to do meaneſt ſervices to his people, but will be at all the pains himſelf to do them good; for, <hi>he cometh to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter,</hi> to waſh him, while he is ſitting ſtill at Table. 2. There is no interruption or impediment laid in the way of Chriſt and his working, but he can, and doth emprove it to precious ends and advantages; for, out of <hi>Peters</hi> refuſal and interruption he beings out theſe precious inſtructions, which he would incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by his waſhing of their feet. 3. Chriſts abaſing of himſelf, and condeſcending to his people, ought not to obſcure his Majeſty, nor make them forget it; for, in the midſt of this his ſtooping, he is to <hi>Peter, Lord.</hi> 4. Chriſts abaſement and condeſcendence for his peoples good, is truly admirable, and will be ſo in the eyes of the truly godly; for, ſaith he, by way of admiration; <hi>Lord, doſt thou waſh my feet!</hi> 5. The admirableneſſe of Chriſts condeſcendence will appear, if we conſider, either how glorious he is who ſtoops, even the <hi>Lord,</hi> or how low he doth ſtoop, even to <hi>waſh feet;</hi> or, to whom he ſtoops, even to them who are unworthy of what he doth, and whom it beſeems not to be ſo dealt with, though it beſeem him well ſo to deal; doeſt thou waſh <hi>my feet?</hi> ſaith humble <hi>Peter.</hi> 6. As it is commendable to fear, even at Chriſts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted goodneſſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. So Saints ordinarily run to an extremity in that caſe, and do ſo fear and tremble at it, as they are ready to decline and not to embrace it; for, <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion imports not only his admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at, but his deſire to ſhun this condeſcendence, and doth put a ſtop to Chriſts waſhing and conferring this favour on him. See <hi>Luke</hi> 5.8. 7. Albeit Chriſts ſtooping to us be a great abaſement of himſelf; yet it is the great errour of Saints, to think that he will not account it his great glory to ſerve them; for, herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Peter</hi> failed, in thinking Chriſt had forgot himſelf in this condeſcendence.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is very tender of the weakneſſes of his own, ſo long as they diſcover no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy therein; for, he gives a milde anſwer to <hi>Peter</hi> at firſt, till afterward his weakneſſe burſt forth. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very work of Chriſt toward his people, beſide the work it ſelf, carrieth ſome precious thing of him in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of it, and is loaden with leſſons and great things of his wiſdom, power, goodneſſe, &amp;c. for, ſo is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here, that Chriſt is <hi>doing</hi> ſomewhat which <hi>Peter</hi> knows not. Which is not to be underſtood of the ſimple waſhing their feet, (for <hi>Peter</hi> knew well enough that he was about to waſh his feet) but that this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried ſomewhat in the boſome of it. 3. That which the Lord is doing by his works, is not often ſeen in the mean time, by them to whom it is done; for, <hi>What I do thou knoweſt not now.</hi> Yea, wherein do not we proclaim our ignorance and miſtakes of what he is about? And no wonder we be in the dark here, if we conſider, 1. That the worker of theſe works is <hi>wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working,</hi> Iſa. 28.29. Infinitely beyond Politicians, whoſe projects and purpoſes are oft-times hid from us, and therefore much more his. 2. That the way of his working and bringing about of his purpoſes, is very ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable; for, he brings things out of nothing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. one contrary out of another, as light out of darkneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. he brings meat out of the eater, and takes enemies in their own ſnares. 3. That his end in working is not to ſatisfie our ſenſe and curioſity, but he chooſeth ſuch a way, as may leave enemies to harden their hearts, and may try and humble his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Albeit we cannot dive into the depth of Chriſts counſel in his working, yet we ought to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and adore him therein, and not to conteſt with him; and to yield implicit obedience to his Will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing our duty in ſuch a caſe; for, albeit <hi>Peter know not now, what he doth,</hi> yet he would have him ſo far crediting that he did it not in vain, as to ſubmit to have his feet waſhed. 5. Chriſt will have us firſt yielding obedience to his Will, becauſe it is his Will, and to wait his leiſure till we know the reaſon of it: Otherwiſe, we do not obey becauſe it is his Will, but becauſe of the reaſon of his Command; for, he will abſolutely have him ſtoop to be waſhed by him, and then wait till <hi>hereafter,</hi> to know what it means, and for what end he doth it. 6. Such as in dark caſes do abſolutely ſubmit to Gods Will, in the matter of duty or diſpenſations; they ſhall, in due time, ſee a reaſon of his Will, and know ſo much of his counſel and purpoſe in his working, as is needful for them; for, upon <hi>Peters</hi> obedience is promiſed, that though <hi>what I do, thou knoweſt not now,</hi> yet <hi>thou ſhalt know here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> As accordingly was made good in the following explication of all this, and when the Spirit was poured out, he, with the reſt, underſtood more fully this and other things.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecend branch of this Expoſition, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Peters</hi> more peremptory refuſal, there is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expoſition of the meaning of this waſhing, and of the neceſſity of what he intended to point at thereby. For <hi>Peter</hi> not acquieſcing in what Chriſt had told him, but proceeding from admiration to a wilful refuſal, that Chriſt ſhould waſh his feet, as conceiving it his duty in modeſty to refuſe; however Chriſt ſhould preſſe it: Chriſt taking hardly with this, renounces all communion with him, and diſclaims that <hi>Peter</hi> had any intereſt in him, unleſſe he did waſh him. Which doth not import only that his wilful refuſing to ſtoop to Chriſts Will in this external waſhing, would, if he perſiſted in it, prove him to be in a bad condition, though that be true in it ſelfe: But chiefly, (as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing expoſition of waſhing their feet in particular makes clear) it points out that Chriſt, by waſhing their feet, would (not inſtitute a Sacrament, but) put them in minde of ſoule waſhing, which as it can only be done by him, ſo without it, men can prove no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in him. And ſo the meaning of this waſhing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is, to point out the neceſſity of waſhing ſinners by Regeneration, Juſtification, and begun Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was alſo the ſignification of their ſeveral waſhing under the Law, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48148:141"/>
ſeeming humility in the matters of God, which yet is but prepoſterous and ſinful, and learnt from carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, ſuch was <hi>Peters</hi> humility, condemned by Chriſt here. See <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 23. 2. It doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mens tentations and ſinful humility, that it ſeems to riſe from much good, but we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt what is really good, and what tentations Satan faſtens on it; for, this condemned humility did begin at admiration, at Chriſts condeſcendence, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and grounded it ſelf upon his reſpect to Chriſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of himſelf. 3. It is an evidence men are under a tentation, when they are ſtiffe, and do pertinaciouſly ſtand out againſt Chriſts verdict; And in particular, it is but ſinful humility, when men will not ſubmit to Chriſts verdict and Will; for, this was the fault in <hi>Peters</hi> humility, that he would not take ſatisfaction from Chriſt, concerning what he was doing. 4. It is but ſinful and prepoſterous humility, which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſts offer, whatever it be, or how unworthy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we be of it; for, this alſo was <hi>Peters</hi> fault, <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet;</hi> He thought himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this condeſcendence, and therefore utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to admit of his offer; ſo the contrary of this in the Churches admitting of Chriſts commendation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was pleaſed to have a deſire toward her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1, 2, &amp;c. with <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>From Chriſts anſwer to <hi>Peter, Learn,</hi> 1. Saints, by what they do out of a pretext of humility, may be running on a ſnare, and deſerving ſad threatnings from him; for, <hi>Peters</hi> humility meets with this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. 2. It is Chriſts method, oft-times with his people, to break their obſtinacy with ſad threatnings, and to boaſt them to their mercy, and from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous humility, when faire dealing will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them; for, thus doth he deal with <hi>Peter.</hi> 3. It is the ſaddeſt of threatnings and judgments, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from an intereſt in, and communion with Chriſt; Therefore is it held out to <hi>Peter</hi> as a very ſad caſe, <hi>Thou haſt no part in me,</hi> that is, no intereſt in him, and conſequently, no communion with him, nor ſhare in that inheritance purchaſed by him, and ſo is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir with him. 4. The contempt of an Ordinance or Command of Chriſt, how mean-like ſoever, deſerves the ſaddeſt of threatnings, and that the contemner ſhould be ſecluded from Chriſt; for, this holds true, even of the outward waſhing, and his reſiſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when Chriſt required it, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> By which ſad threatning Chriſt drives <hi>Peter</hi> to ſubmit. 5. Soul-purging from ſin is ſo neceſſary, that without it men can have no evidence of intereſt in, or communion with Chriſt; for, it holds chiefly true of the thing pointed at, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> 6. It is neither the goodneſſe of our nature, nor legal purifications, or our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that can either prove, or make us clean; But it is Chriſt alone who muſt waſh us, that we may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with him, and who muſt apply the merit and efficacy of his blood for that end; for, <hi>If I waſh thee not,</hi> faith he, <hi>thou haſt no part with me.</hi>

                  <p>In the third branch of this expoſition, upon occaſion of <hi>Peters</hi> running to another extremity, Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares what he meant by waſhing their feet only. In this verſe we have <hi>Peters</hi> propoſal, occaſioning the explication: He, being afrighted with the former threatning, and (belike) now underſtanding what Chriſt meant by this external waſhing, he is ſo farre from refuſing that Chriſt ſhould waſh his feet, that he offers hands and head, and all to be waſhed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is ſo terrible a thing to be threatned with ſeparation from Chriſt, that the thoughts thereof will cauſe a childe of God draw nearer to him, and make him condeſcend to any thing, rather then admit of that; for, this brake <hi>Peters</hi> obſtinacy, and made him ſay, <hi>Lord, not my feet only, but alſo my hands and mine head,</hi> before that be. 2. Saints, being ſenſible of ſin, are ready to forget their renewed and juſtified eſtate, and to look on themſelves as altogether polluted and corrupt; for, this may alſo be underſtood as <hi>Peters</hi> language, when he underſtood the ſignification of this waſhing. In which caſe, he ſeeth not only foul feet, but head and hands, and all to be waſhed, and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, he offers them all to Chriſt. Which, though Chriſt clear it to be his miſtake, yet it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſad exerciſe of Saints. 3. It is the great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Saints, that they run, for moſt part, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; And when they leave one extremity, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not to the right way, but fall on the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; for, whether we look to the external action, or ſignification thereof, <hi>Peter</hi> did thus erre, firſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to be waſhed at all, and then in offering more to be waſhed then Chriſt required.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In this verſe we have Chriſts anſwer to this offer of <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein he clears what he meant by waſhing their feet only: Namely, not only to teſtifie his humility by ſtooping ſo low, but further, to point out ſomewhat concerning them. And 1. He propounds his minde in general doctrine, wherein the ſimilitude runs thus; That as a man going home from a bath needs not waſh his whole body again, but only his feet, which contract filth by walking, as they uſed in theſe hot countreyes to travel barefooted: So Saints who are already waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by begun renovation and the Juſtification of their perſons, need not ever again waſh, as if every ſpot did alter their ſtate, but ought only to be purging their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions from the reliques of ſin, by getting daily renewed remiſſion, and ſtudying ſanctification daily. In ſaying, <hi>he who is waſhed, is clean every whit.</hi> He doth not aſſert an abſolute purity in any within time, nor yet is it only his meaning, that he is clean by begun renovation, which is perfect in parts, though not in degrees: But the ſenſe chiefly is, that by Juſtification his perſon is clean, and that the man who, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and juſtified, doth make daily uſe of his priviledge of having acceſſe to the fountain opened up, for daily renewed remiſſion, and waſhing of his foul feet, he is clean every whit in Gods account, nor is there any
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48148:141"/>
ſpot in him, for which God will condemn him. 2. Chriſt makes particular application of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the diſciples, pronouncing that ſociety clean, though with exception of ſome, (for which a reaſon is after given) and that therefore they needed to waſh no more but their feet. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the Will of Chriſt that Saints in their exerciſes, do put a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the ſtate of their perſons, and the ſeveral conditions into which they may fall; for, here is a <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>clean</hi> man, who yet hath <hi>feet</hi> to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. No man can be in an acceptable ſtate, but he to whom it is gifted by Chriſt, and communicate through his blood and ſpirit; for, <hi>he is waſhed,</hi> who <hi>is clean</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. 3. Saints, whoſe perſons are clean, have yet, while they are within time, ſome pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and reliques of ſin left, for their exerciſe and humiliation; and in their affections and actions are daily contracting filth; for, <hi>he that is waſhed, needeth to waſh his feet.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. and 143.2. 4. The infirmities of waſhed Saints are not univerſal, nor like the voluntary wallowing of ſwine in the puddle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. but are only defilements of their feet, or of their affections and converſation in going through this polluted world; for, ſo much is imported, that they <hi>need but to waſht their feet.</hi> Where the ſimilitude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that this pollution reaches not their beſt parts, at leaſt reignes not there; that it breaks forth rather in their practice, then utterly poiſons their heart; and, that however it have a fountain within, yet it is much helped on, by reaſon of pollution and entanglements without them, as mens feet are fouled by the ground they tread upon. 5. It is the duty, and ought to be the care of Saints, not to pleaſe themſelves in this, that their defilements are but infirmities, but they muſt be waſhed from them; for, <hi>he that is waſhed, needeth</hi> yet <hi>to waſh his feet.</hi> So did <hi>Paul</hi> purſue the leaſt relique of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. Not only the Juſtification of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but even the waſhing of our infirmities, muſt be Chriſts work; for, the external action Chriſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, teacheth, that he alſo muſt <hi>waſh the feet.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a juſtified ſinner can never be ſeparated from Chriſt; yet as a man who never employes Chriſt for pardon and purging of his daily infirmities, doth evidence that he is not juſtified; ſo a juſtified man will purſue theſe reliques of ſin, that ſo he may thereby be more and more confirmed in the aſſurance of his intereſt in Chriſt; for, unto this <hi>waſhing of the feet,</hi> Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth that, <hi>v</hi> 8. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> 8. It is not Chriſts Will that Saints, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every new out-breaking, ſhould caſt looſe their ſtate, as if their Regeneration, and Juſtification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation were made void thereby; but they are to hold that faſt as a thing not to be renewed, (though when the diſcharge is dim, they may ſeek a new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract) and ſo go on to get that waſhed which is foule; for, <hi>be that is waſhed, needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> 9. Albeit Saints be weak in faith, and imperfect in Sanctification, yet there is a Goſpel-reckoning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they are every whit clean; Namely, when they are juſtified and their ſins pardoned, and when they are daily ſtudying Sanctification, and making uſe of daily remiſſion and cleanſing; for, ſuch a one <hi>is waſhed,</hi> and <hi>clean every whit.</hi> 10. General doctrine is then only uſeful, when particular application is made thereof; Therefore Chriſt applies this to them, <hi>And ye are clean.</hi> 11. It is not they who juſtifie themſelves, that are clean, but theſe whom Chriſt accounts to be ſo; and his abſolving word is ſufficient to ſecure a Saint, who is humbled with his own ſpots, that he is clean in his account; for, here he gives this for their ſecurity, <hi>Ye are clean.</hi> 12. Hypocriſie and uncleanneſs are ſo univerſal, that its rate to ſee the cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lets out his approbation unto any, but ordinarily he ſubjoynes ſo much with it, as may make them very circumſpect and jealous of themſelves; The clore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſentence, <hi>Ye are clean,</hi> be ſubjoynes ſo general an exception, <hi>but not all,</hi> neither declaring whom or how many he excepted, that ſo every one might try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> ſubjoynes a reaſon why Chriſt made this exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and points out who it was that he meant by this exception, even <hi>Judas</hi> the traitour. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt knows a reaſon for every thing he ſaith or doth, whether we know it or not; as here we ſee. 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit neither can men diſcern, nor ought they to judge hardly of others, who have not diſcovered themſelves; yet Chriſt can diſtinguiſh betwixt true profeſſours and latent hypocrites, and may let forth what he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he pleaſeth; for, <hi>he knew who ſhould betray him,</hi> and <hi>therefore ſaid</hi> this. 3.

after Chriſt had done with it, wherein he explains it, as it was a ſervile employment performed by him to them, that hereby he might teach them humility. In this expoſition we may obſerve ſix particulars, whereof the firſt (in this verſe) contains ſomewhat antecedent to the expoſition; Namely, that before he performe his promiſe to <hi>Peter,</hi> ver. 7. he goeth on to waſh all their feet, and having taken his garments, and ſitten down, he enquireth at themſelves if they underſtood what he meant by all this. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever be the ſtrugglings of Saints againſt Chriſts dealing, yet he will have his will, and carry through his purpoſe; for, notwithſtanding <hi>Peters</hi> oppoſition (wherein others, as humble as he, might have been ready to imitate him,) yet <hi>he waſhed their feet.</hi> 2. Chriſts favours are not tendered complements, but really conferred mercies, and he will come over much oppoſition, to make them effectual; for, he not only offered, but really did <hi>waſh their feet.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſts ſervants and people have a promiſe, that he will make known his minde in things that concerne them, which he will performe in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Yet he will exerciſe their ſubmiſſion and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at leiſure, before he performe it; for, he <hi>waſheth</hi> all <hi>their feet, takes his garments, and ſate down again,</hi> and propounds this queſtion, before he make good that promiſe given to <hi>Peter,</hi> ver 7. 4. Where Chriſt is about to teach his people, he will firſt humble them under the ſenſe of their own ignorance, and then will teach them; for, this queſtion, <hi>know ye what I have done unto you?</hi> tends to diſcover their ignorance of the matter, to humble them. 5. It is the duty of Chriſts ſcholars, to be ſerious in attending what he is doing about them, and to them; and to rowze up themſelves to attend what he will teach thereby: for, this queſtion is alſo put, to ſtir them up to attend to the former action and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing explication.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond place, Chriſt layeth down a ground whereon to preſſe the following doctrine and explication of this action; which is taken from the titles due to him, and given to him by the diſciples. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt requires acknowledgements and due titles from his people, and they who know him, will not deny them; for, ſo was their uſe, <hi>Ye call me Maſter,</hi> (or, <hi>Teacher,) and Lord.</hi> 2. Many titles, and all ſoveraignty over us, is due unto Chriſt; He will not be content to be a <hi>Maſter</hi> to teach, as the Phariſees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time pretended to acknowledge, unleſs he be taken alſo for a <hi>Lord,</hi> who muſt be obeyed, and to govern and rule us; Nor will he be pleaſed with glorious titles, of <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> when men will not ſtoop to hearken to his doctrine. Therefore, are they conjoyned, <hi>Maſter, and Lord.</hi> 3. We can give no glorious titles to Chriſt, but they are due to him, and as he will accept of them, ſo he will be anſwerable to them; He is a faithful Teacher, and a Ruler who will protect and defend them who come under his protection; for, ſaith he, <hi>ye ſay well, for ſo I am.</hi> 4. Chriſt will not be content of titles or fair profeſſions, unleſſe men do emprove them in practice, and do not give their own tongues the lye; Therefore Chriſt takes hold of their acknowledgement, to urge the following doctrine upon them, as being obliged thereunto by their own profeſſions.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the third place, we have Chriſts doctrine inferred upon this ground, and the expoſition of his carriage in waſhing their feet; Namely, that by his doing thereof, who was their Lord and Maſter, to them his ſervants, he would teach them their duty, to condeſcend ſo low, as to waſh one anothers feet. Whereby we are not to underſtand only this particular ſervice to be mutually done, (as ſome do formally and ſuperſtitiouſly imitate him herein) but under this one abject peace of ſervice, all duties of love and condeſcendence, how baſe ſoever, are required. Neither yet are outward actions of love to be underſtood, as only comprehended under this; but includes alſo all the internal ingredients thereof in the heart, ſuch as humility toward God, a low eſteem of our ſelves, an high eſteem of others, &amp;c. And by this direction inforced from his own example, he would obviate the great emulation among his Apoſtles, which (if not cured) might do ſo much hurt after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. From this purpoſe, (leaving the force of his example till the following verſes.) <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Humility, love, and condeſcendence, are moſt neceſſary among the members of Chriſt; Therefore doth he ſo ſeriouſly preſſe theſe here. See 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5.5. 2. True humility doth not conſiſt in external ſhewes, but will ſtoop to the meaneſt ſervice, wherein one may be ſteadable to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; were it even to <hi>waſh one anothers feet.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. 3. Albeit it bring rich advantage to the man himſelfe who is humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending, though none other ſhould joyne with him in it; Yet it is neceſſary for the general good of the Church, that mutual ſubjection to performe baſeſt duties, be the bond to binde Saints one to another; for, they ſhould <hi>waſh one anothers feet.</hi> The Church doth then live in true peace, when every one of her members becometh a ſervant to another. 4. Albeit men be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to look on this humility and mutual condeſcendence as a free-will offering, for omitting whereof they are not convinced, and in performing of it they are much puffed up; Yet it is a commanded duty, not to be omitted without ſin, and in the performance whereof we are ſtill unprofitable ſervants; for, <hi>ye ought to waſh one anothers feet.</hi> 5. Humility and mutual condeſcendence are eſpecially neceſſary in Miniſters, that their pride and emulation do not mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of no ſuperiority in any of his Miniſters over the reſt, and requireth alſo that they lay aſide any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preeminence or prerogative, and by love ſerve one another; for, they are all to <hi>waſh one anothers feet.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the fourth place, This duty is more diſtinctly inforced from Chriſts former practice in waſhing their feet; wherein he ſheweth, that he did it as an example to them, which therefore they are bound to imitate. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a commendable duty in the Lords children, to ſtudy to be good examples in their carriage, one to another; for, herein Chriſt hath led the way, in <hi>giving</hi> good <hi>example.</hi> 2. Albeit Chriſt, as God, and Mediatour, hath done works of omnipotency and by way of ſatisfaction for ſinners, which are or can be imitate by none; Yet in the matter of obedience to the Law, he hath done works expreſſely for imitation and example, which are to be marked; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have given you an example.</hi> 3. As in all duties of obedience, ſo eſpecially in the matter of humility, Chriſt hath caſt an excellent copy to his followers; both to encourage poor ſinners to come to him, and excite them to follow him; for, this is the particular, wherein, ſaith he, <hi>I have given you an example.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. 4. Such as acknowledge Chriſt to be precious, as they will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to all his commands, ſo they will count it a ſtrong obligation to any duty, that Chriſt hath gone about it in his own practice, and thereby commended it to them; for, they ought <hi>waſh one anothers feet,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>for I have given you an example,</hi> &amp;c. 5. It ſtands as a general rule, that what Chriſt hath done to us in love, we ſtand bound, in our ſtations, and to our power, to do the ſame to others; for, <hi>ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi> Our imitation comes alwayes ſhort; but we muſt follow him in ſo far as we can attain. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.14, 15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the fifth place, This practice and example of Chriſt is further urged to preſſe this duty, from the conſideration of his excellency, which he had laid down as a ground, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and ſummarily urged, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. As Chriſts greatneſſe above his ſervants is urged elſe-where to make them content with the lots he was exerciſed with, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.24, 25. So here it is made uſe of, to preſſe them to that humility one toward another which he had ſhewed toward them. And this makes the argument from his example conclude more ſtrongly, that they, who were ſo far inferiour to him, ſhould not diſdain to practice that condeſcendence he had uſed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever dignity Chriſt conferre upon his Servants and Officers; Yet he is the authorizer of them all, and Lord above them all, and over all his Church: And it is the greateſt dignity of any, to be his ſervants and repreſent him in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: for, ſo is here imported. 2. Chriſts great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency contributes to ſet forth and commend his humility to us; Therefore, in this action he is ſo oft ſpoken of as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>ſender</hi> of his ſervants. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. 3. It becomes Chriſts followers to affect no greater eminency in this world, then Chriſt had and not to diſdain to ſtoop ſo low as he did; for, if <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> be not made leſſe then his <hi>Lord,</hi> it is no reaſon he ſhould look to be <hi>greater.</hi> 4. The conſideration of our baſeneſs ſhould keep our mindes lowly, and free of affecting ſuperiority over our brethren; for, Chriſt preſſeth the duty on this ground, that they are but <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and <hi>ſent.</hi> 5. Whoſoever doth refuſe to walk humbly toward his fellow diſciples, he doth in effect deny his inferiority to Chriſt: for, either he muſt deny that <hi>the ſervant is not greater then his Lord, or he that is ſent, then he that ſent him,</hi> or elſe he muſt ſtoop to waſh the feet of others. 6. Albeit our baſeneſſe be very viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelfe, eſpecially when we are compared with Chriſt; yet it is not uſually pondered by us as it ought, nor ſo ſtudyed as the fruits thereof may appear in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for, it muſt be born upon them with Chriſts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> to drive them to this condeſcendence. 7. Whatever be the ſhiftings of our ambitious hearts; Yet Chriſt will not on any tearmes diſpenſe with the want of humility and condeſcendence in his followers; But he will either have them ſtoop, or elſe he will abaſe them; Therefore alſo doth he urge this with a <hi>verily verily,</hi> to preſſe it as a grave and neceſſary matter: and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt of the words he ſo ſpeaks, as may import both their duty to imitate their Lord and Maſter, and his will (eſpecially if they did not ſo) that they ſhould meet with ſuch humbling lots as he did.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt place, Chriſt not being content with a bare ſpeculation in this matter, and having ſufficiently informed them of their duty in it; He comes very earneſtly to preſſe the practice thereof, and to encourage them thereunto, by an annexed promiſe of bleſſedneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt doth not approve of blinde ignorance in his people, whatever their practice or converſation be; But requires that their practice be founded on ſound and ſolid knowledge of his will; for, he requires that they <hi>know theſe things,</hi> and then <hi>do them.</hi> 2. When much pains is taken to inculcate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet men may remain very ignorant, partly, through their natural impotency, and chiefly, through their inadvertenſie, &amp; being tranſported with luſts and carnal imaginations; for, <hi>If ye know theſe things,</hi> is not only a ſuppoſition that knowledge muſt go before practice; but may import a doubt alſo, if yet they were made capable of this doctrine. For they were ſo tranſported with a carnal dream of the Meſſiah's Kingdome, that they could not underſtand his clear predictions of his ſufferings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.31, 32, 33, 34. And what wonder if their carnal emulation did hide this doctrine from them alſo? 3. The doctrine of humility and mutual condeſcendence is very comprehenſive, and contains many duties in the boſome of it, which are called for in variety of caſes and exigents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore doth he ſpeak of what is underſtood by <hi>waſhing one anothers feet,</hi> ver. 14. in the plural number, <hi>know theſe things,</hi> and <hi>do
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48148:143"/>
them.</hi> 4. The Lord approves not, in the matters of Religion, that men content themſelves with knowledge and ſpeculations; But it is his will, that men, having known their duty, do put it in practice, and do prove the ſincerity and ſoundneſſe of their knowledge, by their practice; for, ſo doth this connexion import, <hi>If ye know theſe things, do them,</hi> and ſo prove that ye know indeed. See <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24, 25. 5. In particular, the Lord requireth the practice of humility, and it is the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of mens ſincerity, not what knowledge they have of it, the contemplation and notion whereof may be ſweet: But what they do in practice on particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igents, which will be more bitter and trying then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation was; for, this, in particular, is the duty wherein he requires that practice follow knowledge. 6. Albeit our obedience and practice deſerve nothing; Yet it hath ſuch a bleſſing in the boſome of it, and is the way to ſuch rich bleſſedneſſe, as doth compenſe all loſſe and diſadvantage; for, this is the encouragement, <hi>happy are ye, if ye do them.</hi> 7. Albeit the condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and humble man ſeem to loſe much thereby in the world; yet bleſſedneſs is allowed to make it up: And to attain the practice of humility, is a bleſſedneſs in it ſelfe, in ſo far as it hides a man from many ſtormes and diſcontentments, wherewith others are blown over; for, of this in particular, it is ſaid, <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> 8. Ambitious proud men are ſo far from bleſſedneſs, that they lye under a curſe; eſpecially if they know their duty and will not do it; for, it followeth on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>If ye know theſe things, curſed are ye if ye do them not.</hi> See <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.21.</p>

John <hi>being ſet on work by</hi> Peter, <hi>to enquire concerning this traitour, Chriſt by a ſigne doth diſcover</hi> Judas <hi>to him,</hi> ver. 23, 24, 25, 26. 4. <hi>This diſcovery producing woful effects in</hi> Judas, <hi>Chriſt diſcovers more of his minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his treachery, to himſelfe, when he is going out to effectuate it,</hi> ver. 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

He gives the ground of this exception, and why he did thus pronounce of any of them; Namely, that he <hi>knew whom he had choſen,</hi> The meaning whereof is not ſo much that he knew what every one whom he had choſen to the Apoſtleſhip would prove, and <hi>Judas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt; (though that be alſo true) But he knew who they were whom, beſide election to the Apoſtleſhip, (wherein <hi>Judas</hi> ſhared alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.70.) he had choſen to eternal life, and whom not; And conſequently, knew who would prove faithful or falſe to him. 3. If any ſhould enquire, wherefore did he chooſe ſuch a man to be an Apoſtle, who he knew would prove a traitour? He anſwers, that hereby was fulfilled a prediction in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.9. that one of his familiars and domeſticks ſhould ingrately recompence his kindneſs, as if a beaſt fed by his Maſter, ſhould kick againſt him. And this is the firſt caution and inſtruction ſubjoyned to this intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſhould not ſtumble at the buſineſſe. As for this connexion of the prediction with the event, compare what is ſaid on <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.38. Only here it would be conſidered, that this is not a ſimple prediction relating only to Chriſt and <hi>Judas,</hi> but was in part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in <hi>Ahithophels</hi> treachery againſt <hi>David,</hi> who in his ſufferings of this kinde was a type of Chriſts ſufferings from <hi>Judas,</hi> in whom that was chiefly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. And albeit ſo much only be cited as is clearly applicable to Chriſt; that of a <hi>friend in whom I truſted,</hi> being more proper to <hi>David,</hi> ſeeing Chriſt never hoped for any good of <hi>Judas.</hi> (And ſo we ought to be wary in expounding Scripture-types) Yet even that may in ſome ſenſe be true of Chriſt, who entruſted <hi>Judas</hi> not only with the bag, but with the Miniſtry and Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it ſelfe, as well as the reſt. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt is very tender of his weak followers, and loath to grieve them, by bringing forth what may diſpleaſe or ſtumble them; Therefore doth he at firſt prepare their mindes for theſe ſad newes, with ſuch general intimations and cautions. 2. It is not ſufficient that men hear truths, unleſs they make application thereof to themſelves in particular; for, Chriſts exception ſuppoſeth an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what he ſaid, on their parts. 3. When truths are ſpoken in a general auditory, men are very ready to miſapply them; for, therefore is a guard and exception needful. In this caſe, (to ſay nothing of the ſtate of mens perſons, whereby they may know much what they have right unto) we would conſider. 1. Want of fear in application of what is comfortable, is a ſad evidence of wrong application. 2. What ever mens right be to what is comfortable, yet they cannot comfortably apply it, unleſs they ſtand in real and ſenſible need of what is offered, for their encouragement and furtherance in good; or do in ſincerity lay hold on the offer, to quicken them in their ſenſe of need. 3. Albeit they may have right to apply comforts, who ſometime will fall a ſleep upon them; yet the application is never comfortable, but when ſome fruits thereof appear. So alſo threatnings are not ſavingly applyed, but when they ſtir up to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. 4. Ordinarily, the hearts of good and bad are ſo froward, that they are beſt at applying what they have leaſt right unto; Saints when they are humbled, can lay hold on threatnings, but cannot hear of promiſes;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48148:143"/>
the wicked make no doubt of promiſes, but take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of threatnings; and Saints are moſt apt to graſp at promiſes when they are moſt ſecure. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 4. So general is the corruption of men, and their ſocieties, that comfortable things can hardly be ſpoken to the choiceſt and feweſt number of them, but there will be ſome to be excepted againſt, as having no right thereunto; for, when Chriſt is propounding to his very twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, a promiſe of happineſſe upon the practice of humility, there needs an exception, <hi>I ſpeak not of you all.</hi> 5. Miniſters are not faithful, nor do they declare the whole counſel of God, unleſs with general promiſes, they publiſh alſo needful cautions, that none do ſtumble upon, or abuſe them; for ſo much doth Chriſts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in excepting <hi>Judas,</hi> teach. And albeit they cannot do as Chriſt did in pointing at the man; Yet they muſt ſet down Scripture cautions and limits to the promiſes, and the Scripture qualifications of theſe who have right thereunto. 6. Whatever may be the excellencies of men, and eſpecially of Chriſts ſervants, in reſpect of their gifts and ſucceſs; Yet true happineſs belongs to none but to the choſen and Elect ones; for, albeit the Apoſtleſhip had very eminent effects, yet they are only happy in obedience, <hi>whom he hath choſen.</hi> See <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.17, 18, 19, 20. 7. Men may be choſen to very eminent employments, who yet are not choſen to eternal life; for, by this exception, <hi>Judas</hi> is ſecluded from among theſe <hi>whom he hath choſen.</hi> So that we have need not to do at ſo much on what is adorning, but to ſeek what is ſaving. 8. Whatever be the means whereby men are kept faithful, and carried on to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Yet the fountain of all this ſlows from the Lords electing them to theſe means, and to the end following thereupon; Therefore, the Apoſtles walking in the wayes of happineſs, is attribute not ſo much to their grace, as to his election, the fountain of their grace, <hi>I know whom I have choſen,</hi> and who therefore will be happy in doing theſe things. And this is held out, partly, that all the good we have, we may trace it up to this fountain; and partly, that having made our calling and election ſure, we may be comforted under the ſenſe of great inward weakneſſe. Hence it is that glorification is ſubjoyned to election and juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29. and election is laid as a ground of ſecurity againſt final defection in trying times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18, 19. 9. Chriſt is the authour of Election, as God equal with the Father, and he knoweth the number of his choſen ones, and who they are; for, <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 10. Chriſt is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what any of his followers will prove, and that from the beginning; for, <hi>Judas</hi> did not deceive him, <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> 11. There is much of Chriſt to be ſeen in the old Teſtament, by a diſcerning eye; and much acted in types which hath its full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in him: for, <hi>the ſcriptures,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Davids</hi> ſuffering in the type from <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> is <hi>fulfilled</hi> in <hi>Judas</hi> treachery againſt Chriſt. 12. In all the lots that befall Chriſt and his followers, we are to guard againſt ſtumbling at them, by conſidering a ſoveraigne providence of God in all of them; for, Chriſt here guards the diſciples mindes in this matter, by letting them ſee that God foreſaw it long before, and did foretell that which was now <hi>fulfilled.</hi> 13. Chriſt is moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of fulfilling all Scriptures, that ſo we may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to reſt our confidence on what he ſaith in them; Therefore doth he admit of a <hi>Judas</hi> into his fellowſhip, and permits him to betray him, <hi>that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> and there might be no cauſe of queſtioning the truth thereof. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. albeit he had affection to the Gentiles, yet <hi>for the truth of God,</hi> he confined himſelfe to the miniſtry of the circumciſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.14. Chriſt and his followers do ſuffer not only from open enemies, which were in many reſpects an caſe; But they are alſo perſecuted by falſe boſome friends and familiars; for ſo found <hi>David</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is the great treachery, and horrid ingratitude of enemies, that no favours nor familiarity will draw them from their enmity, but rather emboldens them thereunto; for albeit he <hi>eat bread with him,</hi> and his bread too, (as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9.) yet want only and ingrately, <hi>he hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> 16. Whatever be the carriage of enemies, yet it is the duty of Chriſts followers to heap coals on their heads, by doing them all the good they can in their ſtations; for, herein Chriſt hath left an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who albeit he knew what <hi>Judas</hi> was, yet let him <hi>eat bread with him.</hi> See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe a ſecond caution and inſtruction is joyned with this intimation; Wherein, (as in the former he gave a reaſon why he permitted ſuch a thing to be; ſo) he gives a reaſon why he now foretels of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery before hand: Namely, that when they ſhould compare his prediction with the event when it came to paſſe, they might be ſo far from ſtumbling at it, that, on the contrary it might aford them an encouragement to beleeve on him, who by the prediction did prove himſelf God omniſcient, and by his ſuffering theſe things, did prove himſelfe to be the true Meſſiah, of whom theſe things were fore-propheſied. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Chriſt is omniſcient as God, and knoweth, and can foretell things before they come to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e; for, <hi>now I tell you before it come.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.5. 2. Chriſt doth ſo order his own and his peoples afflictions, as in ſtead of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtumbling, a right obſerver may finde many confirmations and advantages by them; for, he ſo orders <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, (which would ſeem to have ruined all) as it may contribute to confirme them that he is God and the true Meſſiah. It is he indeed who brings meat out of the eater. 3. It is a notable fruit and advantage by ſaddeſt ſtormes, to be helped to know and beleeve more of Chriſt his excellency and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; for, this is the fruit here, <hi>that ye may beleeve that I am he.</hi> 4. Whatever degree of knowledge and faith in Chriſt Saints attain to, yet they need more increaſe and confirmation, and to attain this is a difficult task: for, albeit the diſciples knew and beleeved what he was, yet he findes this pains needful, that they may be helped to beleeve more. 5. Chriſt rightly taken up, will be beleeved to be matchleſſe, ſingular, and inexpreſſible, in his fulneſſe and excellency; for, this he aims at,

                     <hi>that ye may believe that I am he,</hi> or, <hi>that I am,</hi> to wit, that ſingular and inexpreſſible one. 6.

                  <p>In this verſe we have a third caution and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubjoyned to this intimation; Wherein Chriſt holds forth this encouragement to all his faithful meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and all who receive them and their meſſage; That theſe his ſervants are ſo dear to him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Father and he are ſo neatly intereſſed in them and their meſſage, that the reſpect ſhewed to them and it, redounds both to him and his Father. His ſcope in this doctrine is, partly, to remove another exception that might be propounded upon occaſion of <hi>Judas</hi> treachery; for, whereas upon his deſerting and betraying of his Maſter, men might be ready to think that he was but a bad Maſter, and that the office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip was of little worth, ſince he had ſo lightly deſerted it: Chriſt declares, that this office was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in it ſelfe, and (however <hi>Judas</hi> had played the traitour, yet) he would get men to exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce it, and to entertain them who did ſo, to their own rich advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And therefore his treachery did no way reflect on him or his ſervice, but did aggravate the traitours guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, who had deſerted ſo honourable an office, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only by Chriſt, but by his Father alſo. Partly alſo, his ſcope is, hereby to encourage the reſt of the Apoſtles, (as it is made uſe of, <hi>Matth</hi> 10.40.) who being to be left by their Maſter, and ſent out on ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein they might expect great difficulties, (as is declared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.) and being alſo preſſed with the neceſſity of humility and condeſcendence, they might be ready to think this a very hard and diſadvantageous ſervice. Withal, <hi>Judas</hi> his treachery, who was one of their number, might give them occaſion to ſuſpect that Chriſt would abhorre their ſociety for his ſake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he declares, that notwithſtanding all that had come, if they would go about the employment as he required, he ſhould own them in it, and whoſoever received them, ſhould receive him and the Father alſo. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Mens deſerting of Chriſt and his ſervice doth no way reflect on him or it, but upon the deſerters themſelves; nor will he want ſervants, and theſe who will entertain them, deſert him who will; for, ſo much doth this doctrine, as it is a caution againſt <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, teach, that he will have ſome to ſend, and ſome to receive them, when <hi>Judas</hi> is gone. 2. Our Lord Jeſus hath large underſtanding and capacity, to take many things into his minde, and meet with all neceſſary caſes at once; for, by this doctrine he not only obviates <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, but meets with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of the reſt of his diſciples, as hath been explained. 3. Albeit Chriſts doctrine, concerning the excellency of his ſervice, get but little credit in times of defection; And albeit his encouragements have but little place with theſe of weak hands: yet what he ſaith to the one or the other caſe, is moſt grave and undoubted truth; Therefore is doctrine, which ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the ſcandal of <hi>Judas</hi> defection, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth his diſciples, confirmed by his ordinary aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> 4. In times of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſuch as continue faithful ſhall be the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in Chriſts ſight, and be allowed ſpecial encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements by him; therefore doth he hold out ſuch a cordial to his honeſt diſciples, now when <hi>Judas</hi> is to forſake him. 5. Whatever be the difficulties attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts ſervice; yet the ſervice it ſelf hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement ſufficient in its boſome, againſt all of them; Therefore is this encouragement held forth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their difficulties in the exerciſe of their office. 6 The humble condeſcending man is ſo dear to Chriſt, that he ſhares in all his lots, is reſpected in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects put upon him, and accounts himſelf ſleighted in all the affronts offered to him; for, this doctrine alſo tends to encourage them to the humility he had preſſed upon them, by ſhewing that he will do all for the humble, and will ſhare with them in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the world. 7. Whatever be the want of outward ſplendour, or the ignominie and contempt of Chriſts ſervants in the world; yet it is ſufficient dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority to bear them out, that they are cloathed with a Meſſage and Commiſſion from him; for, it is here ſuppoſed as their dignity, and ſufficient to bear them out in the exerciſe of their office in the world, that he <hi>ſends</hi> them. 8. It is the duty of people in relation to Chriſts Meſſengers, to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their doctrine, and their perſons for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſake, and to guard againſt prejudices at their perſons, leſt they ſtumble at their meſſage: for, ſo is here imported, they ſhould <hi>receive whom I ſend.</hi> See 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 9. Chriſts faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are ſo taken up with zeal to their Maſter, and love to the welfare of ſouls, that their great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement within time is, when their Meſſage, and themſelves for its ſake, are received and get place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; for, this is their encouragement, that encouragement is given to men to <hi>receive</hi> them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great ſcope. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. 10. Such as would approve themſelves to be Chriſts Scholars, ought not to hearken unto, nor receive theſe who run without a calling, but only theſe whom <hi>he ſends,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. Nor ought they to reſpect them who are ſent, upon any carnal reſpect, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 16. but as they are ſent and faithful in their truſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41. nor are they to diſreſpect any who are ſent and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by Chriſt, but whatever different meaſure of gifts there be, they muſt reſpect, and reverence, and hearken to all of them, as they are called to it; All theſe are included in this, that they are to <hi>receive whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſend.</hi> 11. Whatever be the oppoſition unto, or contempt of Chriſts Meſſengers, yet there will ſtill be ſome to receive them, when he ſends them out; for, ſo is imported, that there will be ſome to <hi>receive whomſoever I ſend.</hi> 12. It is a comfortable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Miniſters in the diſcharge of their truſt, and to people to receive them and their doctrine, That as God is inſeparable from his Son Chriſt, in his Perſon
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48148:144"/>
and Office, ſo is Chriſt and his Father in him, inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from his ſervants; The reſpect that is payed to them firſt, is payed in them to Chriſt and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo, on the contrary, doth the contempt of them reflect on him: for, <hi>He that receiveth whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſend, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth him that ſent me,</hi> where, in the firſt place, their intereſt in Chriſt is aſſerted, and in the Father through him, and for further confirmation the Fathers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt is aſſerted, who is not received nor known, but in the receiving of Chriſt.</p>

The reaſon of this repeated and more particular diſcovery, may partly be gathered from the following purpoſe; that they did not underſtand, nor were affected as became with the former intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore he repeats and preſſeth it, till they be rowzed up by it: and partly, it is expreſſed in this verſe to be Chriſts trouble in ſpirit, while his thoughts are upon <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, a taſte of his own ſad ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings following thereupon, is let out upon his ſoul; and withal, his ſorrow and indignation at the odious and ingrate treaſon, and the ſad judgements to follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, (as it is deduced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.24.) did ſo take hold on him, that he muſt reveal it with ſerious teſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aſſeverations. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Soul-preſſures and troubles were no ſtrangers to our bleſſed Lord, and he would have it well ſtudied that he is acquainted with ſuch conditions; Therefore is his <hi>trouble in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> here again marked. 2. Saints ought not to think it ſtrange, if after deliverance from ſoul-trouble, they be again plunged into it; but muſt ſee that caſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified unto them in Chriſts perſon, who after that ſad fit, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.27. is again <hi>troubled in ſpirit.</hi> 3. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous hypocrites in the Church are a great trouble, and matter of much vexation to the godly, either through their grief at their carriage, or by reaſon of the troubles which they raiſe to others; for, upon Chriſts ſpeaking of <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, he is troubled at it in both theſe reſpects, as hath been cleared, <hi>When Jeſus had thus ſaid, he was troubled in ſpirit.</hi> 4. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous hypocrites, who are the inſtruments of Chriſt or his followers ſufferings, are in an horrible and woful condition, both in reſpect of guilt, and the judgments abiding them; for, Chriſt could not think of <hi>Judas</hi> treachery and end, without trouble; and ſo will it be with all right diſcerners, whatever theſe hypocrites think of themſelves. 5. Albeit ſoul-trouble be bitter, yet it is uſeful (eſpecially in Miniſters) to draw forth truth, with more clearneſſe and edge, to others, for, herein Chriſt hath given a proof, the fruit of whoſe ſoul-trouble is, that he ſpeaks out more diſtinctly what they underſtood not before, and brings it out ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, <hi>teſtifying</hi> it. 6. When Chriſt is about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his people, and they will not be put to it by ſome means, he will ſtill put them to it, till he rouze them up; for, they making no uſe of the former inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he inculcates it again, till it become an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to all of them. 7. Chriſt perfectly knowes all men, and particularly, theſe who are more near to him in relations and fellowſhip; for, he can give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct account that <hi>one of them</hi> is a traitour. 8. As g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eat naughtineſſe may be in theſe who are very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; ſo their eminency renders their guilt more odious and horrible; that <hi>one of you ſhould betray me.</hi> 9. It is hard to beleeve, if not almoſt incredible, what naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe there may be in eminent Profeſſours and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which yet Chriſt knoweth well enough; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt confirm it with, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, that one of you ſhall betray me.</hi> 10. Such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected with the ſin of treacherous hypocrites, will not bluntly ſpeak of it, in diſcovering or reproving it, but will evidence much zeal and indignation: for, Jeſus being <hi>troubled in ſpirit, teſtified,</hi> and gravely, and with much ſeriouſneſſe, intimates it. 11. In times wherein we may diſcern Satan to be employing eminent Profeſſours in an ill turn, it concernes every one to be upon their guard: Therefore is this intimation yet more general, <hi>one of you,</hi> not determining who, that all might be ſet on edge to try and ſearch, as afterward it followeth, and more fully in the other Evangeliſts.

Their looking one upon another may be ſuppoſed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to flow from their general amazement, and partly, from their deſire (who were conſcious to themſelves, of no ſuch intentions) to know by one anothers countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who was the guilty man. And it is like, that at firſt they gazed one upon another through amazement, not knowing who might be the man, from which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their particular enquiry at Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.21, 22. And that afterward being ſomewhat more confirmed, they looked if they could diſcover it by any Symptomes in others, which not ſucceeding, <hi>Peter</hi> takes another courſe, in the following purpoſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There may ſuch things fall forth in the Church, and be acted by members thereof, as will ſurprize true Profeſſours with aſtoniſhment and amazement, who could never have beleeved ſuch naughtineſſe to be in their ſocieties; for, ſo doth the diſciples carriage, upon this intimation, evidence. 2. When the Lord makes any intimation of a defection to be in the Church, ſincere Profeſſours will be jealous, and put to ſearch themſelves whether they be guilty or not; for, upon this intimation of but one among twelve, all of them <hi>looked one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doubting of whom he ſpake:</hi> and albeit they were not conſcious to themſelves of any ſuch wicked purpoſe,

yet ſince he had ſpoken, all of them are jealous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning themſelves, as the other Evangeliſts obſerve. As for <hi>Judas,</hi> it is only marked that he enquired laſt of all, rather to hide himſelf from the reſt, then for any other end. 3. It is an evidence of ſincere Profeſſors, that they truly abhorre all treachery againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and will deſire to know who are guilty of it, that they may abhorre it in them: for, their <hi>looking one on another,</hi> (together with their enquiry concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) <hi>doubting of whom he ſpake,</hi> intimates alſo their abhorrency of that crime, with their deſire to know who was guilty of it. 4. Albeit Chriſt, ſometime, give very clear intimation of ſome defection to be among his followers; yet he uſeth not to diſcover who the treacheron hypocrites are, till they decipher themſelves; for, albeit he had warned them of the treachery of one of their number, yet they <hi>doubted of whom</hi> in particular <hi>he ſpake,</hi> as not being particularly named. 5, Treacherous hypocrites may lurk ſo cloſe, and carry matters ſo faire, as none can ſpie them out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they diſcover themſelves, unleſſe Chriſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily reveal and point them out: for, <hi>Judas</hi> in this buſineſſe put on ſuch a countenance, as when they looked about, yet they ſtill <hi>doubted of whom he ſpake,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are put to another ſhift to finde him out.</p>

                  <p>Followeth a further effect of the former diſcovery, in <hi>Peter,</hi> occaſioning the third ſtep of the diſcovery, and a particular deſignation of the traitour unto <hi>John.</hi> The ſumme of this purpoſe is; the intimation that there was a traitor in their ſociety, and the impoſſibility to know who he was, either by that intimation or by his countenance, kindles in <hi>Peter</hi> an earneſt deſire to know him. And being neither willing to propound his deſire openly, ſeeing Chriſt had hitherto forborn to name him; not being able to propound it ſecretly to Chriſt, by reaſon of his diſtance: He makes a ſecret ſigne to <hi>John,</hi> the beloved diſciple who ſat neareſt Chriſt that he ſhould enquire; who accepting of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and propounding the matter to Chriſt, <hi>Judas</hi> is diſcovered to him by a ſigne ſecretly agreed upon betwixt Chriſt and him. For clearing this a little, conſider. 1. Whereas <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to <hi>lean on Jeſus boſome,</hi> it points at their cuſtome in ſitting at table, that they did lie upon beds or couches with their feet outward, and their heads inward, leaning themſelves on their elbows, and ſo the head of one lay neare to the boſome of another, as <hi>John</hi> did here to Chriſt: yet not ſo near but there was ſome diſtance, for <hi>John, v.</hi> 25. muſt <hi>lie on Jeſus breaſt,</hi> or, raiſe up himſelfe a little and <hi>fall upon</hi> it (as the original is) before he can propound the matter ſecretly. Conſider, 2. Chriſt chuſeth this way to diſcover <hi>Judas</hi> unto <hi>John,</hi> by <hi>giving a ſop when he had dipped it,</hi> (which was ſome part of that Supper before the Sacrament was inſtituted) partly becauſe this was a more ſecret way of deſigning him, ſeeing it was uſual for Chriſt to diſtribute meat amongſt them, and ſo none could know the matter but <hi>John</hi> who underſtood his purpoſe in it, and (belike) <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf. And partly becauſe this ſigne was moſt agreeable to the prediction, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.9. and might put <hi>Judas</hi> in minde of his ingratitude.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt love all his diſciples and followers; yet as man he had degrees of of love and familiarity with ſome beyond others; And as God alſo, he may let out ſenſible evidences of love to ſome, beyond others; for albeit he loved all his own, <hi>v.</hi> 1. yet here there is one diſciple <hi>whom Jeſus loved,</hi> in a ſingular way, to wit, as he was man, and in reſpect of kinde manifeſtations of himſelf. 2. Such as are indeed beloved of Chriſt, will eſteem highly of this as their chief dignity, and far above any love they can have to him; for, this is the character of the beloved diſciple; Albeit he loved Chriſt, yet there is no word of that, but of Chriſts love to him; and he gives himſelf no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name or title, as accounting it his chiefeſt glory to be called <hi>one of his diſciples whom Jeſus loved.</hi> So alſo <hi>c,</hi> 19.26. and 21.20. 3. Such are beloved of Chriſt, albeit they account it their great glory; yet they will entertain it with much modeſty and ſobriety; for <hi>John</hi> in writing the hiſtory, when he ſpeaks of theſe his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, yet never names himſelf who he was, till <hi>c.</hi> 21.20.24. that cloſing the hiſtory, he muſt declare who was the penman of it. 4. Such as are beloved of Chriſt will delight much in intimate familiarity with him, and will be admitted thereto; for it is <hi>Johns</hi> choice and Chriſts allowance, that he <hi>leaned on Jeſus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. An honeſt heart is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with its own teſtimony, unleſſe alſo it get Chriſts approbation; for, <hi>Peter</hi> would know <hi>who it ſhould be of whom he ſpake,</hi> not only that he might know him, but that himſelf alſo might be aſſoiled by Chriſt. 2. It is neceſſary for theſe whoſe infirmities do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burſt forth, that they do witneſſe their integrity, by zeal and forwardneſſe for Chriſt, and by being as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in duty, as ſometime they are in their failings; for here <hi>Peter,</hi> who was oftimes further wrong then the reſt, manifeſts more zeal then all the reſt, and is as eminent in his indignation againſt treachery. And indeed his failings were (for moſt port) not in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of luke warmneſſe, but of raſh zeal and reſpect to Chriſt. 3. It is commendable when the fruit of many reproofs appears in taking with faults, and reforming them in practiſe; for, this is alſo to be obſerved in his carriage, who being often reproved for his raſh forwardneſſe, doth now modeſtly <hi>becken to John, that he ſhould ask,</hi> though ſhortly after he returned to his old raſhneſſe. 4. It may be eaſily diſcerned by any, that ſuch as are moſt beloved of Chriſt, will get moſt of his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48148:146"/>
minde; Therefore, <hi>Peter beckoned to him, that he ſhould ask,</hi> not only becauſe he was neareſt Chriſt, but becauſe being beloved of him, he hoped he would tell him as ſoon as any.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such as love Chriſt, and are beloved of him, may be very bold with him, without miſconſtruction; for lying on Chriſts breaſt, he propounds the queſtion. 2. Loves boldneſſe doth not ſeclude revence, but takes it along with it; for in the midſt of this boldneſſe, he calls him <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>lieth on Jeſus breaſt,</hi> to enquire ſecretly, till he ſhould know his pleaſure, whether he would reveal it or not. 3. As latent hypocrites are known only to Chriſt, ſo they muſt be left to him to diſcover them, and we muſt not ſit down on his throne of judgement; for; <hi>John</hi> goeth to Chriſt to know this traitor, <hi>Lord who is it?</hi> 4. They are not miſtaken, who expect that much of Chriſts minde will be revealed to ſuch as are beloved of him, and that in their familiar and reverent addreſſes; they will be made welcome; for, <hi>John</hi> gets a good anſwer as <hi>Peter</hi> expected. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, he it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Chriſt may be doing good to them who are but traitours to him, and by his outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, be diſcovering to right diſcerners, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approven they are of him; for, he gives a ſop to <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> the traitour, and by this diſcovers to <hi>John</hi> that he is a traitour. 6 Saints to whom Chriſt reveales not ſuch things as they deſire, muſt reverence his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; And when he doth not cleare their doubts fully to them, they are to reſt ſatisfied in the teſtimony of a good conſcience; for, <hi>Peter</hi> having done his duty to know the traitour, muſt reſt ſatisfied that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to <hi>John,</hi> and when Chriſt doth not clear him expreſly that it was not himſelf, he is left to look to the conſcience of his own integrity.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have the conſequents of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation in <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, occaſioning a fourth ſtep of this diſcovery, wherein Chriſt declares more of his mind to <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf concerning his treaſon. The ſumme of this purpoſe is to be conceived thus; <hi>Judas</hi> guilty conſcience making him ſuſpect all things, he could not but obſerve the whiſperings betwixt Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> and that Chriſt after that had given him a ſop, which (it is like) drew <hi>John,</hi> who knew the ſcope of that ſign, to eye him in an odd way. Therefore perceiving or fearing that he was diſcovered, he is ſo imbittered and vexed at it, that he gives himſelf wholly up to Satan, and reſolves to proſecute his treaſon ſpeedily and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. Upon which, (and poſſibly he was now on his feet to go out to the chief Prieſts) Chriſt lets him know that he knew his deſigne, and bids him do his worſt, <hi>v.</hi> 27. which as the reſt underſtood not, but ſome of them ſuppoſed that, as purſe-maſter, he was ſent out to provide ſomewhat againſt the ſolemnity of the next day, or ordained to give ſomewhat unto the poor, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. ſo he is more hardened thereby to go on in his wicked courſe, and accordingly goeth out to effectuate it, though it was dark night, <hi>verſe</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Satan gets poſſeſſion by degrees of wicked men; ſo it is hard when once he gets footing, to prevent a more full poſſeſſion; for, Satan, who before tryſted with him, by caſting tentations into his heart, now gets full poſſeſſion, and <hi>entred into him.</hi> 2 Traitours and hypocrites are ſo far from being reclaimed by the diſcovery of their naughtines, that they are rather more irritate thereby; for, upon his perceiving that Chriſt had diſcovered him to <hi>John,</hi> by giving the ſop, <hi>Satan entred into him.</hi> 3. Chriſt in his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and righteous judgement, may do to hypocrites that, whereupon they may take occaſion to harden themſelves unto perdition, and to forſake him, yet without all imputation to him; for upon this diſcovery he is ſet on edge by Satan againſt Chriſt, as if he had affronted him. 4. Satan gets ready entry in a man, nor can he long ſtand, when he is given over of God; for, <hi>Judas</hi> is given up by Chriſt to himſelf, to do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he did, when Satan poſſeſſed him to do this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. 5. As Chriſt knows all the naughtineſſe of traitors, ſo he is the permitter of the ſame, without any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their ſinne; for, <hi>That thou doeſt, do quickly,</hi> is not a command, but a declaration of his preſcience and permiſſion. 6. When Chriſt hath long ſtruggled with corrupt men, to reſtraine and curb their naughtineſſe; he may at laſt, let looſe the reins to them, to do their worſt, for, having a traitour ſo long reſtrained in his company, he at laſt gives him up to himſelf. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. 7. Chriſts willingneſs to ſuffer for his people, made all attempts againſt him to be nothing terrible; for, this permiſſion imports alſo that he was willing to ſuffer, and therefore cared not how ſoon he would put him to it. And thus our willing reſolutions would take off much of the terrour of our ſufferings. 8. Chriſt needs never reſtrain any of his enemies, for any fear he hath of them; but can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his purpoſe, and triumph over their moſt violent oppoſitions; for, this upgiving is alſo a defying of <hi>Judas</hi> to do his worſt, and when he had ſo done, yet Chriſt ſhould redeem his people, and triumph over all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he brought him into by his treachery. 9. Men given over by God unto Satan, will be very wreſtleſſe to execute miſchief, and may ſpeed well at it, for a time; for, <hi>do quickly,</hi> is alſo a prediction of his activity and ſucceſſe, as to the outward ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is no fault in ſincere profeſſours, to be charitable even of hypocrites, ſo long as they keep cloſe; for, it flowed, in part, from their
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48148:147"/>
charity, that <hi>no man at the table knew for what intent he ſpake this unto him,</hi> and ſome ſuppoſed ſome other thing. And it ſeems that <hi>John</hi> himſelf to whom he was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly diſcovered, did not ſuſpect he would preſently go about his treaſon, and therefore underſtood not this diſcourſe, though poſſibly he joyned not in the opinion ſome others had of him and it. And as for the reſt, albeit it ſeemes they ſhould have known his treachery from Chriſts anſwer to his queſtion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.25. Yet it ſeems that Chriſt gave him that anſwer ſecretly, or he propounded that queſtion but immediately before he went out. 2. Chriſt did ſo willingly ſuffer for his people, that by his own over-ruling hand he kept back all things that might hinder inſtruments to act therein; for, this ignorance alſo flowed from the hand of God, leſt they ſhould have hindred him, and ſo ſhould have marred the work Chriſt came about. See <hi>Mat</hi> 16.20. and 26.52, 53, 54. 3. It is the will of Chriſt, that were mens portion but mean, yet they ſhould not only provide for their own neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies thereby, and ſo live in an honeſt way; but they ſhould alſo be beneficial to the poor and indigent, for this conſtruction, which ſome of them put upon Chriſts words, teacheth, that it was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome as at other times, ſo now, out of his ſmall ſtock, <hi>to buy theſe things we have need of againſt the feaſt,</hi> (or the ſolemnity of the firſt day of unleavened bread, being the morrow after the paſſeover, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.16, 17.) and to <hi>give ſomething to the poor,</hi> and his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this is our rule.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Checks given by Chriſt to enemies, which might reclaime them, do but irritate and render them worſe; for, after all this, he <hi>having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſop, went out.</hi> 2. Men given over by God, and poſſeſſed by Satan, are ſo impudent, that they will not only attempt higheſt wickedneſſe, even againſt Chriſt, but will commit it even in Chriſts preſence, and when they know that he knoweth and ſeeth them; for, albeit Chriſt had intimate that he knew what he was doing, yet he <hi>went out</hi> to act it 3. Satan is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in driving theſe acted by him, very haſtily, and over all impediments, to commit miſchief; for, <hi>having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſop, he went immediately out,</hi> and that though <hi>it was night,</hi> as being too good for works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

Concerning this doctrine we may compare what is ſaid, on <hi>ch.</hi> 12.23. Here we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hypocrites cannot pollute an Ordinance of God to any but themſelves; yet they are oft-times, ſuch a burden and impediment to the ſocieties of Gods people, as the company will fare the better, when they are out of it; Therefore, Chriſt who was ſpeaking ſad things while <hi>Judas</hi> was with them, and weighted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>v.</hi> 21. now, <hi>when he is gone out,</hi> his minde is elevate, and he ſpeaks comfortably and familiarly to the reſt. 2. As there is no condition ſo hard, but a childe of God, through him, will get through it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. And as there is no humbling preſſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lot, but they may expect a blenk of comfort and eaſe after it: So oft-times, the Lord makes their ſad lots eaſieſt, when they are neareſt to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by his giving at that time the ſpirit of that employment; for, Chriſt who before was troubled, <hi>v.</hi> 21. now when <hi>Judas</hi> goeth out to act his miſchievous treachery, is elevated in minde and comforted. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.16. And by this his comfort and rejoycing at this time, he learns us how to rejoyce when our diſſolution is near, though we were to go through a red ſea of blood and ſuffering unto that promiſed land. 3. Such as would rightly bear a croſſe, ought to take a look of their condition, quite contrary to the verdict of ſenſ;e and reaſon; for, ſo doth Chriſt look on his ſufferings, as a <hi>glorifying</hi> of him, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in the effects thereof, which is a point fleſh and blood would never reveal. 4. How ignominious ſoever Chriſts ſufferings were in themſelves; yet they were not only the way to his glory, <hi>ch.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. and the fruits thereof glorious; and ſuch as exalted him in the world; But they were alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in themſelves, and he glorified therby; in reſpect of his obedience to his Father, even to the death; his love that ſhined therein; the teſtimony of innocency he received from enemies; the glorious miracles in the time of his ſufferings; and, in reſpect that hereby he redeemed his elect, trampled upon, and ſpoiled Satan, and triumphed over ſinne, and blotted out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances againſt us. For, ſaith he, <hi>the Sonne of man is glorified,</hi> and that, <hi>now,</hi> not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but inſtantly. And if he counted ſeeming igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny to be his glory, in reſpect of the ſervice done thereby to people; how much more ſhould we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that our glory which may honour him. 5. Such as are truly zealous of Gods honour, will count no condition honourable, unleſſe God be glorified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and where he gets honour a very ignominious condition will be honourable in their eyes; for this, <hi>glorifies the Sonne,</hi> that <hi>God is glorified in him.</hi> 6. As Chriſt was glorified by his own ſufferings; ſo alſo the Father was glorified in him; Not only in that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sonne, all the glory of the Sonne is his alſo; but that Chriſt in ſuffering, did glorifie him, in giving obedience to his will; The truth of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and his juſtice did ſhine in what he inflicted on his Son, and his wiſdom and goodneſſe did ſhine in the redemption of loſt man by ſuch a mean; for, ſaith he, <hi>and God is glorified in him.</hi> And albeit none can ſo glorifie God in ſuffering as Chriſt did; yet through him, he takes glory to himſelf in the ſufferings of his ſervants, as they are a teſtimony to his truth, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his excellency, that they will not love their lives unto the death for his ſake. See <hi>c.</hi> 21.19.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe he confirmes, the one branch of the former doctrine by the other; and ſheweth that if God be glorified in him and in his ſufferings, then certainly, he would glorifie him in himſelfe: And again inculcates that this ſhould be ſtraitway done, in his approaching ſufferings, and the glory haſtening upon the back of that. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit God be glorious, and to be glorified in all his working; Yet his ſpecial glory, wherein he delights moſt, is that which is offered to him, and ſhines in his Son; for, this is the glory of God which Chriſt inſiſts ſo much on, that he is <hi>glorified in him</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. 2. Gods being honoured in any condition, or by any under ſuch a condition, is a ſufficient evidence that the condition is honourable, be what it will, and that they themſelves are and ſhall be honoured therein; for, ſo doth Chriſt argue, <hi>If God be glorified in him, God ſhall alſo glorifie him in himſelf.</hi> See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. It is honour abundance to get leave to honour God, and it portends much dignity to them who ſo do. 3. It is a ſure evidence of future glory, when men make it their chief ſtudy to honour God here; for, ſo much alſo doth Chriſts arguing teach. See 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.7, 8. 4. Whatever our diſcouragements may object, to weaken our own hands from doing or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a hard time; Yet it is our duty to reaſon againſt unbelief, for our own encouragement; for, ſo doth Chriſts debating and reaſoning the certainty of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching glory, teach. 5. God will not only give fair promiſes to them who glorifie him; but will at laſt give performance; And as we may alwaies, in ſome reſpect, look on this not as far off, but near hand. So after a whiles exerciſe, our expectation will, at laſt, come to an iſſue. Therefore doth he adde, he ſhall <hi>ſtraitway glorifie him.</hi> 6. Chriſt and his followers true glory may be ſo little delayed by clouds of ſufferings, that it may be very near when they are engaging in the throng of afflictions; for, at that time, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he ſhall ſtraightway glorifie him.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The ſecond point propounded here to his diſciples, is, a ſweet and warme way of intimating his departure, unto them; Wherein, letting out his affection in a warme title and compellation, he intimates that he was ſhortly to depart from them, in reſpect of his bodily preſence; and that (as he had ſaid unto the Jewes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.34. and 8.21.) though they ſhould ſeek him, yet they were not able to come whether he went, and was. Whereby we are to underſtand, partly, that while they entertained any carnal conceits of the Meſſiah, as the Jewes did, they ſhould not finde ſatisfaction in them, nor ſhould they (as they were wont when they miſſed him) be able to follow him, and enjoy his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And ſo when they ſought him at the grave, they could not finde him. But chiefly, we are to underſtand, that as the unbeleeving Jewes were ſecluded from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in heaven, ſo was their coming to him there, delayed, and a thing above their power, till he ſhould come and fetch them. And particularly, their following him to heaven, through the valley of ſuffering, was delayed for a time, to as many of them as were to be called thereunto, as is cleared, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſts preſence be the ſweet cordial of his followers; Yet he ſeeth it meet, for wiſe ends, and for their exerciſe, to withdraw it from them ſometimes; As here he did from his diſciples. 2. Chriſt, having fulfilled his Miniſtry on earth, did withdraw in reſpect of his bodily preſence, not only from his foes, but even from his followers; for, even to the diſciples it is now, <hi>a little while I am with you.</hi> 3. It is Chriſts kindneſſe to his followers, that he advertiſeth them of what is to come upon them, that ſo they may be armed againſt it, and prepared for it; as here he beforehand intimateth his removal to his diſciples. 4. It is our duty to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for how ſmall a moment we may have the occaſion and opportunitie of mercies, that we may be very buſie, and emprove it well; for, therefore doth he advertiſe his diſciples, <hi>a little while I am with you,</hi> that they might not trifle away that moment of time wherein he was ſo buſie with them in the following Chapters. 5. When Chriſt doth any thing that his followers think hard to digeſt, they are bound to beleeve that he doth it not for want of care and reſpect, but in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his love to them; And that they have ſo much more roome in his heart, that his dealing is ſad; and that he leaveth his heart with them, when otherwiſe he withdraweth; Therefore doth he ſweeten this ſad intimation with a ſweet title, not ſo uſual before, <hi>little children</hi> 6. A ſweet word, importing Chriſts love, is ſufficient to bear up Saints under ſaddeſt diſpenſations; for, this is a ſufficient cordial here, to make up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, that he calls them <hi>little children.</hi> 7. Such as do not undervalue the ſweet conſolations of Chriſts Word, and his ſpeaking to them, will finde him ſpeak more ſweetly in trouble then ever before; Therefore doth he reſerve ſuch a title for ſuch a time. 8. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be Chriſts dealing, in removing and withdrawing from his followers; Yet he ſtill retains the relation of a Father to them, and will have ſuch a care of them as Parents have of their young and tender children, who cannot care for themſelves, and who uſe to be moſt dandled and tenderly dealt with; for, ſo much doth this compellation, not only of <hi>children,</hi> but <hi>little children,</hi> import. 9. It is not inconſiſtent with Chriſts love to his own, that he deal and ſpeak as ſharply againſt their corruptions, as againſt the corruptions of the wicked; for, in ſo far as the diſciples were carnal, he <hi>ſaith unto them, as he ſaid unto the Jewes,</hi> as hath been explained. 10. Chriſt, by removing his bodily preſence, hath cut off all grounds of hope of any carnal way of intercourſe or communion with him, and laid on a neceſſity of ſtudying a ſpiritual way of coming to him, on all theſe who would enjoy him; for, ſo much alſo doth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, common to them with the Jewes, import. 11. The wicked and the godly, even in their beſt frame, may be under the ſame outward diſpenſation, but in as far different a way as is betwixt their ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48148:148"/>
for, even in reſpect of their coming to him in heaven, he ſaith, <hi>As I ſaid unto the Jewes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo now I ſay unto you,</hi> but in a far different ſenſe; for, To the one, he intimates his departure in judgement, by way of rejection of them; To the other, it is full of mercy, and accompanied with ſweet affection; To the one, coming to him is abſolutely denied, To the other, only delayed; To the one is intimate, that, as they cannot, ſo they ſhall not come where he is; To the other, it only intimates what they cannot do of themſelves, but doth not ſeclude what he can do or will do for them. 12. Whatever men eſteem of an enjoyed Chriſt, yet when he is gone, he will be miſſed by his own; for, when he is gone, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me,</hi> ſaith he. 13. Chriſts withdrawings tend to kindle deſires after him, and to be at him, in the hearts of his own, together with earneſt purſuing after him; for, ſo much alſo is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me.</hi> 14. Chriſt, by removing his bodily preſence from earth, hath taught his diſciples, to ſpend their lives in a ſober deſire, and haſtening to be with him in heaven; for, when he is gone, <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me to come whether I go,</hi> ſaith he. 15. Saints muſt not expect alwayes to get ſatisfaction, at firſt, in their moſt honeſt deſires and endeavours, but to be excuſed with further deſiring and ſeeking: And particularly, they muſt not expect to get up to reſt with Chriſt in heaven, till firſt they have wraſtled a while, and ſerved their generation: for, in this reſpect, though they ſeek him, yet <hi>whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> 16. Chriſts own by all their endeavours are not able to get up to him in heaven, unleſs he come and fetch them: for, in this reſpect alſo it holds true, <hi>ye cannot come,</hi> to wit, not only preſently, but of your ſelves, even no more then the Jewes can do.</p>

                        <bibl>Verſe 34.</bibl> A new commandement I give unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third point propounded by Chriſt, containeth a direction concerning their behaviour in his abſence, that they ſhould love one another: Which he preſſeth upon ſeveral grounds, whereof the firſt is, that the command enjoining it is a new commandment given by him: and the ſecond (in this verſe alſo) is taken from his own example, which might both perſwade them unto, and regulate them in, the performance of that duty. While he calleth this commandment <hi>new,</hi> the meaning is not that it was not enjoyned before: for, we finde it enjoyned in the law it ſelfe. And this ſame Apoſtle doth recommend the whole doctrine of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, as being ſo <hi>new,</hi> as yet it was old, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8 and particularly, he recommendeth love as an old commandment, and not new only, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. Nor doth it fully exhauſt the meaning, that he made it <hi>new,</hi> by renewing of that commandment and vindicating it from the corrupt gloſſes of the time, as he did alſo the teſt of the law: Nor yet ſufficeth it to ſay, that as it is a commandment which can only be performed by the new man: ſo it is enjoyned in a new way by Chriſt, in conferring power and grace with the command, and writing it on our heart, that it may be obeyed, which no man had under the law, by the law it ſelfe. For this is true alſo of other commands, and beleevers alſo under the law had it, though by another covenant, then that of the law, as it was a covenant of works. Therefore I conceive that by calling this commandment in ſpecial, <hi>new,</hi> is pointed out (beſide the former conſiderations) partly, that the thing commanded is excellent, and ſo a <hi>new ſong,</hi> ſeemeth to be underſtood for an excellent ſong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.3. And therefore Chriſt pitcheth on it, as a chief and ſingular duty above many, to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his diſciples. And ſo, if we look to this command, it is not only new, or renewed, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; Chriſts recommending it anew, adding a new obligation to what was lying on by the authority of the law; But the very matter of the command is <hi>new,</hi> and declared excellent, in that Chriſt doth ſo much and ſo ſpecially recommend it above others, and addes his authority and credite with his diſciples to the former injunction of the law, to make it to be ſtudyed. And partly, hereby is pointed out that it is <hi>new,</hi> in reſpect that it is urged upon a new ground, and after a new pattern and example; Our love to others not being now to be regulated only according to our love to our ſelves, as the tenour of the law runs, but a new ground and pattern being laid in <hi>Chriſts loving of us,</hi> which makes the whole complexe commandment, be <hi>a new commandment.</hi> And upon all theſe conſiderations it followeth, that this commandment ſhould ſtill be <hi>new</hi> to us, our obligation to ſuch a commander ſtill ſweetly binding, the ſubject matter ſo recommended by him, ſtill new and freſh, and ſweetly alluring to obedience, and ſuch a pattern ſtill drawing our hearts to imitate it. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The doctrine of the Goſpel contains not only ſweet comforts, but neceſſary commands and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections alſo, for our attaining, emproving, and clearing our right in theſe comforts; for, here is <hi>a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given,</hi> and preſſed by Chriſt in his ſweet farewel Sermon. 2. Chriſt is true God, and ſoveraigne Lord over, and law-giver unto his people, having authority to give a law unto them, binding their conſcience; for, <hi>a commandment I give unto you,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Sad lots may be made up and compenſed, not only by ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from Chriſt, but may be made eaſie, and much ſweetned alſo, by our cleaving to duty in ſuch a lot; for, here, mutual love is recommended, as a mean to ſweeten that ſad lot of his removal; So our love to him is left us to make up his being not ſeen, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. And indeed, they are never ſadly deſerted, (however they want comfort) who are not driven from duty; Nor is comfort allowed on any, but theſe who cleave to duty. 4. While Saints are abſent from Chriſt, in reſpect of his bodily preſence, it is eſpecially required of them, that they entertain mutual love; That ſo they may be mutually uſeful and comfortable one to another in ſuch a languiſhing time, and while they are hated in the world; That they may not fall in emulation and quarrels, during their Maſters abſence, and ſo marre his work, and their own peace, and expoſe his wayes to reproach and obloquie: And, That they may be fitted to partake of the ſweetneſſe, bleſſing, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which God hath commanded upon his people in their being united, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1, 2. 3. For theſe cauſes (among others) doth Chriſt in his abſence enjoyne, that they <hi>love one another,</hi> and ſo may partake of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48148:148"/>
conſolations left in his Teſtament. 5. Albeit, oft-times, we look on love as an indifferent and arbitrary thing, which we may practice or forbear at our pleaſure, and according as we judge our ſelves obliged or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged; Yet Chriſt hath not left it arbitrary to us, but enjoyned it as a debt and duty by his command; for, ſaith he, <hi>A commandment I give you, that ye love one another.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. 6. Whatever Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, his enjoyning of it puts a new obligation upon his children, and commends the thing enjoyned, as excellent for his ſake, which therefore ſhould not be entertained with formal and dead diſpoſitions; for, it is <hi>a new commandment,</hi> as hath been cleared. 7. Chriſt hath loved his diſciples and followers, and ſo loved them, as may well be a copy and pattern of all love; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have loved you,</hi> and ſo loved, that he makes it their copy, to <hi>love one another as I have loved you.</hi> As <hi>Jonathans</hi> love ſurpaſſed the love of women. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. So doth his love infinitely ſurpaſſe <hi>Jonathans.</hi> And this is the reaſon why he preſſeth love ſo much, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo much in his own heart. 8. Chriſts love to us is a new obligation, preſſing on us to love one another; Whoſoever believe his love, cannot but love him againe, and will account themſelves obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey what he commands and recommends by his own example; And particularly; to love them who have obtained like mercy with themſelves, and do beare his image, and are begotten of him, who hath loved them; And they will be ſenſible of ſo much tenderneſſe in him toward them, as will oblige them to be tender and condeſcending toward their brethren; for this is an argument, and makes it <hi>a new commandment,</hi> in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, <hi>that ye love one another as I have loved you.</hi> And that ſo much the rather, as the one is the evidence of the other. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.23 — 35. 9. Chriſts love is not only an argument obliging, but a patterne directing Saints in their mutual love, and albeit none can imitate him in the nature and kinde of ſome acts evidencing his love, (as being acts peculiar to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of mediatour:) Nor yet can any come up to his meaſure, in what is imitable: yet his love to us is a copy after which we ſhould ſtrive to write in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; By being willing, ingenuous, and free, in our love, as he was; By loving ſincerely, and not for by ends; By loving the Saints as ſuch, and becauſe of their intereſt in him, as he <hi>loved his own,</hi> John 13.1. (and ſo love them all as he did, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. not as <hi>James</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. and ſpecially them that are moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as <hi>John</hi> 13.1. with <hi>John</hi> 21.20.) By loving them, however they may hate us, as he loved them when enemies; By loving them not in word or tongue only, but in deed and real truth, as he gave his life for them he loved, by bearing their infirmities, and not pleaſing our ſelves, but them for their good to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as he alſo did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. And, by loving them conſtantly, as he loveth his own, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. ſo much is imported in this: <hi>A commandment I give you, that as I have loved you, ye alſo love one another.</hi>

Chriſt knows his own followers, and their weakneſs, better then they do themſelves; And his verdict of them will prove true, whatever they think of themſelves; for, he repeats that doctrine which <hi>Peter</hi> queſtioned, as ſtill true, <hi>whither I go thou canſt not follow me.</hi> 6 As no man is able of himſelfe to follow Chriſt, or ſuffer for him; So they may be true Saints, who yet are ſo weak for a time, as they are not able to ſuffer; for <hi>Peter</hi> is a diſciple, and yet <hi>cannot follow Chriſt now.</hi> 7.

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have the ſecond diſcourſe betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Peter;</hi> wherein, <hi>Peter</hi> not digeſting that he could not now follow, and looking on a violent death as the greateſt impediment, he conceives it not impoſſible to hazard on that, and therefore raſhly offers to follow him, though he ſhould lay down his life for his ſake, ver. 37. which preſumption being deteſted by Chriſt, he repreſſeth it by a prediction that he ſhould deny him thrice, that ſame very night, before the cock ſhould crow, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men are not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their preſumption, till experience diſcover it, nor do they alwayes ſee reaſon to doubt of their own ſtrength, even albeit Chriſt ſhould warn them of it; Therefore replieth he againſt Chriſts warning, <hi>why cannot I follow thee now?</hi> 2. The greateſt external impediment to hinder a man from following Chriſt, is a violent death for his ſake; for, ſo doth <hi>Peter</hi> ſuppoſe here. 3. Albeit it be a very great difficulty in it ſelfe, to ſuffer death for Chriſt and his truth; Yet it is not a thing to be ſtood upon, when we are called to it; And love to Chriſt ſhould make it eaſie, and us willing to undergo it; for, this is in it ſelfe commendable, that he was ſo willing to die, <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake.</hi> 4. As it is commendable to be valiant, couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and reſolved for troubles for Chriſts ſake, ſo oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in ſtead of this, Saints may be peſtered with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous reſting on their own ſtrength to endure ſufferings for Chriſt; for, this offer flowed not from true magnanimity, but raſh preſumption in <hi>Peter,</hi> who vilipends death, and yet trembled at a damſels voice. 5. The evidences of this preſumption (as it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from true courage and reſolution in God) may be gathered from <hi>Peter</hi> here. As 1. Men are preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, when they heed not the words verdict concerning their weakneſſe, nor are humbled by what it diſcovers; for, he heeds not, but contradicts Chriſts verdict. 2. Mens condition looks like preſumption, when they lean to their preſent diſpoſition and affections, and are not ſent out of themſelves, to deny all theſe, and truſt in God only; for, <hi>Peter</hi> here builds too much on his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſit of affection and reſolution. 3. If men would avoid preſumption, they ought not to boaſt of their courage before they have a do, and be called to it, and get the promiſe of fortitude, for, <hi>Peter</hi> is now ſtout, when it is not his work, and he hath not the promiſe till afterward. 4. It is a great token of preſumption, when men look only on outward impediments, and do not ſeriouſly conſider their own inward fainting diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for, he ſpeaks only of death, as an impediment, but conſiders not his own diſpoſition, and how much is requiſite within a man for ſuch an undertaking, without which leſſer ſufferings will be formidable.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48148:149"/>
5. Preſumption is alwayes attended with that want of ſobriety, whereof true courage is free; for, in all this he boaſts, without any fear or trembling, See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Preſumption is deteſtable and abominable to Chriſt, were it even in his own followers; for, ſo much doth this queſtion, by way of indignation, import, <hi>wilt thou lay down thy life for my ſake?</hi> 2. Chriſt knoweth all his followers well, and what they will prove, even when he chooſeth them, and leteth out his love upon them; as being God over all, and having diligently pondered all predictions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as man; for, he can tell <hi>Peter</hi> what he will prove, and ſo all the diſciples, from the predictions of the Prophets, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31. 3. Preſumption and carnal confidence will never do ſervice to Chriſt, But, on the contrary, men may be very preſumptuous and confident of themſelves, when they are very near a fall; for preſumptuous <hi>Peter</hi> is to <hi>deny</hi> his Maſter, and that <hi>before the cock crow,</hi> which was the ſigne whereof Chriſt made uſe afterward, to reclaim him. 4. It is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how contrary mens carriage, in a time of tentation, may be to their preſumptuous reſolutions; Therefore Chriſt muſt confirme it with a <hi>verily, verily.</hi> 5. When no other thing will convince men of their preſumption and carnal confidence, Chriſt will refute them by letting them feele their own weight; for, when <hi>Peter</hi> will not beleeve Chriſt <hi>ver.</hi> 36, he gets this, to ſhew him his folly? Yea, it ſeems from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.34, 35. that he ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When men once give way and yeel to tentation, they would make no end of defection, if mercy did not ſtop their courſe; for, <hi>Peter</hi> is warned that he ſhall deny <hi>Chriſt thrice,</hi> and would have gone on, if Chriſt had not reclaimed him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former chapter. Chriſt, as a faithful friend, not willing to delude his diſciples with falſe comforts, hath ripped up all their wounds: by telling them what they were to meet with. Now, in this and the two following Chapters, He, by comfortable doctrine, proves himſelfe to be the ſympathizing high Prieſt, and kithes his skill in curing theſe wounds. And for this end, as he points out his ſenſe of their caſe in themſelves, through his abſence; and that they would be troubled, orphans, hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted: So he hold, forth rich conſolations unto them and antidotes againſt theſe evils; together with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning their duty, for attaining and entertaining, theſe conſolations, which ſhould tend to their peace and joy.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter Chriſts chief ſcope is, to guard and encourage their hearts againſt that feare and trouble which ſciſed upon them, when they heard of his death and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the treachery and faintheartedneſſe that was among themſelves, as may be gathered from <hi>ver. 1.</hi>—and <hi>ver.—27.</hi> where he diſſwades them from theſe paſſions and diſtempers: For which end, he propounds ſeveral antidotes and grounds of conſolation and encouragement, which may be reduced to theſe heads. <hi>1.</hi> Faith in him, as true God, equal with the Father, <hi>ver.—1. 2.</hi> The conſideration of his errand in going, and that there was a neceſſity of his departure to heaven, for their good, <hi>ver. 2. 3.</hi> That he would come againe (having done his work) to fetch them, <hi>ver. 3. 4.</hi> That in the mean time, they know whither he went, and what was the way thither; Both which are propounded, <hi>ver. 4.</hi> and further cleared in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Thomas</hi> objection, <hi>ver. 5, 6.7.</hi> and the firſt of them yet further inſiſted on, upon occaſion of <hi>Philips</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>ver. 8.-14. 5.</hi> That if they would prove their love to him by obedience, and not by heartleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection for his abſence, <hi>ver. 15.</hi> He would ſend the Spirit unto them. The excellency of which gift, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to be had by him, are recorded, <hi>ver. 16.-26. 6.</hi> That he leaves his peace in legacy to them; Upon which he repeats the exhortation, <hi>ver. 27.</hi> And (being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this part of his diſcourſe) he reproves them for not entertaining this intimation of his departure and return, with joy, ſeeing it tended to his glory and their advantage, <hi>ver. 28.</hi> and the prediction of it would do them good after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>ver. 29.</hi> And declareth, that he was not to ſpeak much more unto them, but was ſhortly to be aſſaulted by Satan, and to ſuffer, not for any thing in himſelfe, but in obedience to his Fathers will, <hi>ver. 30, 31.</hi> and therefore they ought to heed better what he ſaid.</p>

Chriſts ſcope in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is to guard againſt, and diſſwade from that heart-trouble and perplexity, which his former doctrine had raiſed in them. 2. The firſt antidote or argument of conſolation to cure this diſtemper, which is double; For, herein he ſuppoſeth that however he was to die as man, yet he is God equal with the Father, and the object of faith. Next, he propoſeth faith in himſelfe with the Father, as a cordial to uphold their fainting and perplexed hearts. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts deareſt diſciples and true followers are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to much trouble of heart, and to have their ſpirits ſo cruſhed, as only God can ſupport and uphold them; for, ſo was it with the diſciples, their <hi>hearts</hi> were <hi>troubled</hi> perplexed and confounded. So that whole minded men have need to look about them. 2. The Lord makes uſe of heart-trouble and exerciſe, to ſit his own for the conſolations and proofes of his tender heart which he allowes upon them, whereof otherwiſe they are not capable; for, their <hi>heart-trouble</hi> draws out this ſweet comfortable doctrine. 3. Albeit heart-trouble be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Saints, as a mean of much good; Yet they do ordinarily ſo exceed in it, and debord under it, as it becomes a fault in them; Therefore doth he diſſwade from it, <hi>let not your heart be troubled.</hi> And herein they failed, both through exceſſe, and being immoderate in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48148:150"/>
their ſorrow, and in being troubled at that which might afford joy, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. 4. Albeit Saints do, oft-times, give over themſelves to heartleſſe dejection and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as conceiving they have no other cauſe or allowance; Yet be their caſe what it will, it is not the will of Chriſt they ſhould entertain ſuch a diſpoſition, but that they ſhould ſtrive againſt it; Therefore doth he exhort them to oppoſe this diſtemper, <hi>Let not your heart be troubled.</hi> Albeit nothing could ſeem ſadder to them then the removal of his bodily preſence, yet he counts it their fault that they were ſo addicted to ſenſe, as they could not expect to be comforted another way againſt it; And therefore exhorts them to oppoſe their ſorrow See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

And upon the ſame ground ought Saints to oppoſe all diſcouragements (how juſt cauſe ſoever it ſeem to have) under which they would lye down and reſt, without expecting an iſſue, or that the matter of their diſcouragement may prove a mean leading to an higher end; and which would drive them from Chriſt, and marre his allowed conſolations. And for this end, they would beware of paſſion, which deſires do quarrel with, and be jealous of Chriſt; of ignorance, and miſtaking his minde in trouble; and of carnal expectations, the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof may cruſh them. 5. Whatever be Saints duty, to oppoſe diſcouragement and trouble; Yet it is Chriſt only who is the Phyſitian of troubled ſouls, and who muſt ſpeak the word, and ſet them on work; for, he it is who gives this comfortable counſel and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 6. Chriſt is ſo tender of his grieved and troubled people, that whatever weakneſſe they kithe, yet he will make it his chiefe work to ſee to their encouragement; Therefore, albeit he had his own bitter trouble, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.21. and was, that night and the day following, to grapple with wrath, and hell and death; Yet he forgets all that, and ſpendeth his time in comforting and eaſing them, <hi>Let not your heart be troubled.</hi> 7. Such as take up Chriſt rightly, will not be much diſmayed at what befals him or his; Therefore doth he point out himſelf as God, that they might not ſtumble at his ſuffering, nor their own ſcattering. 8. Chriſt, notwithſtanding his abaſement and ſuffering as man, is true God, the object of ſaving ſaith, equally with the Father: Therefore doth he urge <hi>beleeving in him,</hi> as they did <hi>beleeve in God.</hi> 9. The ſaith of humbled and troubled ſouls can, bottome or faſten on nothing that is inferiour to God; nor can any other thing bear their weight; for, it is a proofe of his deity, that he is the object of faith. 10. Albeit Chriſt do not remove from troubled Saints the afflictions which raiſe their trouble; Yet they have comfort ſufficient, if they beleeve; for, this is their encouragement who had Chriſt himſelfe to comfort them, <hi>beleeve.</hi> 11. It is the will of God, that Chriſts bodily abſence be ſupplyed and made up with faith, which will make an abſent Chriſt preſent to a beleever; for, it is to cure this diſeaſe that this remedy is applyed, <hi>beleeve.</hi> 12. Whatever other ground of conſolation Chriſt allow upon his followers within time; Yet the firſt encouragement muſt begin at beleeving, and faith muſt grip him, and hold him faſt, till other encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpring up in it's hand: for, this is the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that muſt go before all the reſt here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and make way for them. 13. Faith in God and Chriſt is ſo acceptable and well-pleaſing unto Chriſt, that troubled ſouls are commanded and invited to it: ſo that they ſin if they beleeve not: for, ſaith he, <hi>ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God,</hi> (or: <hi>beleeve in God,) beleeve alſo in me.</hi> 14. While he conjoynes himſelfe with the Father, and preſſeth to faith in both, it ſerveth to teach. 1. Faith, in laying hold on Chriſt, muſt aſcend up through the vail of his fleſh and office of Mediatour, and faſten on him as true God, one in eſſence and equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for, ſo doth this exhortation import. 2. Faith in God the Father muſt be joyned with faith in Chriſt, in whom the Father is to be taken up in the matter of reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and through whom we muſt beleeve in God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Therefore it is required that with their <hi>beleeving in God,</hi> they <hi>beleeve alſo in him.</hi> 3. It is a notable encouragement, inviting troubled ſouls to beleeve, when they conſider the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite latitude of the object of faith, as it cloſeth both with the Father and the Son, not ſecluding the Holy Ghoſt; For in the Son they will finde eternal Redemption, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction: In the Father, infinite love, and free grace accepting the Elect in Chriſt: In the Holy Ghoſt, infinite vertue and power applying Chriſts purchaſe: And in both Father and Son, (not ſecluding the Holy Ghoſt) infinite power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and preſerving the Elect, till they come to full fruition. So much alſo may be gathered from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct naming of the Father and Son, as the object of their faith.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe is contained the ſecond Argument of conſolation, which (as Chriſts conſolations are all rich) contains a double encouragement in the boſome of it. For, 1. He preſuppoſeth it as a ground of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſolation, that heaven, to which he went, was his Fathers houſe, and was deſigned not for him alone to aſcend unto, but for many moe through him, (for whom there is roome enough) for their perpetual reſt and abode. 2. He confirmes this ſuppoſition, from his fidelity and good-will to them, aſſuring them he would never delude them with vain hopes. 3. He ſubjoynes the principal conſolation: that his going to heaven was for their good, to prepare a place for them, <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as ſtudy encouragement by ſaith, ought to lift up their hearts to the hope of future glory, that ſo their conſolation may be ſtrong; Therefore is this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the hope of glory, ſubjoyned to the former, of living by faith for the preſent, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. Whatever be the toſſed life of Saints here, which the Lord, in deep wiſdome, carves out for them, that they may indeed be ſtrangers and pilgrims; Yet it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, that there is a ſolid and quiet reſting place prepared for them in heaven; for this cauſe doth he give it the name of a <hi>manſion,</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. 3. There is abundance of roome in heaven, and in Gods love, to receive ſinners: And albeit it hath not ſeemed good to him to ſave all, nor the moſt part; Yet there are many to be ſaved and admitted into that bleſſed reſt: Therefore it is deſigned <hi>Many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</hi>

which is not to be carnally conceived of, as if heaven were divided into ſo many Cel's; Nor yet as pointing at ſeveral degrees in glory; But the expreſſion is to be underſtood in oppoſition to Chriſts aſcending at this time his alone. And by it he would intimate, that there was roome in heaven, not for him alone, but for many through him, in whoſe name he was a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, as is after cleared: So that none need to be deterred from comming to Chriſt, by reaſon of the paucity of the Elect. 4. It may ſweeten the hope of glory unto Saints, when they conſider that heaven is the houſe of God, wherein he will familiarly converſe with his domeſticks; wherein they will get a clear and full fight of him; ſhall enjoy full glory, as being in the Kings Palace; ſhall get a ſecure and quiet habitation, beyond the reach of enemies, enjoying the treaſures which they laid up there before; And, wherein all the children ſhall at laſt be gathered together: Therefore it is here deſcribed to be the <hi>Fathers houſe.</hi> 5. It adds to the conſolation of Saints, that however the glory and riches of heaven might cruſh their hopes that ever ſuch unworthy ones as they ſhould be ſo dignified; Yet Chriſt as their head is Lord and heire thereof, and he will come ſpeed there for their behooſe; Therefore doth he ſo comfortably deſcribe it, <hi>my Fathers houſe.</hi> 6. Chriſt is no falſe Prophet or deceiver of his people; He reveals all that is neceſſary for them to know, nor will he hide any thing that is for their good: for, in this he bids them credit his fidelity and love, <hi>If it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi> 7. Chriſts deed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance will never give his Word the lye, nor will there be anything leſſe found in heaven then he hath promiſed: So much alſo is imported in this here, <hi>If it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi> 8. There is no trial ſo bitter and ſad, but Chriſt can draw precious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations out of it to his own, and bring it about for their good; for, what more ſad to the diſciples, then to be ſeparate from their Maſter? and yet he draws ground of comfort out of it, <hi>I go</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of his voluntarineſſe in dying) <hi>to prepare a place for you.</hi> 9. No man by nature hath any right to heaven, until it be acquired and prepared for him; for, ſo is here imported, that a <hi>place,</hi> muſt be <hi>prepared,</hi> even for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. 10. Albeit in Gods decree heaven was prepared for the Elect from the foundation of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. Yet it is through Chriſt only that they come to get actual right to it: for, <hi>I prepare a place for you,</hi> ſaith he. 11. As Chriſt by his death did purchaſe a right and title to heaven for Saints; So by his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into heaven, he proſecutes and applies that right. For in his aſcenſion he is declared acquit and righteous in our name; He led captive all theſe who might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. As harbingers go before, to prepare roomes for theſe who are to follow after; So he aſcended as a common perſon, to take poſſeſſion in our name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. As the High Prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the moſt holy place, with the names of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on his breaſt, and with the blood of the ſacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. So he hath entered heaven with our names on his heart, to preſent the merit of his blood continually, to poure out his ſpirit to fit us for glory, and by his Interceſſion to promove our going thither. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12. Therefore ſaith he, <hi>I go</hi> (not only to die, <hi>but to my Fathers houſe) to prepare a place for you.</hi> So that his aſcenſion proves the way is patent, is a pledge of our aſcenſion; and aſſures us that the inheritance will be keeped, till we be ripe for it. Which yet is not to be underſtood, as if heaven had not been prepared for any before his aſcenſion, but that without his miret (either as aſcended or to aſcend) none hath acceſſe to heaven; So that he aſcended firſt, in priority of nature, as the cauſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of all his followers, though not firſt in priority of time. 12. Whatever be Chriſts condition, it is ſtill for the beleevers good; and wherever he be, he is about their affairs; for, as he deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when our affairs required it, ſo alſo he aſcended again on our affairs. 13. It is an undoubted pledge that Chriſt, exalted in glory, will not forget his followers on earth, that their affairs was a great part of his errand thither: for, if he <hi>go to prepare a place,</hi> we may be ſure he will not forget his errand.</p>

                  <p>The third argument of conſolation is, that having done his work in heaven in their name, he will return and fetch them to glory and the full fruition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Which is not only to be underſtood of his fetching particular beleevers at death, but chiefly, of his coming at the great day, when he ſhall make one errand of all, and take up all his followers, to perfect them both in ſoul and body. This conſolation is confirmed. 1. From his errand in departing, If he go away on their affairs, he will ſtay no longer then their affairs require; but when he hath done his work, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. 2. (Which is alſo a deſcription of that bleſſed eſtate, to the poſſeſſion whereof he will take them) from his love to their ſociety, and therefore he will have them to be with himſelfe, and where he is. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The ſaith of the ſecond coming of Chriſt ought to uphold the hearts of beleevers, during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for, this another conſolation, <hi>I will come againe, and receive you.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 1 11. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12, 13. 2. It is the great conſolation of beleevers, that their living by faith, ſhall at laſt end in fruition; And albeit this be only beleeved for the preſent, yet it may make all other exerciſes of faith comfortable, that this is one among the reſt, even that their faith, having carried them through many a tempeſt and dark cloud, will at laſt reſolve in ſight and enjoyment; Therefore is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, of his <hi>receiving</hi> them, ſubjoyned to the former of faith and hope, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. as that which will perfect them all, being the day of full redemption, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19, 54, 55. 3. It is ample matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to beleevers, that not only ſhall they be eternally glorified, but that Chriſt doth condeſcend to do all the duties, for perfecting their happineſs, that can be expected by reaſon of his relations; for, as bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groomes uſe to fetch their brides, ſo he will not decline to do that duty to his bride, how naughty ſoever ſhe be, <hi>I will come again, and receive you.</hi> He not only knows ſhe could never come to him otherwiſe, but his great love to her, and his purpoſe to make her glorious, doth endeare her to him, ſo that he will ſtoop to ſuch duties.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48148:151"/>
4. It doth commend the love of Chriſt to beleevers, and augment their comfort, that he is ſo eminently active in promoving their eternal happineſſe, in all the ſteps thereof, and taketh the whole burden of it upon himſelfe, leaving them little or nothing to do; for, as it is he who deſcended for their behoofe, and came to ſeek them when they had no minde of him; ſo it is he who <hi>goeth</hi> up again for them, who <hi>prepareth a place</hi> for them there, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and who after all that, <hi>commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and receiveth them.</hi> It is true, He hath enioyned beleevers their duty, which they muſt not ſleight through preſumptuous leaning on him: Yet not only doth not that merit any thing, but he layeth on a yoke of duty on us, that we may employ him to work all our works in us, and for us, and ſo he will work in us both to will and to do. 5. A right ſtudy of Chriſts errand to heaven, may aſſure us that he is engaged to come again and perfect us, and that he will return when he hath done our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there; for, ſo doth he confirme this conſolation; <hi>If I go and prepare a place for you,</hi> (or, <hi>when I go and ſhall have prepared a place for you,</hi> as the one particle is often put for the other) <hi>I will come again and receive you.</hi> This doth moſt clearly follow, becauſe his love having taken on that employment, will not put it off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, nor will he be unanſwerable to his truſt, nor loſe all the pains he hath taken to purchaſe and prepare a place, by not coming again to perfect his own. 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſt removed his bodily preſence from his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, yet his love to them and their fellowſhip did not ceaſe, nor will he reſt ſatisfied till he and they meet to enjoy his company; for, he who delighted among the Sons of men, before the world was, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. who delighted to converſe with his people in humane ſhape before his Incarnation, and who took pleaſure to ſpend his time buſily among them, while he was with them in the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>Joh</hi> 9.4, 5. Even he is ſo tender in his love, that he hath minde of returning before he go away, and before he want their company, he will yet leave heaven for their ſakes, and <hi>come again</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and receive you unto my ſelfe,</hi> and that for this end, <hi>that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> 7. As Chriſts follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers are in this life called to be conforme to his image, and to partake with him in ſufferings; So his love will have them at laſt advanced to communion in glory with himſelfe, in that meaſure which they, as his members, are capable of: for, this is his purpoſe concerning them, <hi>that where I am, there ye may be alſo,</hi> 8. It makes the hope of heaven ſweet to Saints, when they conſider that there they will meet with, and fully enjoy Chriſt, whom they have ſo often delighted to look upon through a vail, and whoſe company hath oft-times offered them much of heaven upon earth, and in their ſaddeſt lots; and that they ſhall never again be ſeparated from him: Therefore doth he propound this as their ſweet encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, <hi>I will receive you unto my ſelfe, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17.</p>

                  <p>The fourth argument of conſolation (propounded in this verſe) is, that however he was to leave them; yet they knew whether he went, and which was the way thither. For clearing whereof, Conſider, 1. As the place to which he went, was to his Father, and his houſe (as is cleared <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and in the following purpoſe) ſo, by <hi>the way</hi> here, he points out not only the way wherein he was to walk to glory, but the way alſo wherein they were to follow, as the following enlargement of this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation maketh clear. 2. The way to heaven is (ſo to ſay) twofold; Firſt, the way of diſpenſations and lots, wherewith Saints are eſſayed in going through; And thus, as Chriſt went to his Father by ſad ſufferings, ſo beleevers enter into the Kingdome through much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. Secondly, the way of their duty, and the means whereby they may come to God, and walk through theſe difficulties, till they come to him in heaven; And thus, as Chriſt paved a way for himſelfe, ſo is the the way to all others, as we will hear, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Now albeit the firſt of theſe be not to be excluded here; for we are to follow him in that way, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. yet the laſt is chiefly inſiſted on in the explication. 3. As for the diſciples knowing of theſe, (which is contradicted by <hi>Thomas</hi>) his aſſertion imports not only that they had been ſufficiently furniſhed with means to have known, but that they did alſo know them, in part, and in ſome reſpect. So the meaning is, that it might ſufficiently encourage them, that they knew heaven and the Father, to whom he went and they were to follow, and were inſtructed that ſuffering and tribulation was the high way to heaven, both for him and them: And that albeit he withdrew his bodily preſence, yet they knew the way of correſponding with the Father in heaven, and had a ſure way to guide them home. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Beleevers, who do ſeriouſly ſtudy to know heaven, and what the reſting place of pilgrims is, will finde rich conſolation in it; for, this is one branch of the encouragement, <hi>ye know whither I go.</hi> 2. It contributes exceedingly to beleevers encouragement by knowing heaven, to know that Chriſt is gone there, and glorified with his Father for their good; for, this is the particular conſideration, rendring this knowledge of heaven comfortable, <hi>whither I go ye know,</hi> namely, that I ſuccumb not under my ſufferings, but aſcend to heaven to my Father. 3. It contributes much to the comfort of beleevers, and is their peculiar priviledge in their abſence from the Lord, as to know God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo to know the way that leads thither, to be the way indeed, and to be armed againſt all miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the way, being compared with the end of it, to which it oft-times looks ſo unſutable; for, ſo much is held out in this encouragement, as it relates to the way of diſpenſation, wherein Chriſt went to heaven, and beleevers follow him. It is an encouragement, <hi>the way ye know,</hi> and need not miſtake ſad ſufferings, as if they were not leading to a crown, as too many do little beleeve that to looſe, is to gain, and to dye, the way to life. 4. It is not ſufficient for the encouragement of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they have a contemplative knowledge of heaven, and the difficulties that lye in the way to it; unleſſe alſo Chriſts removal out of the world do eſtrange their affections from it, and make them become pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and ſet them on work to know the way and means how they may haſten after him, to come where he is; and in the mean time may keep entercourſe and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with him, and through him with the Father. For, this is the great encouragement, <hi>ye know the way,</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:48148:151"/>
namely, that he is the way to the Father to whom he goeth, as is after cleared. 5. Chriſt hath not left his followers without ſufficient means of information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning heaven and the way to it, and without ſuch a meaſure of knowledge of theſe things, as might be ample matter of encouragement, if they knew how to diſcerne and emprove it; for, he aſſerts, for their comfort, not only in reſpect of means, but as to their actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo, <hi>whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</hi> 6. Chriſt knoweth his people, and what they are, better then they do themſelves, and his verdict of them is to be preferred before their own; for, notwithſtanding their doubts afterward mentioned, he aſſerts, <hi>whither I go ye know, &amp;c.</hi>

His doubt is propounded in this verſe, wherein being raſh, incredulous, and timorous (as was uſual to him. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 16. and 20. 25.) and ſuppoſing that Chriſt would retire ſome whither and leave them, he objects, in name of all the reſt, that they knew not whither he went, and conſequently, could not know the way. This being a contradiction to Chriſts aſſertion, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. The reconciliation thereof is not to be taken from this, that Chriſt only ſpeaks of ſufficient informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given, whereby they might have known; and that <hi>Thomas</hi> objects that, for all this, they did not actually know. For Chriſt afterward aſſerts, that that they actually knew in ſome meaſure. But the true riſe of the difference betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Thomas,</hi> is, 1. Chriſt aſſerts they did know, which holds true, though they did but know confuſedly and in ſome meaſure; <hi>Thomas</hi> finding no ſuch diſtinct knowledge as he deſired, objects, that he knew not at all. 2. Chriſt knew that in this matter his diſciples did know more, then <hi>Thomas</hi> underſtood that he and they did know, and therefore he thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: For they know Chriſt in ſome meaſure, which was in ſubſtance the knowledge of the Father to whom he went, and of the way to him, as is after cleared; Yet he knew not theſe things under the notions and tearmes of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> and therefore objects his ignorance. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The knowledge that Saints attain unto, is very little, in reſpect of what they might have in the uſe of means afforded them; for, in reſpect of meaſure, it is true which <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, and yet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts not Chriſts aſſertion; <hi>we know not.</hi> 2. None will ever ſtudy to know, nor can they rightly know the way to heaven, till firſt they attain to ſome knowledge of heaven it ſelfe, to ſet them on work to enquire after the way; for, upon this, <hi>we know not whither thou goeſt, Thomas</hi> inferreth ſtrongly, <hi>how then can we know the way?</hi> 3. Such as are convinced and humbled under the ſenſe of their ignorance, will not ſtand to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, that they may abaſe themſelves before the Lord; for, ſo doth <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledge it here? 4. Such as are convinced of their own ignorance and infirmities, will thereby become more ſenſible of the weakneſſe of others alſo; for, upon this ground it is that he ſpeaks in all their names, <hi>Lord, we know not.</hi> 5. It is an uſual weakneſſe in beleevers, that their conviction of ſhort coming doth drive them to think they have no good at all; for, in this reſpect <hi>Thomas</hi> his confeſſion comes ſhort, and contradicts Chriſt, in ſaying ſimply, <hi>we know not.</hi> 6. Saints may have true good and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, which he knoweth and alloweth them to be encouraged in, whereof yet they may be ignorant, and will not take with it; for, Chriſt hath told them, <hi>ye know,</hi> ver. 4. and yet ſaith he, <hi>we know not.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, Saints are under tentation and in a feaver, and ſo cannot diſcerne their grace; Sometime, they do ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of grace in its higheſt perfection, that they cannot diſcerne the ſmall beginnings they have; And, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, they know truths in ſubſtance, yet they cannot give a name to what they know, nor underſtand it under the notions and tearmes by which it may be expreſſed, as <hi>Thomas</hi> knew Chriſt, but not diſtinctly under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of the way,</hi> or as he in whom the Father is to be known. This may teach men condeſcendence in their expreſſions to others, and to beware of making their own conceptions of grace and truth's, a rule whereby to judge of all others; but they muſt vary expreſſions and notions, till it be ſeen whither they know the thing it ſelfe or not.</p>

And firſt, (in this verſe) as to the way to that place, he forbears to ſpeak of the way of difficulties he and they were to go through, and clears only the way whereby they might come to heaven through theſe difficulties; to wit, by himſelfe, who as he made a way to himſelfe by his own proper power and authority; ſo he is the way to all others, by whom alone men can come to the Father, as is inferred in the end of the verſe, Unto this is ſubjoyned, by way of amplification, that he is <hi>the truth, and the life;</hi> which as it holds true in many reſpects; That he is truth in his doctrine, the truth of all the types, and the quickner and preſerver of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life in his people; So it here points out, partly, the properties of this way, that he is that true and living way; and partly, the order of walking in, and making uſe of that way, that, firſt, we muſt cloſe with him by faith, as truth, and doing ſo, ſhall finde him to be life in our walking, which is to be perfected, as our prize, at the end of the journey. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is very tender of the acknowledged ignorance of his own, and will take pains to help it; for, here he inſtructeth <hi>Thomas,</hi> who confeſſed his ignorance. 2. However Saints may look upon their infirmities, ignorance, and doubts, as very burdenſome and uſeleſſe; Yet Chriſt can bring much good out of them, to clear and confirme themſelves and others the more; for, Chriſt makes uſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> doubt to clear up this argument of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more fully, for the good of beleevers in all ages. 3. Such as rightly know heaven, and the way and means to wraſtle through unto it, may eaſily digeſt difficulties in the way; for this cauſe it is that Chriſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48148:152"/>
inſiſts no more on the rough path of trouble which leads toward heaven, becauſe the knowledge of heaven, and of the Father there, and of Chriſt as the way thither, is enough to ſwallow it up, and therefore he inſiſts only on that. 4. Man by nature is ſubject to many neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſpiritual miſeries, as being ſubject to go aſtray from the womb, and wanting a path wherein to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs; being ſubject to errour and ſeduction, and wanting light to diſcerne the way of his happineſs, and to guide him in it; and, being dead in ſin legally and ſpiritually, unable to walk in the way, though it were pointed out, and needing no leſſe then eternal life to prevent his eternal miſery; for, all theſe neceſſities are ſuppoſed in this, that he muſt be <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> 5. Chriſt is an al ſufficient remedy for all our wants; He is the way for wanderers, and the path wherein exiles may return toward loſt happineſs; He is the truth, to lead them ſurely, and to point out their path unto them: And he is the quickner of his people; for, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> ſaith he. 6. Chriſt is the way to heaven and to the Father, not only, as it is through him we muſt aſcend up to the knowledge of the Father, or as he points out the way to happineſſe, as a Prophet; But as having, by his merit and ſatisfaction as Prieſt, made a patent doore, whereby ſinners may enter and approach to God; and being their effectual leader in that way, as King; In theſe reſpects he is called <hi>the way.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. So that through him ſinners may come forward. 7. Chriſt alſo is the truth, not only eſſentially in himſelfe, and he from whom all truth is; But more eſpecially, he is the truth as a way to his people, and a true way; Partly, in oppoſition to types and legal ceremonies, which were but ſhadows of this true way, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. Partly, in oppoſition to all deluſions, and vanities of the world, whereby men think to attain happineſs; all which as they draw from Chriſt the true way, ſo they will prove a lye, and not the truth; Partly, in reſpect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereby we are encouraged in our way; All which in him are <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. And partly, in reſpect of his directing us in the way; He is not only a way wherein to walk, but a way that will direct the paſſengers in walking; by the infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of his Word, by the inward direction and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Spirit accompanying the ſame; and, by his gracious providence, hedging them in from many debordings. In all theſe conſiderations, it is Chriſts prerogative, that he is <hi>the way and the truth.</hi> So that Saints may truſt his guiding, and lean on their beloved. 8. It is Chriſts prerogative above all other wayes, that not only he is the truth, but the life alſo; For other wayes cannot furniſh paſſengers, but they may faint and die in them; nor can they lead to a bleſſed reſt: But He is a way who quickneth the dead, when they are brought to it; who furniſheth the paſſengers that walk in him, ſo that they will walk and not be weary, and, who is the author of eternal life, who living by himſelfe, and having merited life by his death, doth conferre eternal life upon walkers, at the end of their journey: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it ſubjoyned, <hi>I am the life.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 2. 9. The right method of making uſe of Chriſt as a way, is firſt to cloſe with him as truth and in his Word of truth, and to walk on beleeving, upon which life will follow, both for preſent and everlaſtingly; for, this <hi>way</hi> is, firſt, the <hi>truth,</hi> and then, <hi>the life.</hi> 10. It is mans chiefe miſery to be ſeparate from God, and his happineſſe, to have acceſſe to him, and enjoy him; for, that is the advantage to be had in this way, even <hi>to come to the Father.</hi> 11. Chriſt is ſo the way to God, as there is no other beſide, unto which a man can lean, but it will deceive him; No ſaving knowledge of God can be had but by him, our reconciliation, vocation, acceſſe to God in prayer, and glorification, muſt be through him and by him; for, <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> 12. Albeit there be no way unto God beſide Chriſt; yea, albeit all things beſide would diſcourage poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: yet ſuch as have fled to Chriſt, may draw near with boldneſſe; for, <hi>albeit no man cometh to the Father but by me,</hi> and all doores beſide be ſhut, yet ſaith he, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe the other ground of conſolation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. is cleared, in anſwer to the ſecond branch of <hi>Thomas</hi> his doubt, concerning the place whither Chriſt went, or the Father to whom he went in that place. Chriſt ſheweth, that this might be known by knowing of him, he being one in eſſence with the Father, the expreſſe image of his perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. and he in whom the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth bodily. Hence Chriſt inferreth, in anſwer to <hi>Thomas</hi> his objection, that from hence forth they know and have ſeen him, not only in reſpect of ſufficient means, but they having known him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 69. they might henceforth know that they knew the Father in him, and had ſeen him formerly, in ſeeing of him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Father is ſavingly known in the Son, and in him only; To know or ſee him with mortal bodily eyes is impoſſible; the knowledge of him in the creation, and in external repreſentations and manifeſtations of his glory, is but imperfect, nor can it ſuffice to ſalvation; To know him in the Law, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, doth but work wrath: But in Chriſt he is held out to be known perfectly, and to ſalvation; for, <hi>if ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo.</hi> And this further clears that to know him, is life eternal. 2. To know Chriſt rightly is the ſumme of all ſaving knowledge, both of God, and of the way to him, and happineſs with him; Therefore doth he ſolve all <hi>Thomas</hi> his doubts, by pointing out himſelfe as both the way, and he in whom the Father may be known. 3. Chriſts followers do need a new gift to diſcern what they have or know ſavingly, and to have it born upon them by him, for their encouragement; Therefore, albeit the diſciples had ſaving knowledge of the Father in ſome meaſure, yet they knew not ſo much, till Chriſt bear it upon them, <hi>ye know him.</hi> 4. It is the duty of beleevers, to emprove the means of encouragement which Chriſt affords them, and it is their fault not to ſee what he diſcovers to them of their enjoyments and condition; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>from hence-forth ye know him;</hi> Not that upon the matter, they knew him
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48148:152"/>
not before, in knowing the Son; But that now after this information and diſcovery, they were bound no more to doubt, but to know that they knew him, for their own encouragement. 5. It is the duty of theſe to whom Chriſt reveals their good condition, not only to emprove it for the future, but to look back to the times, of their miſtake and ignorance, and make uſe of that which they then had, and obſerved not, both for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for their ſhort coming, and for encouragement in him who was better to them then they were aware; Therefore, doth he not only alleadge, <hi>ye know him,</hi> for preſent, but, <hi>have ſeen him,</hi> for the time paſt, that they might obſerve and emprove that.</p>

                  <p>From this to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. this branch of the conſolation, of knowing the Father in the Sonne, is further inſiſted on by occaſion of a new propoſition of <hi>Philip,</hi> another diſciple. And by this means alſo he clears up that argument of conſolation inſinuate, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. that he was God, one, and equal with the Father. This verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Philips</hi> propoſition; Wherein, he expreſſeth a great deſire to have the Father ſhewed unto them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing great ſatisfaction to himſelfe and the reſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: But he failes, in that he is not ſatisfied with the right way of ſeeing the Father; but, declining to be led ſo far about to know the Father, as he conceived the ſeeing of him in Chriſt to be, he deſires, for their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, an immediate and clear ſight of the Father, his glory and majeſty. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The doctrine of Chriſt is not taken off his hand, even by diſciples, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with much difficultie; for, after <hi>Thomas</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>Philip</hi> ſtarts a new difficultie, when Chriſt is clearing them moſt ſweetly. 2. It is the duty of diſciples who are convinced of their ignorance, not to reſt in ſuch a condition, but to labour after knowledge; for, <hi>Philip</hi> not knowing the Father as he deſired, would have him <hi>ſhewed to them,</hi> and this is commendable in him. 3. Such as would have ſaving knowledge of God and divine myſteries, muſt expect and ſeek it only from Chriſt; for, this is commendable alſo, that he takes this courſe, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. 4. Such as expect to be taught by Chriſt, muſt employ him by prayer, with much humility and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhew us the Father.</hi> 5. It is not ſufficient we deſire after knowledge of ſpiritual things, unleſſe our deſires be chiefly carried after the beſt things, and particularly, to know God himſelfe, <hi>Lord, ſhew us the Father,</hi> ſaith he. 6. The ſight and knowledge of God is full of ſatisfaction and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beleevers will reſt content therewith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be their caſe beſide; <hi>ſhew us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Father and it ſufficeth us.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. 7. Saints, even in their beſt and ſpiritual deſires, are ſubject to infirmities, and ready to be unſatisfied with Chriſts way and manner of ſatisfying them; for, <hi>Philip</hi> not being ſatisfied with what Chriſt ſaid, of knowing the Father in him, would know him in a way of his own, and have a nearer cut of it, as he thought, <hi>Lord, ſhew us the Father.</hi> 8. The way of ſeeing and knowing God by faith, as he is revealed in his Son, is a way not ſatisfactory to a carnal heart; and beleevers themſelves have a jealouſie of it, in ſo far as they are carnal; for, this is the ſight of God which <hi>Philip</hi> declineth, and would have another; before it <hi>ſuffice him.</hi> 9. When we are unſatisfied with Chriſts way, and would have a way of our own, we will finde, upon trial, that the way we would be at, is either impoſſible or unſit, or cometh far ſhort of what we enjoy; for, whereas he deſireth Chriſt to <hi>ſhew them the Father,</hi> if he deſire an immediate ſight of him, that is impoſſible, and would conſume mortal men; and if he mean only ſuch a ſight as <hi>Moſes</hi> and others got, it cometh far ſhort of what they had already.</p>

                     </gap>ity with the Father. It may be taken up in three branches; whereof the firſt (in this verſe) is a reprehenſion of <hi>Philips</hi> ignorance, and a complaint that, notwithſtanding his long converſe with them, yet, he knew him ſo ill, as not to ſee the Father in ſeeing of him, but taking no notice of that, did ſtill call for a ſight of the Father. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Even Chriſts diſciples may, for a long time, be but ill ſcholars and ſlow of conception; As here Chriſt findes them. 2. Ignorance in diſciples is rebuke worthy, and Chriſt will not ſpare it in them; As here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. Chriſt takes notice of the means of knowledge his people enjoy, and the continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with them, that he may aggravate their continued in ignorance; for, <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me?</hi> 4. Chriſt may be very long with his people, and they be ſtudying to know him, and yet not know him fully; for, <hi>haſt thou not known me, Philip?</hi> Not that he was ſimply ignorant of Chriſt, but that he knew him not ſo, as to know the Father in him. 5. Chriſt doth reprove the ignorance of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with much tenderneſſe, and ſo as may witneſſe his affection to them and their welfare; Therefore, doth he propound the challenge by way of regrate, <hi>Haſt thou not known me?</hi> 6. As the Father can only be ſavingly known in Chriſt; So none do know Chriſt rightly, and as they ought, unleſſe they know the Father in him, who is the expreſſe image of his perſon, and he in whom the fulneſſe of the undivided eſſence of the Godhead dwells bodily; for, <hi>Philip hath not known</hi> Chriſt aright, ſince he ſaith, <hi>ſhew us the Father,</hi> and that becauſe, <hi>he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> So that if he had known him as he ought, he had not been ignorant of the Father. 7. The knowledge of God which is to be had in Chriſt, is a moſt clear and diſtinct knowledge; for, it is <hi>a ſight, he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> 8. The excellency and preciouſneſſe of things deſired by Saints, will not bear weight before God, if they be not put up in a right way, and if the deſire be joyned with inadvertency and not emproving of means received; for, albeit, <hi>ſhew us the Father,</hi> be a commendable deſire,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48148:153"/>
Yet in ſo far, as he propounds it in theſe tearmes, to know him without the Son, and as if they had not ſeen him already in the Son, Chriſt rejects it. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father, and how ſayeſt thou then, ſhew us the Father?</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond branch of Chriſts anſwer contains an information of the ground of this aſſertion, that they who know him, know the Father; Namely, that he is one in eſſence with the Father. This he preſſeth upon <hi>Philips</hi> conſcience, if he would not aſſent to it by faith; and confirmeth it from his Word, which is the Fathers with him, and from his works, which were wrought not only by him, but by the Father with and in him, theſe being external works, which are common to the whole Trinity, by reaſon of the unity of eſſence, though they be diſtinct perſons. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt, when he reproves his people, doth minde their good, and is willing to informe them, and direct them how to amend; Therefore, doth he ſubjoyne an information to his reproofe, clearing the ground of their knowing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him. And by this he teacheth all Miniſters to joyne doctrine with reproofe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. 2. The true ground of our knowing the Father in the Son, is his unity in eſſence with the Father, ſo that though their perſonal properties be diſtinct, yet the eſſence is the ſame in both, and the one is in the other; for, by this he cleareth his former doctrine, <hi>I am in the Father and the Father in me.</hi> 3. It is faith only, and not our ſenſe or corrupt reaſon, that muſt be employed to take up the myſteries of Religion, and particularly, that Chriſt is God coeſſential with the Father; for, it is faith that is put to it, in this matter, <hi>beleeveſt thou not that I am in the Father,</hi> &amp;c. 4. It is our duty to put our hearts to it, to ſee what they beleeve in the myſteries of God; that ſo we may not take the naked aſſent of the minde for faith, and may be aſhamed to harbour that ſecret unbelief in our hearts, which we dare not avow nor own; Therefore, doth Chriſt ſo put him to it, <hi>Beleeveſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</hi> to ſhame him from thinking otherwiſe. 5. The Word, preached by Chriſt, and tranſmitted to us in Scripture, is the very Word of God, the Father and the Son; for, <hi>the words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelfe,</hi> not only not of his own head, as he was an Ambaſſadour, but not of himſelfe without the Father, as is further cleared, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. So that the Word was his and the Fathers who is in him. 6. Chriſts works, both miraculous, and theſe wrought in beleevers, being done by his own power, do prove him to be true God, one in eſſence with the Father, and the Fathers alſo with him, by reaſon of that unity; for, <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me</hi> (being the ſame in eſſence) <hi>he doth the works,</hi> to wit, with the Son. 7. It is our duty to make uſe of Chriſts Word and works, to confirme our faith in him, as true God one with the Father; for, theſe are not only arguments proving the point, but ſerving to excite <hi>Philip</hi> and the reſt, ſo to ſtudy them, as to finde proofes of a deity in them. 8. They who would profit by Chriſts Word and works in the knowledge of him, ſhould firſt begin and bottome themſelves on his Word, and finde him God there, and then look out to his works, for further confirmation; Therefore, doth he firſt urge the argument of his Word, and then ſubjoynes that of his works.</p>

                  <p>The third branch of Chriſts anſwer contains an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all the diſciples, that they would beleeve this truth of his unity in eſſence with the Father. Which he preſſeth and confirmeth from three reaſons; whereof the firſt (in this verſe) is the ſame in ſubſtance with that <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that he who is the truth ſpeaks it, and hath confirmed it by his works. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The deity of Chriſt, and his unity in eſſence with the Father, is the main article of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be ſtudied and beleeved; Therefore doth he preſſe it, <hi>Beleeve that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> 2. This point of ſaving truth ought to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and diſtinctly inculcate, and ſtudied and learned; otherwiſe our conſolation ariſing from the knowledge of our Mediatour, will not be ſo ſolide, and ſo full, as is allowed; Therefore, notwithſtanding any imperfect knowledge they had of him, and what he had preſſed on <hi>Philip,</hi> he doth again urge that they beleeve this, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I am in the Father,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Chriſt doth ſo take care of one of his followers, whoſe infirmities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible, as he will not forget others, who may be in the like need; for, as he preſſed <hi>Philip,</hi> ver. 10. ſo he preſſeth here all the reſt to beleeve, whom he knew to be ignorant as well as <hi>Philip,</hi> though they had not expreſſed it. <hi>Beleeve ye,</hi> ſaith he, to all of them, in the plural number. 4. The knowledge of Chriſt to be true God, under the vail of his manhood, and ſtate of humiliation, is as difficult as it is neceſſary; and a ſtudy wherein beleevers will finde much matter of humiliation for their ſhort coming; for, ſo much alſo doth this inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, teach us. 5. Chriſt takes pleaſure in the ſoul-proſperity of his ſervants, and that for this end, they ſtudy him well, who is their fountain and ſtore-houſe, and, do cloſe with him by faith as true God; Therefore, doth he exhort and intreat them to <hi>beleeve.</hi> 6. Chriſt is a witneſſe who will not lye; And as it is only on his teſtimony we muſt faſten in matters of faith; So his teſtimony is worthy of all credite and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation by faith in our hearts; for, the exhortation is a reaſon to it ſelfe, <hi>beleeve me,</hi> ſaith he, ſince I have ſaid it. 7. Chriſt, by his condeſcending, to adde works to the teſtimony of his Word, for confirmation of our faith, and that albeit he be God who cannot lye, doth teach his people, not to try men by their words, but their power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19. And to examine all the fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of men, by their fruits; for, this other branch of the argument, taken from his <hi>works,</hi> is added, not becauſe his Word needs ſuch a witneſſe in it ſelfe; but, in part, to teach us caution in the like caſe. 8. Chriſts
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48148:153"/>
works, joyned with his Word, do ſo clearly point him out, that they may extort an acknowledgement of his God-head from men, and will exceedingly heighten the ſin of them who will not truſt in him as God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, <hi>or elſe beleeve me for the very works ſake.</hi> Whereby he doth not allow them not to beleeve himſelf ſpeaking in his Word, nor yet approves of that faith as ſaving, which is begotten by his works, without the Word; But declareth, that his works were ſo clear proofes of a deity, as none without impudence could deny it, nor without great ſin misbeleeve a truth ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon confirming this truth, and preſſing the exhortation, (which alſo is an argument of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation againſt his removal) is contained in a promiſe that beleevers in him ſhall do the works that he did, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For clearing of this purpoſe, and the ſcope thereof, Conſider, 1. The <hi>works</hi> of Chriſt, which here he paralels with theſe to be done by beleevers, are not his works of Redemption, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, nor his works of creation and providence, as God, which are incommunicable with any but his miraculous works, and works wrought on the hearts of men by giving ſucceſſe to his miniſtry. 2. As for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers who are to do theſe, and greater works; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid, in a ſound ſenſe, of every beleevers doing great things, and overcoming the world, through faith in him; Yet the paralel holds clearer to reſtrict it to the Apoſtles and others in the primitive times, who were endued with extraordinary power, and ſent abroad to preach the Goſpel. 3. As for the paralel it ſelfe, that it is promiſed they ſhall <hi>do theſe, and greater then theſe,</hi> and that albeit Chriſt did raiſe the dead, open the eyes of the blind, &amp;c. and cure every diſeaſe; It may be thus cleared, partly, they were greater in reſpect of number; they working many miracles for number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he did; and many for kinde, which he did not, as ſpeaking with new tongues, and the like. See <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.17, 18. and elſewhere; partly, albeit his miracles in themſelves were as great as any of theirs; yet in the way and manner of them, the power did ſhine more conſpicuouſly then in ſome of his. For he did cure men by his Word, and by the touch of his garment, but they did cure many by their ſhaddow paſſing by, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.15. and by napkins carried from them, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.12. And partly, and chiefly, this is to be underſtood of the effects of theſe their miraculous works, and of their miniſtry which theſe works did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company. For Chriſt was the Miniſter of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion only; and by his doctrine and miracles did prevail but with few of them, as himſelfe often complaineth: But the Apoſtles did bring in thouſands by one Sermon at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by their doctrine and miracles did bring down Idols, and ſet up the Kingdome of Chriſt through the world. 4. Whereas Chriſt by his works proveth himſelfe equal with the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and yet promiſeth they ſhall do greater things; We ſhould be far from conceiving that this doth any thing weaken the argument whereby he proveth his deity, far leſſe doth it exalt them to aſpire to any equality with him; for, whatever difference there be betwixt the works wrought by him and them; yet herein is the infinite difference betwixt him and them, that he wrought them by his own power as God, but all they did was by faith in him, who put forth his power to do the works; and accordingly, they did them in his name. So that albeit the doing of theſe works tended to their encouragement, yet the glory thereof redounded only to him. 5. This reaſon why they ſhall do greater works, <hi>becauſe I go to my Father,</hi> doth not inferre there ſhould be any addition to his power then, as God, but that at that time his Godhead (which in the dayes of his fleſh, was hid under the vail of a ſervants ſhape) ſhould more gloriouſly manifeſt it ſelfe. 6. This encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their doing greater works, tends not only to prove him exalted as Mediatour after his ſufferings, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. but alſo to prove that aſſertion, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that he is one with the Father. Becauſe it is an evidence of his abſolute and divine power, that he can conferre this dignity upon others (not as the Apoſtles did miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by laying on of hands, but) through faith in his name. And withall, it is he who doth theſe works by them, as is after cleared, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. We have need to be often excited, to conſider ſeriouſly the weight and gravity of that which Chriſt ſpeaketh; Therefore is ſo frequent uſe made of this aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> 2. Chriſt will bring that unto Saints, out of their worſt and ſaddeſt conditions, which they could neither apprehend nor beleeve, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had ſaid it; Therefore, doth this promiſe, of the great things, for which his removal maketh way, need to be confirmed with a <hi>verily, verily,</hi> that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might give credit unto it. 3. As it is by faith in Chriſt only, that Saints are inabled to do great things, (and therefore the promiſe is made to him, <hi>that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on me;</hi> It will make <hi>Peter</hi> walk on the Sea, and only unbelief will make him ſink) So the want of Chriſts bodily preſence needs be no hinderance to faith, to cloſe with him, and draw vertue out of him, for enabling to do greateſt things: for, the promiſe is made to him, <hi>that beleeveth on me,</hi> that he ſhall <hi>do the works that I do, and greater then theſe,</hi> after he is aſcended. 4. Albeit Chriſt only, of all the Sons of men, was true God and man in one perſon; Yet the power and vertue of his God-head is not aſtricted to his own perſon, but is communicable in the effects thereof to his members; So that he will do that in them and by them, which only God can do; and they ſhall not want divine power, for carrying them through in what they have to do: for, <hi>He that beleeveth on me, the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo,</hi> &amp;c. 5. Chriſt can, and oft-times doth work that by weak and contemptible means, which he doth not by ſtronger and more probable cauſes; And he did more in the world by his weak Servants, then he was pleaſed to do himſelfe: for, albeit beleevers be but weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet <hi>greater works ſhall he do</hi> (ſaith he, of every
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48148:154"/>
one here intended) <hi>then theſe</hi> done by himſelfe, who is God over all. 6. Mens lawful and ſpiritual employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Chriſts preſence with them therein, are notable encouragements to beleevers during Chriſts abſence; for, their work and great ſucceſſe in it, is one great encouragement to the diſciples here. And as Chriſt alloweth encouragement upon none who are not about their employment; So it is a great comfort, that the ſaddeſt of conditions afford matter of comfortable employment about them, and that work may keep Saints, in their pilgrimage, from thinking too much long. 7. Chriſt is a wiſe diſpenſer of his allowances, who, oft-times, reſerveth greateſt manifeſtations of himſelfe for ſaddeſt times, wherein as they are leaſt expected, ſo they are moſt needed: Therefore is this more ample manifeſtation reſerved for that ſad time, wherein the diſciples were ſaddened with his departure, and might be ready to think that all that power whereby he wrought, was quite removed with his own bodily preſence. 8. Chriſts exaltation hath neither diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power, nor his tender care of his own; But, on the contrary, he doth make his exaltation, his unity as God, and acceptance as Mediatour, with the Father, conſpicuous in the world, by his liberality and bounty toward them; for, this is the reaſon why beleevers ſhall do greater works, <hi>becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.</p>

                  <p>The third reaſon confirming this truth, and preſſing the exhortation, (which alſo is not only another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſolation againſt his removal, but doth further clear the former promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. by ſhewing the way how faith employeth Chriſt for doing theſe great things) is contained in a promiſe, that he will do for them whatſoever they ask in his name; which he twice inculcates, for further confirmation, and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the promiſe from his end in it, which is, that the Father may be glorified in and through him, in what he doth in anſwer to their prayer. For further clearing of the purpoſe. 1. This general, <hi>whatſoever ye ask,</hi> &amp;c. doth not open a doore to vent all our deſires to God, be what they will, in hope of audience, for we muſt ask accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will. But the meaning is, that what things are agreeable to his will, and fit for them to receive in their ſtation, and for advancing his glory and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein, they ſhall be done for them, being ſought in faith, were they never ſo difficult, never ſo many for number, and never ſo frequently needed. And it is compriſed in this general, that it may take in, not only that particular, of power to do theſe great works, but all other things alſo, which beleevers may need. 2. This promiſe contains not only a proofe of his Mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and his ſucceſſe therein, in obtaining what is ſought in his name; and a proofe of his love to them in his abſence, by giving them occaſion to beleeve their own eyes in his anſwers: But a proofe of his Godhead alſo; partly, in that none can be Mediatour betwixt God and man, but he who is true God as well as man; and partly, becauſe he promiſeth to be, not only a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour to procure, but, a God to act and work theſe things, and that hereby God ſhall be glorified in him, as working in and with him, by reaſon of the unity of eſſence. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. As they who are ſenſible of Chriſts bodily abſence in heaven, will ſend many Meſſengers of prayer thither where he is gone; So prayer is a ſpecial mean whereby we may know much of Chriſts deity, and of his love in his abſence: for, here he recommends <hi>asking</hi> as that which they will be put unto, and that whereby they may know what he is. So that it is no wonder, that theſe who neglect prayer, do fall in many miſtakes of Chriſt. 2. True faith and prayer are inſeparable companions; as being begotten together, ſo that faith begins its life in crying to God; and, as growing up together, mutually ſtreightening and ſetting one another on work, till at laſt they end together, faith reſolving in ſight, and prayer in unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted praiſe: Therefore are they conjoyned here, to <hi>beleeve on him,</hi> and to <hi>ask in his name.</hi> 3. True prayer is conjoyned with, and floweth from, a ſenſe of indigency, ſetting the ſupplicant on work to his duty, with earneſtneſſe and humility as a needy beggar; for, ſo much doth the word, rendred to <hi>ask,</hi> import in the Original. And where this is not in ſome meaſure, men do but what they can to work God in prayer. 4. Prayer muſt be offered up to God, in the name of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Chriſt; It is through him we muſt go to God, and our encouragement in pleading, and our hope of acceptance, muſt be grounded on his merit and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and on the Fathers love to him, and to ſinners in him; for, this is the deſcription of true prayer, <hi>what ye ask in my Name.</hi> 5. The Lord alloweth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth frequency, and multiplicity of employments, to be put upon him by prayer; And let us put him to it never ſo often, and for never ſo many things, he will never weary of it, but rather will ſuſpend us in what we ask, becauſe we ask not enough: for, ſo much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this general, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask,</hi> even all that we would have Chriſt doing for us, as is after cleared. 6. It is the will of Chriſt, that ſupplicants, who come to the Father through him, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the difficulty, or ſeeming impoſſibility, of what they need and ask according to his will; But that they expect to obtain that by prayer, which they cannot effectuate any other way: for, ſo much alſo is imported in this, <hi>whatſoever</hi> (how difficult ſoever it be) <hi>ye ſhall ask.</hi> 7. As the anſwer of what we ask in Chriſts name, is moſt certain; So it is Chriſt who is the doer thereof, and who delighteth to manifeſt his Godhead much, in diſpatching the affaires of his people; for, ſaith he, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name, that will I do.</hi> 8. Chriſts end, in anſwering the deſires of his people, is, the ſetting forth of his own and his Fathers glory, which as it may encourage us to expect he will do that which will thus glorifie his Father and him; So it ſhould teach us to glorifie him, in obſerving his power and goodwill in anſwering, and to emprove what we receive, to his glory; for, ſaith he, <hi>That will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> 9. As Chriſt is glorified in his doing for his people, ſo is the Father glorified in him, as being true in his teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48148:154"/>
him, and as being in him working theſe things; for, <hi>the Father is glorified in the Son.</hi> 10. Albeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have many jealouſies concerning the anſwer of their prayers; yet they are all without ground; and it is moſt certain their deſires will be granted; Therefore doth he again repeat the promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. intimating that they need ſuch confirmations, and that this is a word he will not recal. 11. It is not enough to be ſure of the anſwer of our prayers, or that we do receive them, unleſſe we ſee much of Chriſts heart and activity therein; for this cauſe it is again repeated, <hi>I will do it.</hi>

                     <hi>Followeth the firſt Argument of conſolation againſt their heart-trouble, contained in a promiſe of ſending the comforter, even the holy Spirit, unto them; And becauſe of the riches thereof, and becauſe the other conſolations are emproven by receiving of the Spirit, therefore this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is largely inſiſted on,</hi> to ver. 27 <hi>in this order.</hi> 1 <hi>He preſſeth upon them their duty toward him in his abſence, eſpecially, that they may attain this promiſed comforter,</hi> ver. 15. 2. <hi>He ſubjoyns the promiſe of the comforter,</hi> ver. 16, 17. 3. <hi>He inſiſts upon ſeveral benefits which they ſhall reap by enjoying of this comforter,</hi> verſe 18.—26.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe he enjoyns them their duty in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; that they ſhould love him, and evidence the ſame by obſervation of his commandments. And by this direction, partly, he corrects their fond way of expreſſing love to him, by doating on his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſorrowing immoderatly for his abſence; Partly, he preſcribes a remedy and antidote againſt their heart-trouble, by diverſion or revulſion, in turning the ſtream of their affection, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed this heart-trouble, into the channel of diligence about duty; and partly, he ſets them on the right way of attaining the promiſed comforter, as the connexion with the following verſe imports, <hi>keep my commandments, And I will pray, &amp;c. Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the character of every true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, that they do love their Lord and Maſter; for, ſo is ſuppoſed here as their duty and practice, <hi>ye love me.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.21. 2. The love of diſciples to Chriſt muſt not, and will not be obſtructed by his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard diſpenſations, nor quenched by his abſence; for, though he be now to remove, yet he ſuppoſeth they have, and will have love to him, <hi>ye love me.</hi> 3. Love to Chriſt muſt not be ſaid only, nor will it lye lurking in the heart, but muſt and will break forth in proofes and evidences of it ſelfe; Therefore, Chriſt requires a proofe of their love, <hi>if ye love me, keep my commandments.</hi> 4. True love to Chriſt may ſometime be ſo overpowred with unbelief, haſt, and our impetuous paſſions, as the proofes thereof, how vehement ſoever, yet, are not ſo right as becomes; Therefore is there need of direction how to evidence their love, in oppoſition to the proofes they gave thereof. 5. Obedience to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is of the true touch-ſtone and evidence of love to Chriſt; And in Chriſts abſence they do not evidence ſuch pure love to him, who are ready to lye down and die through diſcouragement, as they who are moſt at their work, and are moſt buſie about his errands; for, by this doth he try them, and this doth he recommend as an evidence of love in his abſence, <hi>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</hi> 6. True obedience muſt flow not only from the fear of God, but from love and ſenſe of our obligation to Chriſt alſo, and diſciples will look on commandments, and give them obedience, as very ſweet for his ſake; Therefore alſo doth he preſuppoſe <hi>love to him,</hi> as a principle of obedience, and recommends the commandments to be obſerved as his, <hi>keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 7. To be much about duty and ſervice, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſts commandments, is a very preſent diverſion and cure of heart-trouble, which is but fed with idle diſcouragement; And it is the way to a more perfect cure, which cannot be expected by lazie drowpers; for, this direction is both a cure in it ſelfe, and fits them for obtaining the following promiſe, as hath been ſaid in opening up of the words.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes is contained the argument of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it ſelfe, and the promiſe of the Spirit, which is ſubjoyned to the former direction, as a fruit following thereupon, and as an encouragement againſt the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they would meet with in doing their duty; Not that formerly they were wholly deſtitute of the Spirit, but that now they were to receive him in more ample meaſure. The gift promiſed is here deſcribed. 1. From the way of his coming, Chriſt interceeds with the Father, and he ſends him, not ſecluding the Sonne as God, from whom he proceeds and who alſo ſends him from the Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.26. and 16.7. though here he ſpeak only of himſelf as Mediatour. 2. From his titles, taken from his office and work in beleevers; He is a <hi>Comforter,</hi> and <hi>Advocate,</hi> as the Word alſo is rendred, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. and <hi>another Comforter,</hi> as being a diſtinct perſon from the Father and the Sonne, and working comfort in beleevers in a diſtinct way of applying Chriſts purchaſe to them, and ſealing and bearing witneſſe to it in them, he is likewiſe called <hi>the Spirit of truth,</hi> ver. 17. not only in his own eſſence, but in his operation in beleevers, leading them in all truth. Of which afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.13. 3. From his permanency in beleevers, that he will abide with them for ever, and not depart from them, as Chriſt took away his bodily preſence. 4. From the ſingularity of the gift, as being peculiar to beleevers; For the world cannot receive him becauſe of their ignorance; but they having knowledge of him by his begun preſence, their knowledge and communion ſhall be continued and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. By <hi>the word</hi> here, we are not to underſtand only theſe who are eminent in it, or all without the Church; but all who are of the world, in the ſtate of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48148:155"/>
nature, and addicted to the world and under the power of ſin. And while it is ſaid, <hi>the world cannot receive him,</hi> it holds true of reprobates, whom the Lord hath determined to leave in their woful natural condition, that they can never receive the Spirit of regeneration, nor any comfort flowing therefrom, though they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the common, and even extraordinary, gifts of the Spirit. But if we take <hi>the world</hi> more generally, for men in the ſtate of nature (whereof there may be many elect) the meaning is, that they <hi>cannot receive him,</hi> to wit, ſo long as they continue in that ſtate, and till he tranſlate them. Far leſſe are they capable of ſuch a gift in the increaſe thereof, (which is the thing here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed) more then a dead man is capable of nouriſhment. Though in this place he ſeemeth chiefly to point at the reprobate world, who are of the world, and continue ſo. And albeit the promiſe be made particularly to the Apoſtles, and they had the accompliſhment thereof in a ſingular way; yet the encouragement is to be extended to all beleevers, who finde the Spirit a <hi>Comforter</hi> and <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> to them, though not in ſo extraordinary a manner.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. None can expect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of Chriſt by his Spirit, unleſſe they teſtifie their love to him by obedience; And they who do ſo, have his Word, whereupon they may expect needful comfort; for, upon theſe tearms mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will pray the Father, and he will give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> 2. Chriſts bodily preſence was a great comfort to his diſciples, and during the time of his converſe with them, he was ſo tender of them, ſo kinde to them, and took ſuch burthen and care of them, as did much refreſh and eaſe them; for, while he promiſeth <hi>another Comforter,</hi> in ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad of himſelf, it intimates he had been a <hi>Comforter</hi> himſelfe. Hence it was that he would not let them faſt, nor did put hard burthens on them, but let them ſee his glory, preached ſweetly unto them, and went betwixt them and all difficulties, 3. Chriſt doth not remove one Comforter from his people, but he will give another, and make up their loſſe; for, when he is to remove, <hi>another Comforter</hi> is promiſed. 4. As diſciples can have no true comfort but by the Spirit, ſo a large meaſure thereof is allowed them, to ſupply the want of Chriſts bodily preſence; for, he is the <hi>Comforter</hi> during Chriſts abſence, namely, in a larger meaſure then they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 5. Whatever be the operations of the Spirit of Chriſt in beleevers; Yet the ſcope of all his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his exerciſing of them, tend in end to comfort them; Therefore gets he this ſtile, of a <hi>Comforter,</hi> in relation to them. 6. The Spirit of God in beleevers is not only a Comforter, to plead, apply, and bear in the conſolations of God, purchaſed by Chriſt, upon their hearts; But is their Advocate alſo, who pleads their cauſe with God, by furniſhing them with prayers and groans that cannot be uttered, to be put up in the hands of Chriſt, the Mediatour of interceſſion: for, the <hi>Comforter,</hi> is the <hi>Advocate</hi> alſo, as the Word imports. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. 7. The Holy Ghoſt is a perſon in the Godhead diſtinct from, and equal with the Father and the Sonne; for, he is <hi>another Comforter,</hi> diſtinct from the Son, and equal with him, in that he is <hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> alſo, as he is: And he is <hi>given by the Father,</hi> and ſo diſtinct from him; and his <hi>giving,</hi> or ſending, him is no note of ſuperiority, nor <hi>being ſent,</hi> of inferiority, for equals may ſend one another; but it only points at the order of the perſons in their ſubſtance and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And ſo, as the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, ſo he is given by both, in their order of ſubſiſtence, to beleevers. 8. In expecting this great promiſe of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> beleevers ought not to look to their own merits, or the worth of their obedience, which can promiſe no ſuch thing; But their eye muſt be fixed on the free grace of God, who doth freely gift his Spirit to his own: for, albeit a duty be required of them who expect this mercy, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Yet, ſaith he, <hi>the Father ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> 9. As it is Chriſts work in heaven to intercede for his people, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their comforts, notwithſtanding the ſinfulneſſe and ſhort coming of their prayers, and the difficulty of things deſired; And therefore he ſhould be acknowledged in all the comforts they receive, as minding them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: So in particular, the Spirit, who is the great Comforter, is conferred upon them through his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the channel through which free grace runs out toward ſinners, For, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> 10. Albeit many, yea, all the outward comforts of beleevers are moveable; yet the holy Spirit is given unto them without reverſion, and is an abiding conſolation and Comforter, for all times, and all caſes; for, he is given, <hi>that he may abide,</hi> (and abide a <hi>Comforter,</hi> anſwerable to his name) <hi>with you for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Spirit of God is true, yea, truth it ſelf in his eſſence and perſon, ſo is he true in his office of Comforter to beleevers; all his conſolations being ſolid and real, and free of deluſion; for, the <hi>Comforter</hi> is <hi>the Spirit of truth.</hi> 2. As the holy Ghoſt is the revealer of truth; So he comforts by the Word of truth, and by leading beleevers to relye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; for, thus is he <hi>the Spirit of truth,</hi> leading men to the Word of truth, and making it effectual for their comfort. So that without the Word there is no enjoying of the Spirit of Chriſt. 3. As the gift of the Spirit, in his ſpecial diſpenſations, is very rare; So it will adde to the commendation of this encouragement, if we ſtudy the ſingularity thereof, and what a difference the Lord puts therein betwixt his own and the world; Therefore is he commended from this, <hi>the world cannot receive him, but ye know him.</hi> So alſo are other mercies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and to be ſtudied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 8. 4. The world and natural men are great ſtrangers to the Spirit of Chriſt; they are not capable of ſuch a gift, nor do they deſire after it, but beleevers live on hid Manna to them; for, he is <hi>the Spirit of truth, whom the Word cannot receive.</hi> 5. As the Spirit of Chriſt, where he is received, bringeth light and knowledge along with him; So the reaſon why he is ſo little deſired, is, becauſe he is ſo little known, and what ſweetneſſe is to be had in enjoying of him. And ſo it rubs no indignity on him, that the world deſireth him not; for, that which is ſubjoyned, <hi>becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> is both a cauſe of their not receiving him, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and a proofe that they have not received him, ſince they do not know him, as on the contrary, in the end of the verſe, diſciples <hi>know him, becauſe he dwells with them;</hi> Their knowledge is a fruit of inhabitation. As for the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48148:155"/>
two words here uſed, of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> and <hi>knowing,</hi> we need not be curious to put a difference betwixt them, as if the firſt pointed out, that as they ſaw him not with bodily eyes, ſo they took as little notice of his viſible operations; and the ſecond charged upon them, that they did as little underſtand with their heart, as they did ſee with their eyes: Or, that the firſt points out their ſimple ignorance and not ſeeing of him, and the ſecond, that ſince they have not ſeen him, they do not eſteeme of nor deſire him, ſince knowledge muſt draw out affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It ſufficeth to know, that by theſe expreſſions is pointed out their utter ignorance of him, and Chriſt prevents all curious criticiſmes, by comprehending the contrary caſe of diſciples in this one for both, <hi>ye know him.</hi> 6. A cauſe of mens ignorance, and not deſiring of the Spirit, is, that they are of the world, and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a conformity with theſe things they luſt after, as they become brutiſh, and can neither diſcern nor deſire what is their true excellency and happineſſe; for, they are <hi>the world,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot receive him,</hi> not <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>know</hi> him. 7. The brutiſh ſtupidity of the world, will not hinder Gods kindneſſe to his own, in communicating and revealing his Spirit unto them; Nor ſhould it hinder diſciples to ſtudy to know and deſire after him; for, ſaith he, <hi>But ye know him,</hi> ye both know and deſire after him. 8. No light will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Spirit but himſelf; nor can any know him, but they who enjoy him: for, <hi>ye know him, for he dwelleth with you.</hi> 9 The Spirits preſence in beleevers is very intimate and familiar; for, he not only <hi>dwelleth with you,</hi> to be aſſiſting in what they need, but <hi>ſhall be in you,</hi> as in his Temple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. and 6.19. 10. Where the Spirit is given, he will not change his dwelling; but beleevers enjoyment of him ſhall be bleſſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and encreaſing enjoyment; for, as <hi>he dwelleth with you,</hi> ſo he <hi>ſhall be in you,</hi> in a more large meaſure, and conſtant abode.</p>

                  <p>The firſt benefit (in this verſe) is, that he will not leave them in their uncomfortable and Orphan-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but will come again unto them, not only in his bodily preſence after his reſurrection, and at the great day; but by his Spirit, as an aſſured pledge of his preſence, till at laſt he return to compleat their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is, oft-times, the weakneſſe of beleevers faith, and the abundance and greatneſſe of their diſcouragements, that promiſes muſt be often repeated, before they can admit of them, or be comforted in them; Therefore, after the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, of <hi>another Comforter,</hi> he muſt and doth over again tell them, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe.</hi> 2. Beleevers, in Chriſts abſence, and without him, will ſtand in need of great comfort, being like Orphans, expoſed to deceits and injuries, unable to do for themſelves, and having none to do for them, but deſolate and deſpiſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a prey to every one; for, ſo is ſuppoſed here, that they are <hi>comfortleſſe,</hi> or, <hi>Orphans,</hi> as the word is. 3. Albeit beleevers may be ſuch Orphans in themſelves, yet they have Chriſts Word for it, that they ſhall not be left ſo, but taken up and cared for by him; for, ſaith he, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe,</hi> or <hi>Orphans.</hi> 4. Let beleevers have what they will, yet they are ſtill Orphans and want comfort, unleſſe it come by the Spirit of Chriſt; for, it is by the Spirit this is made good, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe.</hi> 5. The Spirit in comforting, taketh the patronage of beleevers, as a Tutor of Orphans, guiding and defending them, and managing their affairs; So that they who expect his comfort, muſt give up themſelves to be led by him; for, it is by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that they are <hi>not left Orphans,</hi> but have him for a Tutor. 6. Chriſt loves ſo well to be preſent with his people, that he never withdraws his preſence one way, but he cometh to them another way; Therefore, ſaith he, when removing in reſpect of his bodily preſence, <hi>I will come to you.</hi> 7. When the Spirit cometh unto beleevers, Chriſt cometh unto them, not only becauſe they are one in eſſence; But partly, becauſe it is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to his bodily preſence, yea, and richly compenſeth all that ever any had thereby; So that they who have the Spirit, ought not to complain of his abſence in that way he was preſent with the diſciples, nor of any thing the Church can expect within time. And partly, becauſe the coming of the Spirit is not to obſcure Chriſt, or cauſe him to be forgotten, but to keep his memorial freſh, as if he were come again in perſon, of which more on <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 14. For theſe cauſes it is, that by ſending of the Spirit, <hi>I will come unto you,</hi> ſaith he.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond benefit they reap by enjoying of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is, a ſight of Chriſt, while as the world are to be deprived of the ſight they had and abuſed. This was performed not only, or ſo much, in their ſeeing him bodily after his reſurrection, as in a ſight of his ſpiritual preſence coming by his Spirit, whereby he will confirme his coming to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and which they ſhall enjoy in the preſent time (as the words read, <hi>ye ſee me</hi>) till they come to that everlaſting and full ſight in glory. The third benefit, is, life, whereby they are enabled to ſee and enjoy him, whereof he gives his own life, after his reſurrection, as a pledge. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It will not ſuffice beleevers that Chriſt do come unto, unleſſe it be gifted them alſo to diſcern and ſee him when he is come; Otherwiſe he may be preſent, and yet they want the comfort thereof, becauſe they ſee him not; Therefore, to the former promiſe, of his coming, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. this is added, <hi>ye ſee me.</hi> 2. It is the deplorable and woful eſtate of the world, that when Chriſt is moſt earneſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48148:156"/>
in comforting his own, they are thruſt by, as having nothing to do with theſe conſolations; Therefore is the encouragement guarded, and amplified from the contrary ſtate of the world; <hi>The world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me.</hi> 3. Whatever manifeſtation of Chriſt contemners of him enioy, they will be deprived of it; for, they are to be deprived of what they had of his bodily preſence, <hi>The world ſeeth me no more.</hi> 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt doth ripen faſt for a ſtroak; for, <hi>yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more.</hi> 5. Such as do not acknowledge Chriſts coming in the fleſh, ſhall never ſee his coming in the Spirit; and ſuch as deſpiſed Chriſt in his humiliation, deſerve that they ſhould never get another ſight of him to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for this alſo is imported in this, <hi>the world ſeeth me no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> not only that they ſhould not enjoy his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence, but that they ſhould ſee him no other way, as the contrary promiſe to the beleever maketh clear. 6. It is the great miſery of the wicked, that they are eternally debarred from a ſight of Chriſt in favour and mercy, though they will ſee him one day in terrour; for, ſo much alſo is imported in this general, <hi>The world ſeeth me no more.</hi> 7. As a ſight of Chriſt is the ſweet life and happineſſe of beleevers; ſo it is their advantage, that in ſaddeſt times, when Chriſt is, to outward appearance, dead and gone, and the world ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſeeing him; yet by his Spirit they ſhall enjoy a ſight of him, till they come to ſee him in glory; for, in oppoſition to the world, it is ſubjoyned as their comfort, <hi>but ye ſee me.</hi> 8. The Spirit of Chriſt is an enlivening Spirit, making beleevers capable of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; he is their preſent life, and a pledge of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eternally; for, it is added as another benefit by the Spirits coming, <hi>ye ſhall live.</hi> 9. Albeit our Lord Jeſus died for beleevers, yet it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of death but he roſe again and liveth for ever; for, it is held out as a truth after his departure through the valley of the ſhadow of death, <hi>I live.</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. 10. The life of beleevers is derived from Chriſts life, who is our Head, communicating quickening vertue by his Spirit to all his members; And their life ſtands in a continual dependance upon his life, without which it cannot ſubſiſt; for, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> 11. Chriſt hath made the life of beleevers in him as certain, as it is certain he liveth; ſeeing by his living after his death they are abſolved, and life is purchaſed to them, and in his exaltation, he hath taken poſſeſſion in their name, and ſtands engaged to make his members partake of his life and fulneſſe; for, ſo much alſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this, <hi>Becauſe I live ye ſhall live alſo.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth benefit redounding to them by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters coming, is, that whereas they had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed much ignorance of him, and of his unity with the Father; then they ſhould underſtand the great myſteries of Gods Kingdom, that he is in the Father, and conſequently the Father in him, and that there is a communion betwixt beleevers and him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Father and them in him. This was accompliſhed to the Apoſtles, when the Spirit was poured out, and is, in its own meaſure, made good to every beleever, in due time. And under this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the ſubſtance of the myſtery of Redemption, that there is an eſſential union betwixt the Father and him as God, and that as Mediatour, he is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by dependance, and the Father in him by ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his humane nature under his ſufferings, and by approbation; and that there is a myſtical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him (who is in the Father) as Head, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as members. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt be, oft-times, little known, yea, and much miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; yet it is moſt neceſſary to know him, and what his intereſt in the Father is: Therefore it is hold out as a ſingular fruit of the Spirit, to underſtand this. 2. Albeit true believers may be clouded with much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; yet Chriſt hath his time and way to make them underſtand the myſteries of God, to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſalvation; for, <hi>at that day,</hi> when he ſends the Comforter, <hi>ye ſhall know,</hi> though now ignorant. 3. Chriſt rightly known, will be ſeen to be one in eſſence with the Father, and conſequently, approven of him, and he in whom the Father is to be found; And to know this, is the great encouragement of believers; for, it is held out as their encouragement, <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am in the Father.</hi> 4. It exceedingly addes to the comfort of believers, to know that Chriſt, who is one with the Father, hath alſo a myſtical union and communion with them, ſo that God and ſinners tryſt together in Chriſt, who is in both, though in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner; for, this compleats the encouragement, <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> 5. The communion betwixt Chriſt and beleevers is mutual, they being in him by faith and needy dependance, and he in them by his Spirit, as the root of their ſpiritual being, and to make all his fulneſs forth-coming for them; for, it is, <hi>you in me, and I in you.</hi> 6. The communion betwixt Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is very near and intimate, ſo that there can be no ſeparation, and the fruits and comfort of it muſt be very real; Therefore is it called a being <hi>in</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 7. Believers may have an intimate communion with Chriſt, who yet ſtand in need to be made to know that it is ſo; for, this communion is true for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>I am in the Father, and you in me, &amp;c.</hi> and yet the knowledge of it is but to come, <hi>Ye ſhall know in that day.</hi> So that it is a great priviledge to know our priviledges already received.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The fifth benefit, (the ſame in ſubſtance with ſome of the former) is, that they ſhall be beloved of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him, and in teſtimony thereof, he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to them. This he illuſtrates and amplifies from their duty, and the qualification required in Chriſts diſciples; Namely, that they evidence love to him by their reſpect to his commandments; which as he had formerly inculcate, <hi>v.</hi> 15. as the way to obtain
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48148:156"/>
the Comforter, ſo he preſſeth it over again as the mean to attain to theſe benefits, which they were to reap by the Spirits preſence. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When Chriſt is moſt ſweetly comforting his people, it is not his minde they ſhould be emboldened to caſt off duty thereby, but rather that they be encouraged to duty, as the way to clear their right to theſe comforts, and to aſſure them, that what they receive, is not a deluſion, nor are they abuſing it; Therefore doth he again, in the midſt of theſe conſolations, put them in minde of duty, and of the evidences of true love to him. 2. Chriſt is a Law-giver to give Commandments to his people, and who renders them ſweet by coming from him who hath evidenced ſo much love to ſinners, and by ſo impoſing them, evidenceth that he knoweth their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and is ready to take employment to enable them to obedience; for, he owneth the rule of believers duty as his Law, <hi>my commandments.</hi> 3. As variety of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are impoſed upon believers; ſo it is the Will of Chriſt that none of them be ſlighted, and that none pleaſe themſelves in obſerving one or moe, when yet they lay others aſide; for, he requires a duty in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>his commandments;</hi> even all of them. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. 4. Chriſts commandments are not entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they ought, except when there is an endeavour of actual obedience thereunto; for, he requireth it of the approven man, that he <hi>keep my commandments.</hi> 5. None can make conſcience of obedience as becometh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they firſt know their duty, and unleſſe they have an high eſtimation of the authority of the Law, and excellencie of the thing commanded; for, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that firſt they <hi>have the commandments,</hi> by knowing them in their judgement, and by keeping them in their heart as a precious jewel, and then they will <hi>keep</hi> them, and teſtifie their reſpect thereto, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them ſtill in their eye, and regulating all their practice thereby. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. 5. Albeit many looſe profeſſours pretend love to Chriſt, who yet neglect their duty; yet, in Chriſts account, none do truly love him but theſe who make conſcience of obedience; Therefore, to refute all ſuch deluſions, he ſaith again, <hi>He</hi> (and he only) <hi>that hath my commandments, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he it is that loveth me.</hi> 7. Albeit we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, when we have done all, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. yet, of free grace through Chriſt, obedience will not want a reward; as here he promiſeth. 8. To get more confirmation and evidences of the love of God in Chriſt, is a rich reward and encouragement unto duty, and this every tender walker is ſure of; for, this is the promiſe here. 9. As the love of God in Chriſt doth prevent our love and obedience; ſo it is his will, that the ſenſible manifeſtations and refreſhful proofes thereof, be drawn out by us in the way of obedience, and diligent uſe of means; for, this is the order here, <hi>He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father;</hi> Not as if our love begun firſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. but that his love ſetting them on work to obedience, and begetting love in them, as it did prevent them, ſo it will give them a rich meeting. 10. As the love of God in Chriſt is the rich allowance of obedient beleevers, whatever they get beſide; ſo his conferring of his Spirit upon them, is a rich evidence of his love; for, that the Father and Son loveth them, is evidenced by the ſending of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it unto them, as the ſcope of this whole purpoſe teacheth. So doth it alſo prove Sonſhip, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 6. 11. Chriſt is ſo acceptable to the Father, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſpect him, are beloved of the Father, and his love and the Fathers do ſtill concurre, ſo that who is beloved of the one, is beloved of the other; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will love him.</hi> 12. Chriſts love to his people conſiſts not in empty complements, but in real manifeſtations of good-will; for, <hi>I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> 13. As Chriſt alloweth ſpecial manifeſtations of himſelf upon his own, by lifting up the light of his countenance upon them, by intimating his good-will unto them, his fulneſſe and righteouſneſſe for them: ſo this unto a beleever is above any evidence of his love beſide; Therefore is this given as the proof of his love to them, <hi>I will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelfe unto him.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. and 17.4. 14. As only beleevers and tender walkers are capable of ſpecial manifeſtations of Chriſt; ſo their tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo far from obſcuring of Chriſt, that the more tender they are, they will need more of Chriſt, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and righteouſneſſe, to be manifeſted to them, to cover them and the defects which they will diſcover in their walking; for, even a keeper of the commandments needs this encouragement, <hi>I will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> 15. Chriſt can be known only by his own light, and until he manifeſt himſelf, believers will remain ignorant of him, and be ready to miſtake him; for this cauſe, ſaith he, <hi>I will manifeſt my ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>In this and the two following verſes, this their duty and encouragement is further inſiſted on, by occaſion of <hi>Judas</hi> his queſtion, who is declared not to be the traitour, but a good man, the brother of <hi>James</hi> the ſon of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> and the Penman of that Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> as appears from the firſt verſe thereof, and who alſo is called <hi>Lebbeus, Matth.</hi> 10.3 with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.16. He in this verſe hearing of the former promiſe, deſireth to be informed how Chriſt would manifeſt himſelf to them, and not to the world. Which is to be underſtood not only of this manifeſtation, and the way of it, in it ſelf, and that <hi>Judas</hi> being acquainted only with bodily manifeſtation, wondreth how Chriſt ſhould ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his own, and the world not ſee him: But chiefly, he deſireth hereby to be informed of the cauſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord makes that difference in his ſpecial manifeſtations. And we are to conceive, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in this floweth not ſo much from any undervaluing thoughts of grace, as if it were not rich enough for all the world; nor yet from any low eſteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the reſt, making him wonder why they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this favour, when others, no worſe then they in themſelves, are ſecluded: As from ſome pride and conceit of ſomewhat in themſelves, differencing them from others, to which he deſireth Chriſts aſſent. As may be gathered from Chriſts neglecting to anſwer directly to his queſtion. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the Will of God, that neither the wicked be honoured, nor the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48148:157"/>
godly diſgraced, but that honeſt men ſhould be known and reputed ſuch, and that traitours be accounted what they are; Therefore, mentioning <hi>Judas,</hi> he guards that it was <hi>not Iſcariot,</hi> that none ſhould brand this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, becauſe he was of the ſame name. 2. Chriſts diſciples may finde many difficulties in his doctrine, which will put them to many queſtions; As here we ſee, comparing it with the practice of ſome of the reſt, even in this ſame chapter. 3. All doubts and difficulties, wherewith diſciples are puzled, ought to be put up to Chriſt for reſolution, as here <hi>Judas</hi> his practice doth teach 4. Ignorance, and carnal conceptions of the things of God, breed many difficulties in things that otherwiſe are very clear; for, ſo, <hi>how is it that thou wilt manifeſt, &amp;c?</hi> may relate to his conceit of a bodily manifeſtation, which makes it a difficulty to him, how a difference can be made. Though the other interpretation ſeem to reach the ſcope better. 5. There is a real difference put by Chriſt betwixt the world and his own, in the matter of ſpecial manifeſtations; for, ſo is here imported. 6. Albeit there be no cauſe in the creature, why Chriſt ſhould make this difference; yet even good men, when priviledges and mercies are heaped upon them, are ready to dream of ſome inherent worth in themſelves prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them above others; for, ſo much doth this queſtion teach, <hi>How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not to the world?</hi> that is, not only what way wilt thou take that the one ſhall ſee thee, and not the other, but what moveth thee to make the difference? wherein he deſireth ſomewhat from Chriſt, to confirme him in a conceit of ſome worth in them.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have Chriſts anſwer upon this queſtion; Wherein, 1. He repeats his doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their duty, aſſerting again, that love to him will draw men to keep his words and obey them. 2. He repeats and enlargeth the former encouragement, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that the Father and he will love ſuch, and that his manifeſtation of himſelf ſhall be by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and his coming to make abode with them. 3. He amplifieth this their duty from the contrary, <hi>v.</hi> 24. that diſobedience to the Word argueth, that there is no love to him, and that this is an hainous ſin, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct theſe comfortable promiſes, ſeeing the Word which they obſerve not, is the Fathers as well as his. Now for the ſcope of this anſwer in relation to <hi>Judas</hi> queſtion, we finde not that Chriſt doth directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his queſtion, either as to the way of this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, or cauſe of this difference in it. Only as by his propounding the matter in general, he curbs him for appropriating that priviledge to themſelves only; ſo by repeating and amplifying the former doctrine, he leads them from enquiring about others, to ſee to themſelves; and from ſtudying the ſecret counſel of God, and cauſes of his diſpenſations, to ſtudy the means that God hath appointed for attaining commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf, and to abhorre the contrary evils, becauſe of the ſinfulneſſe thereof, and becauſe they would deprive them of ſo great a mercy.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt be very tender of his people, yet he will not cheriſh them in their folly and humours, nor ſatisfie their curioſity or conceit; Therefore doth he ſo much wave his queſtion in this anſwer. 2. It is a great fault whe diſciples become curious priers into the caſe of others, and the ſecret counſel of God and cauſes thereof, neglecting what is commanded, and turning idle in the point of duty; for, this is the fault Chriſt findes in his queſtion, that it imports ſo much idleneſſe, as needs the enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of duty, and terrifying from diſobedience. As indeed, much idleneſſe in the point of real duty, makes but too much work about what we have nothing to do withal. 3. Whatever be Chriſts tender condeſcendence to his people, yet he will not lay aſide his Sovereignty over them, nor exempt them from duty; for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his encouragements, yet he ſtill inſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neceſſity of love and obedience, if they would partake of his comforts. 4. A true lover of Chriſt is faithful to him and his intereſts, and what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to him in his Word, he will carefully obſerve it, in his underſtanding, affection and practice; for, <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words.</hi> 5. Chriſt will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recal nor make void what he hath promiſed for the encouragement of his own, and whoſoever love him, ſhall finde themſelves richly recompenſed, in his and the Fathers free love: Therefore, ſaith he, again; <hi>And my Father will love him,</hi> to wit, in, and with, and through me. 6. Where God loveth any, both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son will make a ſweet and intimate fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, and will be at pains to make up the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for, <hi>we will come unto him &amp;c.</hi> 7. God and Chriſts fellowſhip with beleevers is conſtant, for all times, and all difficulties, till they be taken up to be with him for ever; for, <hi>we will make our abode with him.</hi>

Obedience to the commandments of God is not required as a ſimple act of love and courteſie; but as a teſtimony of ſubjection to divine authority: and theſe who will not ſtudie love to Chriſt that they may obey him, ought to look to the authority of God which will not be vilipended; Therefore is the authority of the Word thus held out to deſpiſers, as alſo to guard believers, that they be not driven from their duty by the

                  <p>The ſixth benefit which they ſhall reap by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it, inſtruction and teaching as he is the Spirit of truth. And that however Chriſt had taught them all things neceſſary, and yet they continued rude and incapable, and his doctrine was very dark to them, as appeareth by the many queſtions they had lately ſtarted, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 8, 22. yet the Holy Ghoſt ſhould effectually and clearly teach them all things, and bring to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what he had ſpoken, but they, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, negligence, or ſorrow, had forgotten. It is not needful for us to determine, whether theſe <hi>all things,</hi> to be <hi>taught</hi> by the Spirit, be the ſame with theſe <hi>all things,</hi> which Chriſt had ſaid, which the Spirit not only brings to remembrance, but doth make them plain unto them? or, whether, beſide what Chriſt had ſaid, and the Spirit brings to remembrance; ſome particulars were remitted to the Spirits imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and extraordinary teaching of the Apoſtles, as <hi>ch.</hi> 16.12, 13? For in this it ſufficeth us to know, that theſe <hi>all things,</hi> be what they will, were revealed to the Apoſtles for the good of the Church, and by them to the Church in writing; ſo that there is no room left for traditions, or extraordinary and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelations; Nor is it to be expected that the Spirit, who brings Chriſts doctrine to remembrance, as true and excellent, will reveal and teach any new thing contrary to what Chriſt ſaid, which were to make the Spirit to contradict himſelfe Yet, if we conſider the matter narrowly, we will finde that the Scripture warrants us rather to aſſert, that theſe <hi>all things</hi> which the Spirit taught them, were the ſame which Chriſt had ſaid. For <hi>chap.</hi> 15.15. Chriſt made known to them all that he had heard of his Father, namely, which is neceſſary for the Church to know, and <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. Chriſt, after his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, continued with them fourty dayes, inſtructing them, and <hi>ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> and that ſo fully, as their Commiſſion is limited to whatſoever he had already commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. It is true, the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12, 25, 40. mentions ſomewhat wherein he gave direction, being guided by the Spirit, to which the Lord had not ſo expreſſely ſpoken; But in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates eſpecially to things that had not been determined in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor to what Chriſt had ſaid; and however it be, theſe particulars are not ſufficient to make ſo general a diſtinction betwixt the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo here is held forth a twofold work of the Spirit in reference to Chriſts doctrine, 1. Whereas Chriſt had revealed to them the ſumme of all Chriſtian Religion, and yet they were not capable thereof; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit was ſent to enlighten their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to explain theſe things more fully and diſtinctly, which Chriſt had ſpoken ſummarily, as they were able to hear them; And of this is that to be underſtood, <hi>chap.</hi> 16.2. not of any new doctrine or articles of faith, but of the more diſtinct explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he had delivered. 2 The Spirit by this teaching, did bring to the Apoſtles remembrance, for their further confirmation, that theſe things had been ſpoken by Chriſt, though then they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and afterwards forgat them, as <hi>chap.</hi> 2.22. and 12.16. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The ſeed of the Word may be ſowen, whereof yet no viſible fruit may appear for a time; as here is to be ſeen in Chriſts ſpeaking to the diſciples, who for a time were not much (if at all) bettered by it. 2. The Word of the Lord may not be operative and fruitful, even in the godly, for a time, and when they firſt hear it, which yet afterward may do much good; for, Chriſt ſoweth the ſeed among the diſciples, which yet took not effect till the Spirit was poured out, and then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> did good. 3. The efficacy of the Word doth not alwayes accompany the outward Miniſtry, not doth it depend upon the ability and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the Teacher, unleſſe the Spirit do accompany it in the hearts of hearers; for, albeit even Chriſt (conſidered as an outward Teacher,) <hi>ſpake theſe things, being preſent with them,</hi> yet the <hi>Comforter</hi> is needed to make them effectual. 4. It is the Holy Spirit only who makes the Miniſtry and outward teaching effectual, and who, where he cometh, doth freely, fully, and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, make the Word plain and livelie to beleevers: for, albeit Chriſts Miniſtry took not effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

As the Spirit is the great Comforter of his Church, particularly by his teaching, which all tends to their comfort; ſo he is a Comforter to none, to whom he is not alſo a Sanctifier; for, <hi>the Comforter is the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in reſpect of his ſanctifying operation. 6. The ſpecial benefits, (and particularly, the Spirit) beſtowed upon beleevers, are given through the mediation of Chriſt, and ſerve to be tokens of his love and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them in his Kingdome; for faith he. <hi>The Father will ſend him in my Name.</hi> 7. The Apoſtles were fully inſtructed by the Spirit, in all things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, ſo that in the matter of Religion, nothing is to be hearkened unto, beſide, or contrary to that which God revealed to them, and by them to the Church; for, <hi>He ſhall teach you all things</hi> 8 The true Spirit of Chriſt taught the Apoſtles no other thing, but what Chriſt had ſaid unto them; nor doth he teach beleevers any thing but what Chriſt hath taught, by his Prophets, himſelf, and his Apoſtles: for, theſe <hi>all things</hi> which he ſhall teach, are <hi>all things whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> as hath been cleared. 9. Chriſts diſciples are frequently ſubject to forgetfulneſſe of what Chriſt ſaith unto them; occaſioned, partly, by their ignorance, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.16. partly, by the little intereſt and felt need they have of what the Word ſaith; partly, by their ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

negligence, being taken up with other things; and partly, by their truſting to their own underſtanding and memory; Therefore need they to have <hi>all things brought to remembrance.</hi> 10. The ignorance, dulneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe, of diſciples doth loſe them many a fair opportunity, and would irrecoverably deprive them of fair advantages, if mercy prevented it not; for, Chriſt, their wealth is away before they knew what it meant, and they are left ignorant and forgetful of what he had taught. 11. Such as are humbled under the ſenſe of their ignorance, and do ſeek after, and entertain the preſence of the Spirit, will finde him a remembrancer of ſaving truths, which they have heard, as they need them; for, <hi>He ſhall bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Chriſt being now about to cloſe this exhortation and part of his farewell-Sermon, doth, in this verſe point out the ſixth argument of conſolation; Namely, his peace, as a reſult of all the reſt, which both in its own nature, and donation, differeth far from the worlds peace. And upon this he repeats the exhortation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and ſo goeth on to the concluſion of this part of his diſcourſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts diſciples are allowed true peace in all diſpenſations, to uphold their hearts; So that whatever their outward trouble be, yet they may have peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. quiet under all diſpenſations, and an ordering of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, ſo as they need not marre their peace; for, <hi>peace</hi> is his allowance here. 2. True peace is Chriſts peace, as being the purchaſer thereof, the object in whom they have it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16 33. and he who gifts it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calls he it, <hi>my peace.</hi> 3. Chriſts peace doth not depend upon his bodily preſence, but may be continued when he is gone, and is an antidote to ſupply that want and loſſe; for, when he is to remove, <hi>peace I leave with you,</hi> ſaith he. 4. Whatever be the beleevers unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or not deſerving of peace, yet it may anſwer all objections, that it is Chriſts legacy and free gift; for, <hi>peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> 5. The excellencie of Chriſts legacies, and the priviledges enjoyed by his people, ought to be ſtudied as far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending what they enjoy at their beſt, who do not come to him; Therefore doth he make the compariſon betwixt the worlds peace and his. 6. Chriſts peace is far different from the peace which is given or enjoyed by the world; for that is, oft-times, in ſin, or is but a lethargy of ſecurity portending ſad trouble, or but (at beſt) a freedome from outward trouble, when yet thy are at enmity with God: But his peace is ſolide and true peace. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi> 7. Chriſts peace doth alſo differ from the worlds peace, in the way of giving it: They, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, give words of peace without reality, but he is real in what he ſaith; They may wiſh peace, when they cannot give it, but his peace is real and effectual, <hi>Joh.</hi> 34.29 They cannot perpetuate any peace they afford or wiſh, but his peace is firme, and he preſerveth his people in it. This alſo is imported in theſe words, <hi>not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi> 8. The heart-trouble, wherewith Saints are oft-times exerciſed, is ready to beget many heart-terrours and fears, for the future; for here, <hi>heart-trouble</hi> and being <hi>afraid,</hi> go together. 9. Chriſt may be dealing very comfortably with his people, when yet their perplexities and fears do continue and lye on; for, as at the beginning, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. ſo here, after all his ſweet diſcourſe, their diſtemper continueth, their <hi>heart is troubled,</hi> and it is <hi>afraid.</hi> 10. As there is no true cure of heart-troubles and fears, but in Chriſt; So his conſolations and peace are ſufficient to guard the heart againſt them all; So that Saints having this allowance, cannot without ſin continue in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; Therefore, after all theſe conſolations, and particularly, that of his peace, he repeats the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a duty which they cannot decline, <hi>Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ws of his departure, with joy, for which he giveth two reaſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. 2. A declaration that this was his farewell-Sermon, and therefore to be better hearkened unto, <hi>ver;</hi> 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe is contained. 1. The ſumme of what he is now teaching them, to wit, concerning his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and return again to them. 2. The uſe they ſhould have made, even of the ſaddeſt part of this doctrine, concerning his departure; Namely, not to be grieved and troubled, as they were, but rather to rejoyce. 3. What the want of this evidenced in them, even the want of ſuch love to him as became them, which would have made them rejoyce. 3. The firſt reaſon why they would rejoyce if they had loved him; Namely, becauſe he went to the Father who is greater then he, (not as God, but as man and Mediatour, and in his preſent ſtate of humiliation) and therefore his exaltation out of his eſtate of humiliation, into glory with the Father, ſhould have made them rejoyce, eſpecially conſidering that this his exaltation tended to their advantage. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. It is needful that diſciples conſider ſeriouſly what they hear, and that for this end, needful doctrines be frequently repeated and inculcate upon them; Therefore doth Chriſt put them in minde what they had heard; <hi>ye have heard how I ſaid unto you,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Saints are not to pore only on what is ſad in Chriſts doctrine or dealing, but to ſtudy alſo what lenitives he allowes, to ſweeten the other; Therefore, with his going, which is bitter, he mentions his return, which is as ſweet, <hi>ye have heard how I ſaid unto you, I go away, and come again to you.</hi> 3. Albeit there were no other encouragement
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48148:158"/>
by the way, during Chriſts abſence; Yet the hope of his coming again might allay the grief of his departure; Therefore, it is ſubjoyned, as a ſufficient lenitive, <hi>I go away, and come again unto you.</hi> 4. Not only Chriſts ſweet diſpenſations, but even the hardeſt trials of Saints, and his moſt ſharp diſpenſations to them, afford matter of joy, if rightly ſtudyed; Therefore doth he pitch upon the ſaddeſt of it, and urge it as matter of joy, <hi>ye would rejoyce becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the Father.</hi> See <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. 5. Chriſt by departing out of the world, is exalted unto a more glorious eſtate then that in which he was during his abode on earth; for, ſo is imported in that he <hi>goeth unto the Father, who is greater then he;</hi> Whereby, as man and Mediatour, he is advanced to be next in glory to the Father, and as God, he layeth aſide that vail under which he appeared in his ſtate of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and lets out that glory which he had with the Father before the world was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. 6. The exaltation of Chriſt is a ground of much joy to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as being not only his advancement, but an evidence that he hath accompliſhed all things for which he came into the world, and a pledge that he will execute his offices in a more glorious way, for their good; for, this is matter of joy, <hi>I go unto the Father, for the Father is greater then I.</hi> 7. It is the great fault of beleevers, that they chooſe rather to carp at Chriſts dealing, then to ſtudy matter of encouragement in it; and that their ſelfe-love, (deſiring to be much humoured and pleaſed) doth marre all right uſe of his diſpenſations: Therefore doth he give them a milde challenge, that their deſire to enjoy his bodily preſence, had marred the joy they might have gathered at his departure. 8. Saints may ſeem to have much fond love to Chriſt, and their love to make a great ſtir, when yet it is not love to him, but ſelf-love, that aileth them; Therefore, albeit they thought it was love to him that ſo diſquieted them, yet ſaith he, <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi> 9. True love to Chriſt will make a man ſubmit to what honours him, how much ſoever it croſſe them; for, albeit this ſeparation might be very ſad to them, yet, <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce becauſe I ſaid, I go unto my Father,</hi> to be exalted. 10. Albeit ſelf-love make Saints think they are upon the only way of their own good; Yet, upon ſerious ſearch it will be found that in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Chriſts will, they oppoſe their own real good alſo; for, his exaltation being for their advantage, they who rejoyced not at it, did forſake their own mercy.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This verſe contains a ſecond reaſon why they ought to rejoyce at this intimation of his departure to the Father; Namely, That this prediction, compared with future events proving his exaltation for their good, would confirme their faith. And therefore they were bound to rejoyce in whatſoever would advance faith. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It ſhould be the great ſtudy of Saints, in this vale of their pilgrimage, to acquaint themſelves with beleeving, as that whereby Chriſts bodily abſence is mainly ſupplied, and that which will bring them the peace and joy which is allowed upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. Therefore doth Chriſt take ſo much pains to train and breed them, <hi>that they might beleeve.</hi> 2. The ſcope of Chriſts Word to his people, is, to lead them to beleeve in him; for, <hi>now I have told you, that ye might beleeve.</hi> 3. Such as would rightly emprove Chriſts Word, for feeding of faith, ought to compare his dealing with his Word, and to ſee ſomwhat of him, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Word, in every thing that comes to paſſe; Therefore he requireth, that they not only hearken to what he <hi>told now, before it come to paſſe,</hi> but obſerve alſo what he doth, <hi>when it is come to paſs.</hi> 4. The compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts predictions with events according to the ſame, contributes much to the confirmation of faith; as pointing out Chriſts fore knowledge and providence, and the certainty of the Word, which he ſaileth not to accompliſh; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Now I have told you before it come to paſſe, that when it is come to paſſe, ye might beleeve.</hi> Compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.19. 5. Our Lord may make diſciples hard condition contribute more for their good, and the ſtrengthening of their faith, then if they had not met with theſe conditions; Therefore doth he ſo order it, that his departure and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof ſhall contribute ſo much to their further confirmation. 6. True diſciples ought to rejoyce in whatſoever may contribute to confirme their faith, how much ſoever it vex them otherwiſe; for, this is a reaſon why they ought to rejoyce, that this intimation contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <hi>that they might beleeve.</hi> 7. Whatever be Chriſts diſpenſations toward his people, yet he is not deficient in whatſoever is needful to encourage them to beleeve, and to confirme them in it; for, in all theſe ſad diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, he was ſtill doing what might help them to faith, <hi>that ye might beleeve.</hi> 8. As there is no faith, but it needs that we ſhould grow in it, (as here the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who beleeved, need to beleeve more;) So the Lord, when he gives many encouragements to beleeve, requires more faith of his people: for, now when he gives this new help, of a prediction and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof, he requireth an anſwerable meaſure of faith, <hi>That ye might beleeve,</hi> yet more. 9. Albeit we are ready to think that Chriſts bodily preſence were a notable help to faith; Yet Chriſt, by his exaltation unto glory, gives ſuch proofes of his deity and fulneſſe, and of his minding of his people, as layeth on a ſtricter obligation to beleeve in him, then any beſide; So that not to beleeve much now, is a more hainous fault, then at any other time; for, <hi>when it is come to paſſe,</hi> and evidenced by effects that he is gone to the Father, it is ſpecially required then, <hi>that ye beleeve.</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48148:159"/>
ſpeak much after this with them, being to enter the liſts with Satan at the Fathers commandment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be inferred (for nothing of his ſcope, or the uſe they were to make of this, is expreſſed here) that they were to hearken better to this diſcourſe of their Lord and Maſter in taking his leave, which could not but contain matter profitable to them, (as being his laſt words:) and not ſuffer themſelves to be diſtracted with fear and trouble. In the words there is, 1. An inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that he was ſhortly to break off diſcourſe with them, being to engage in his ſufferings, againſt Satan the prime inſtrumental cauſe therein. 2. To prevent any ſcandal that might ariſe upon his being expoſed to Satans malice, and his dying in that conflict; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that he went to dye, not becauſe Satan had any power over him, or ground of challenge againſt him in himſelfe, but meerly that he might teſtifie his love and obedience to the Father, who laid that duty upon him. 3. To teſtifie how willingly he obeyed this command, he declareth himſelfe willing to go meet his enemie, and warnes them to make ready to go out with him, to ſee his obedience acted, and withall, that they might have better opportunity to ſhift for themſelves. Now concerning this, that Chriſt bids them <hi>Ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. it ſhould ſeem that Chriſt at this word aroſe from the Communion Table, and that the reſt of his Sermon, and the Prayer, in the three following Chapters, were ſpoken, either on their feet in the ſame roome, or in the way to the garden. But it is clear from <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 1. that after all that, and not till then, he went forth; and with all, it is not very probable that this his ſolemne Sermon and Prayer were delivered in a confuſed poſture, or that Chriſt continuing ſtill in the ſame roome, would quit the grave and compoſed poſture wherein he and they were ſitting, and put them all to their feet to hear it out. And therefore it ſeems that by this exhortation, he only puts them in minde to make ready to go away when he had done; And ſo goeth on with his Sermon. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. When difficulties, to which we are called, draw near, we ſhould make ready to go and meet them; Therefore, Chriſt is making ready to meet with his ſufferings, &amp; intimateth that he would cloſe his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for that end. 2. It ſhould ſtir up beleevers to emprove opportunities of grace, and of Chriſts company, when they conſider how ſoon they may be deprived thereof; Therefore he ſtirs them up to attention, by putting them in minde that they would not have opportunity to hear him much after this. <hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you.</hi> 3. Chriſt will never be ſo throng, but he will take leiſure to ſpeak what is needful for his needy people; Therefore, albeit he knew the Jewes were making faſt ready, yet he ſaith not, he will talk no more, but <hi>not much,</hi> and for all the haſt, he goeth on to ſpeak out his minde; So in the midſt of his ſufferings, he hath a look to reclaime ſliding <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.61. and a word for his mother and <hi>John,</hi> when he is on the croſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.26, 27. 4. It is a point to be frequently ſtudyed, that Satan, through Gods permiſſion, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth a tyranical dominion among the ſinful children of men; that ſo it may be lamented that Chriſt wants ſo much of his due: for this cauſe is he ſo often pointed out to be <hi>the Prince of this world.</hi> 5. Chriſt in his ſufferings for the Elects ſin, had to do, not only with the malice and cruelty of men, but with Satan and the powers of hell, who alſo have chiefe hand in all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the Saints; Therefore doth he deſcribe his ſufferings from this cauſe, <hi>The prince of this world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> to wit, in, and with his inſtruments, to uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours againſt him. 6. It may adde much to the comfort of Saints, that Satan and all his forces did bend and eſſay their ſtrength againſt Chriſt their ſurety; So that if they prevailed not againſt him, Saints may, in him, look upon them as conquered enemies; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he recorded for our comfort, that <hi>the prince of this world cometh</hi> againſt him. 7. Albeit the beſt of men have much within them, of corruption and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, upon which Satan may faſten his tentations and ſuggeſtions, and enflame them with his fiery darts; and much guilt, upon which he may accuſe and foile them, if left to themſelves: Yet Chriſt being without ſinne, Satan had no power over him in any of theſe reſpects: for, <hi>he hath nothing in me,</hi> that is, his power over men came in only by ſin in them, but Chriſt being free of ſin, Satan had nothing of his own in him, either of guilt, for which to accuſe him, or of corruptions, upon which to faſten his tentations, and make them prevaile. 8. It is beleevers great advantage, that what Chriſt did undergo was for nothing in himſelfe, but all for them; Therefore doth he hold out, for their comfort, <hi>he hath nothing in me.</hi> 9. All the power, malice, and policy, of Satan cannot prevail over Chriſt, and his followers in him, ſave in ſo far as God permitteth; for, ſo much alſo is imported in this, <hi>he hath nothing in me,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, could not prevail or have power over him, unleſſe he voluntarily yeilded himſelfe to ſuffer, as is after ſubjoyned. 10. Satan is ſo malicious a tempter and aſſaulter, that he will not ſpare even theſe in whom he hath no right, and againſt whom he knoweth he will not ſucceed; for, he <hi>cometh</hi> againſt Chriſt, though <hi>he hath nothing in him.</hi> And therefore they who take all his tentations for currant, do far miſtake; for he durſt offer to call in queſtion unto Chriſt himſelfe, if he was the Son of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. 11. All that Chriſt ſuffered for the Redemption of ſinners, was by the order, and at the command of the Father, who did Covenant with him concerning this work; for, <hi>as the Father gave me commandment, even ſo I do.</hi> 12. In our going about duty, and enduring of hard lots, it is good to eye the will and appointment of God, not only that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not wrong ends, but that we may look more to God and his minde in theſe lots, then to mens malice and projects; Therefore doth Chriſt ſo much faſten his eye, not on Satan, but, on the Fathers <hi>commandment.</hi> 13. As love to God ought to be the riſe of all our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſo true love to him will draw men to obedience, in hardeſt ſervices; for, herein Chriſt hath caſt a coppy, the motive of whoſe ſuffering was love to the Fathers glory, <hi>I love the Father, and as the Father gave me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, even ſo I do.</hi> 14. It is of ſingular importance and uſe, that men do ſtudy Chriſts love and obedience to the Father in his ſufferings, both for admiration and delighting in it, and for imitation; for, he doth this, <hi>that the world may know that I love the Father, and that as the Father gave me commandment, even ſo I do.</hi> 15. Chriſt alloweth not that men ſay much of their love and obedience, unleſſe they prove it by practice; Therefore after he hath profeſſed ſo much of his love and obedience, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let us go hence,</hi> that I
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48148:159"/>
may give proofe thereof. 16. Chriſt did enter the liſts, in his ſufferings, with much willingneſſe and alacrity, with much courage and reſolution; That ſo he might commend his love to us, and encourage us to do the like through him. Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> that I may grapple with the difficultie. 17. Chriſt was ſo real in his reſolute undergoing of ſufferings and death, that he did not decline any witneſſes and triers thereof; Therefore, ſaith he to them, <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> taking them out with him, not only that he being taken in the Garden, they might have better opportunity to flee, then if he were taken in that roome, but that being with him, they might, as much as they durſt, be witneſſes of his willingneſſe and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter Chriſt continueth his farewell-Sermon to the diſciples; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them that they would ſtudy communion with him by ſaith, whereby they might not only enjoy his preſence (which they ſo much deſired) in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner; but alſo might be made fruitful, which is ſo acceptable to him: And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inſiſting that they ſhould love one another, as he had loved them; and that ſo much the rather, as they ſhould meet with much hatred in the world.</p>
               <p>So the Chapter may be taken up in three parts. The firſt part contains an exhortation to communion with him and fruitfulneſſe in obedience. For which end. <hi>1.</hi> In bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed expreſſions, from a vine, husbandman, and branches, he premits a general doctrine, pointing out the order of divine diſpenſation of ſpiritual things, for enabling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours to fructifie, and Gods anſwerable dealing, with them, according as they declare themſelves, <hi>ver. 1, 2. 2.</hi> He makes application of this to the diſciples; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſort of branches they were, <hi>ver. 3.</hi> and, exhorting them, partly, to perſeverance in communion with him, as the root and cauſe; from the conſideration of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe without him, and their fruitfulneſſe being in him, <hi>ver. 4, 5.</hi> From their danger, if they neglect it, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> and, from the advantage of acceſſe to God, if they be in him, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> And partly, unto fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond part of the Chapter, having preſſed fruitfulneſſe in general, he ſingles out one peculiar fruit, of mutual love, as moſt neceſſary for them in his abſence: And preſſeth it from his own example, <hi>ver. 12.</hi> And to enforce this. <hi>1.</hi> He giveth evidences of his love to them, in his dying for them, <hi>ver. 13.</hi> (which is a friendſhip, in which they ſhould aſſure themſelves of an intereſt, <hi>ver. 14.</hi>) in communicating ſecrets with them, <hi>ver. 15.</hi> and, in preventing them by his grace, and furniſhing them with ability, in their perſons and callings, to glorifie him, and giving them acceſſe unto God for any thing they wanted, <hi>ver. 16. 2.</hi> Upon this he repeats and enforceth the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by way of concluſion, <hi>ver. 17.</hi> In the third part of the Chapter, he forewarns them of the hatred and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were to meet with in the world, and armeth them againſt the ſame, by ſeveral arguments of conſolation and encouragement. Some whereof do guard them againſt ſtumbling at their own afflicted condition: And are taken: From his own example and lot, <hi>ver. 18.</hi> From their good condition, which their trouble from the world evidenceth, and the inevitableneſſe of trouble, conſidering they are not of the world, <hi>ver. 19.</hi> From the equity that was in exerciſing them with that lot, and the inevitableneſſe thereof, conſidering their relation to Chriſt, <hi>ver. 20</hi> and, from the goodneſs of their cauſe, <hi>ver. 21.</hi> Some of them do yet further vindicate the former arguments from any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception might be made againſt them. For whereas in them it is ſuppoſed, that Chriſt was unknown and hated in the world, and they would be hated for his ſake, at which his weak followers might ſtumble; Therefore Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds arguments not only to encourage them under their ſad lot, but to obviate all ſcandal and offence at his being hated in the world, and his followers for ſo good a cauſe: Namely, That this hatred of him did evidence the miſerable condition of perſecutors, as being inexcuſable, and haters of the Fathers alſo, <hi>ver. 22, 23, 24.</hi> That this their unjuſt hatred was foretold in Scripture, <hi>ver. 25.</hi> and, that all theſe unjuſt aſperſions againſt him ſhould be wiped off by the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt concurring with, and aſſiſting them in their miniſterial teſtimony concerning him, <hi>ver. 26, 27.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt being in the firſt part of this Chapter to recommend communion with himſelfe, and fruitfulneſs, to his diſciples; He doth (in this and the next verſe) premit a general doctrine thereunto, in borrowed tearmes, conſiſting of two branches; Whereof the firſt (in this verſe) points out the order of divine diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for enabling profeſſours to fructifie; That himſelf reſembles a vine, being the vine-ſtock into which the branches are engraſſed, and he and his members a vine with many branches; That the Father reſembleth an husbandman, in his care about this vine: and, That profeſſours are as branches engraffed into him the vine, that ſo they may fructifie, as is here ſuppoſed, and is further intimate in the next verſe. Now we need not inſiſt on the occaſion or riſe of this diſcourſe, whether it was upon ſeeing a vine from the window of the roome, or becauſe this Metaphor is very frequent in Scripture, or was fit for his preſent purpoſe; Nor is it convenient to inſiſt on theſe borrowed expreſſions and compariſons further then may ſet out Chriſts preſent ſcope; which is, That Chriſt is the root and fountain of his peoples ſpiritual ſubſiſtence and fruitfulneſſe, and that the Father hath a ſpecial hand and care about him and them, for that end. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1.

are neither unuſual, nor obſcure, in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; whereby one thing is ſaid to be another, though diſtinct in their nature and kinde; And that without any tranſmutation of the one into the other, or annihilation of either: But becauſe of ſome myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal repreſentation and ſignification, or becauſe of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of properties and effects: Therefore doth Chriſt ſay here, <hi>I am the Vine,</hi> accounting that expreſſion nothing obſcure to his rude diſciples, although he and a vine were very different things, only becauſe it did reſemble him in ſome reſpects 2 Spiritual minds may and ought to profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> much, by the obſervation of common things, and by improving of them to ſpiritual uſe and advantage; Therefore doth Chriſt uſe theſe borrowed termes, to teach them, whenever they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved vines, (which were plentiful in that countrey) to be put in minde thereby of ſomewhat in Chriſt. And to this ſcope do his other parables, taken from common things, tend. 3. Chriſt, in his offices and relations to his people, doth moſt fitly reſemble a vine; as being but ſmall and weak in outward appearance in the ſtate of his humiliation, as vines are eſpecially in winter; As being planted in the fat ſoile of the love, life and favour of the Father, the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the Spirit without meaſure, that he may have influence in abundance for all his members: As vines are planted in a fruitful ſoile, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2. as ſpending himſelf in fruitfulneſſe to his people, as vines are only uſeful for fruit-bearing; as yielding refreſhful and ſweet fruit, to cheer up the hearts of his people; as the vine doth for the uſe of man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. as ſubmitting to be trod in the wine preſſe of Gods anger, that thereby fruit might redound to his people, as the fruit of the vine is preſſed, that it may be drink unto men; and, as being the root in which all his members muſt ſubſiſt, and the fountain of all their ſpiritual life and furniture, as the vine is to all its branches. For theſe, among other cauſes, doth Chriſt reſemble himſelf unto a vine in Scripture: And here eſpecially for the laſt cauſe, <hi>I am the Vine.</hi> 4. What Chriſt is unto his people, that he truly and really is, whatever they look to beſide for ſpiritual ſupport and influence, will but deceive them: And whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie there be in good and neceſſarie things for the uſe of man, it is all but a ſhadow of that perfection which is in him for the good of his people, and what they are in their kinde weakly, that he is in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way in his kinde; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I am the true Vine:</hi> not that he really is a vine, or that a vine is not true in its own kinde; but that he, and he only, is that fountain of grace and life unto his people, which is pointed at under this ſimilitude; and that in his fulneſſe in this kinde, he far outſtrips the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the vine in its kinde. 5. As Chriſt, in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his people, reſembles the vine; ſo the Father in this matter reſembleth an husbandman; As being the planter of this vine, and appointer of Chriſt to be the Head of the Elect, and endowing him with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and fulneſſe for that effect; As being alſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffer of the branches in the ſtock, by bringing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to Chriſt, and giving them faith whereby they are united to him: And, As, teſtifying his love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this new plantation, by caring for it, viſiting, ſupporting, protecting, pruning and purging it, that it may be fruitful; for theſe cauſes ſaith he alſo, <hi>my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the husbandman.</hi> By which we are taught that both the Father and the Son do concurre in procuring and promoving the proſperity of beleevers.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond branch of this general doctrine points out the Fathers various and anſwerable diſpenſations, as Husbandman toward profeſſours and branches of this vine, according as, by their fruitfulneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſſe, they declare themſelves to be true or counterfeit branches, and to be really, or in ſhew only, engraffed in Chriſt. Taking away ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, and purging the fruitful, that they may abound in fruit. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The condition of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours is moſt fitly reſembled to branches of a vine; as having no ſubſiſtence nor ſap of themſelves, but in Chriſt, more then branches have without a vine-ſtock; and, as being obliged to have as ſtrict and near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him, as branches have with the tree; Which they will have, if they be really engraffed in him: For theſe cauſes doth he call them <hi>branches,</hi> here. 2. Profeſſours are not all of one ſort, nor are they all in Chriſt after one way and manner; ſome being only in him, by external and viſible communion, as being in the viſible Church, and externally cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting and profeſſing relation to him; others being alſo in him by faith, as having ſpiritual inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his perſon; for, ſo is here expreſſed, that there are <hi>branches in him</hi> who bear not fruit, and branches that bear fruit. 3. The true touch-ſtone whereby to diſcerne one ſort of branches from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, not their leaves or profeſſion, but their fruit; for, here the character of the one, is, <hi>every branch in me that beareth not fruit,</hi> and of the other, <hi>every branch that beareth fruit.</hi> And in this they fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble vine-branches, which are uſeleſſe if they be not fruitful, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.2, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> 4. External and fruitleſs branches will at laſt be taken away, by the diſcovery of their hypocriſie and unſoundneſſe, and that they have no intereſt in him; ſometime alſo by their juſt ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Church ſociety, and at laſt by their final ſeparation from Chriſt; for, <hi>every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away,</hi> as the Husbandman taketh away uſeleſſe branches from the vine. See <hi>v.</hi> 6. 5. There is no branch ſo fruitful, but it hath many imperfections and wants; for, even <hi>every branch that beareth fruit</hi> needeth to be <hi>purged,</hi> and to <hi>bring forth more fruit.</hi> 6. One particular imperfection in fruitful branches, is, that they have many luxuriant ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, growing up with their fruit, which hinder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof; Not only a remainder of corruption, but much corruption growing up with their grace, eſpecially when they are in a flouriſhing condition without exerciſe; Therefore do they need to be <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> as vine-dreſſers do with luxuriant branches in vines, which grow up with their fruit. 7. Whatever be the imperfections of theſe who hold inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt; yet they ſhall not be taken away,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48148:160"/>
nor ſeparate from him, but their imperfections and frailties ſhall endear them to the Lords care; for ſuch branches ſhall not be taken away, but <hi>purged.</hi> 8. It is a rich bleſſing and reward of fruitfulneſſe, in the godlies account, to be bleſſed with more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; for, this is a promiſe to them, <hi>it ſhall bring forth more fruit.</hi> 9. However the Lords dealing with his people may croſſe their humours, and cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperfluities, which are dear to them; yet he minds their real good, and fruitfulneſſe thereby; for, <hi>he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, that it may bring forth more fruit</hi> 10. Men are then aſſured that the operations of the Lords Word and Spirit upon them, and the afflictions and croſſes they meet with, are bleſſed to purge them from their droſſe, when they abound in ſolid and real fruits; for, when <hi>he purgeth it, it bringeth forth more fruit.</hi>

                  <p>Followeth the ſecond thing in this part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein application is made of this general do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the diſciples caſe, in a declaration, and an exhortation. In this verſe is contained a declaration what ſort of branches they were; Namely, not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but <hi>clean</hi> ones, that is, who by being purged and cleanſed from their ſuperfluities, (as is promiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 2.) are aſſured that they are fruitful branches, really and internally engraffed in Chriſt; and ſo were they rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, juſtified, and ſanctified, in part. This their purity is amplified from the inſtrumental cauſe or meane thereof, which is the Word he had ſpoken to them. Whereby we are to underſtand, partly, that the Word preached by him, and beleeved by them, and the mean which wrought on them to come to him to be cleanſed; and partly, and more particularly, becauſe by the general ſentences already pronounced by him concerning beleevers in him, (ſuch as that, <hi>John</hi> 3.36.) and more eſpecially, by that ſentence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their favours, applying that general to them, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.10. they might be confirmed and aſſured that they were already clean and juſtified. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of all Profeſſours to make ſure what intereſt they have in Chriſt; and for that end, to finde ſome difference betwixt them and formal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſours; Therefore, Chriſt ſpeaking of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of branches, findes it needful to aſſure them that they were not of the worſt, but beſt ſort, <hi>Now ye are clean,</hi> to learn them and all others to make that ſure. 2. Albeit it be the duty of Profeſſours, who are doubtful of their ſtate, to ſtudie after fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Gods way, whereby at laſt they will come to have their intereſt cleared; yet it is a notable encouragement to fruitfulneſſe, if firſt they be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of an intereſt, and they are to make much uſe of faith for that end; Therefore doth Chriſt premit this, <hi>Ye are clean,</hi> that hereby he may make way for the following exhortation to fruitfulneſſe. 3. Such as are indeed ingraffed in Chriſt, are alſo indeed clean, not only by imputation of his righteouſneſſe, hiding all their impurity, but by ſanctification alſo, whereby they are clean in part, in reſpect of what they were, and others ſtill in nature are, and a purification of them is begun, which will conſtantly be carried on, till it be perfected in the day of Chriſt; Therefore is a branch in him, <hi>v.</hi> 2. declared here to be a clean branch, <hi>Ye are clean.</hi> And thus doth he graciouſly account of them, notwithſtanding their many ſpots, whereas he would look otherwiſe upon a painted Phariſee. 4 As it is the work of the Spirit, and of faith, to apply Chriſts merit and efficacie for cleanſing of ſinners; ſo his Word is alſo inſtrumental therein; as being the glaſſe wherein to ſee our corruption; that which ſets us on work to ſeek purging, which diſcovers our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; and, which being hid in the heart by faith, will keep us from ſin; for, <hi>Ye are clean through the Word that I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> So that where the Word is not operative on men, it is no evidence they are purged, or that what they ſeem to be, is real. 5. Such, as by faith have fled to Chriſt for righteouſneſſe, and are ſet on work by the Word to ſtudy ſanctification, are (by vertue of Chriſts ſentence pronounced in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that beleevers ſhall not be condemned, but have eternal life) actually juſtified and abſolved from ſin in Gods ſight, albeit as yet they have not attained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Chriſt by this declaration, having aſſured them of their good eſtate, doth now ſubjoyne his exhortation; wherein, he doth preſſe them to communion with him, from ſeveral arguments and conſiderations, to <hi>v.</hi> 8. And becauſe fruitfulneſſe is the neceſſary effect thereof, which he aims at in the exhortation, therefore he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and commendeth it alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>In theſe verſes is contained, 1. The exhortation to perſeverance in cloſe communion with himſelf, as the root and cauſe of that fruitfulneſſe which he requireth of his members. 2. This is not only preſſed by an argument couched in the very boſome of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their abiding in him is the way to have him abiding in them, and ſo the communion ſhould be mutual; But further, there is the firſt expreſſe reaſon and argument preſſing the exhortation, ſubjoyned; And it is taken from the inſeparable connexion that is betwixt communion with him, and fruitfulneſſe, ſo that the latter cannot be without the former. This he
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48148:161"/>
declareth, 1. Negatively, That without him, and communion with him, they can no more be fruitful, then a branch that abideth not in the vine. 2. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, That abiding in him, they ſhall abound in fruit; which again is confirmed and amplified by their impotencie to do any thing without him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When beleevers are aſſured of their good condition, it is their duty to cheriſh it, and perſevere in it; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne this exhortation to the former declaration. 2. It is the duty, and will be the practice of lively beleevers, who are in Chriſt, to entertain the ſenſe of their own impotencie and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to love to be kept in a dependance on Chriſt; that ſo they may ſtudy an intimate and conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him, and dependance on him; for, ſo much is imported in this exhortation, <hi>Abide,</hi> which imports conſtancy, and that <hi>in me,</hi> which imports in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy. 3. Such is our dulneſſe and lazineſſe, and our averſeneſſe from ſelf-denial, and the way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance; that even when we have taſted the good of communion with Chriſt, we have need to be exhorted and encouraged to continue in it; for, ſo much do theſe exhortations, and the preſſing thereof with ſo many arguments, import. 4 As the conjunction and inhabitation muſt be mutual betwixt Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; ſo the union ſhall not break on his ſide, but if they abide in him by faith and needy dependance, he will not faile to abide in them by his gracious preſence and furniture: for, ſaith he, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you.</hi> The latter part whereof is not an exhortation, (ſave in ſo far as he exhorts them, by abiding in him, to continue his preſence with them) but a promiſe. 5. Holineſſe and fruitfulneſſe ought and will be ſo lovely and deſirable in the eſteem of true believers, that the hope of progreſſe therein will perſwade them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the uſe of all appointed means, and particularly, to make much uſe of Chriſt; Therefore it is urged as a preſſing Argument to abide in Chriſt, that unleſſe they do ſo, they cannot be fruitful; And the urging of this as an Argument, is in effect the exhortation to fruitfulneſſe, which afterward is further preſſed and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. 6. It is as certain that a perſon not abiding in Chriſt, for ſecuring the ſtate of his perſon, and for continual influence and furniture, cannot do good works, as it is certain a withered branch, cut off from a tree, cannot bring forth fruit: for, <hi>as the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</hi> 7. As beleevers are to ſtudie their own emptineſſe, ſo ought they to ſtudie the fulneſſe of Chriſt, as able and willing to ſupply all their wants, if they abide in him; for, theſe two are held out together, that he is <hi>the vine,</hi> as they are the <hi>branches.</hi> 8. The more we ſtudy faith in Chriſt, and cloſe and conſtant adherence to him, the more will we, not only be fruitful, but abound in fruit; for, <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> 9. It is no eaſie matter to convince beleevers of their own inſufficiency without Chriſt, but again and again ſelf-conceit will lift up its head, unleſſe it be frequently hammered down; therefore it is again needful to aſſert, <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> 10. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever moral commendable actions men may do upon moral principles; yet unleſſe a mans perſon be in Chriſt, he is utterly impotent to do a good and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able work; And whatever a regenerate man may do by the power of gifts, or habits of grace received; yet he cannot do it in a lively and acceptable way, without a conſtant dependance, and entertaining of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; for, it is an argument why they ſhould be, and abide in him, <hi>without me,</hi> or <hi>being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from me, ye can do nothing.</hi> 11. It is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that men ſee their impotencie to do greater or more difficult things without Chriſt, unleſſe alſo they be convinced of inability to do the leaſt thing; for, the aſſertion is, <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. 12. The ſenſe of our inability is never rightly ſtudied, when either we lie ſecure or diſcouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, unleſſe it be an argument inviting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us to draw near unto Chriſt; Therefore, it cometh in here by way of argument preſſing that they would abide in him, that they may have much fruit, <hi>for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument preſſing the exhortation, is, an enlargement of what is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and taken from the danger of Apoſtaſie, and which theſe Profeſſours will incurre, who being outwardly, by viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Chriſt, do not evidence the reality of their inward fellowſhip, by conſtant adherence to him, and drawing vertue from him for fruitfulneſſe, but do fall off and decline. This is held forth under the uſual ſimilitude, that as branches which do not incorporate with the tree, but do hang by it, or fall off, are by the vine-dreſſer caſt away, and having withered a while, are gathered to be fewel for the fire; ſo rotten members who make Apoſtaſie, are cut off from Chriſt, and in due time ſent unto the pit. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the caſe of theſe who are altogether without Chriſt is dreadful; ſo their caſe is much ſadder who have been in Chriſt by viſible Profeſſion, and ſtudy not reality that they may abide. Saddeſt of wrath will look them in the face when they look out of Chriſt, and go from him; for, ſuch is the threatning here againſt them that <hi>abide not in him.</hi> 2. Albeit no real Saints can totally and finally fall away and periſh; yet the Elect have need that the danger of Apoſtaſie, and the dreadful wrath following upon it, be laid before them, to make them afraid of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; Therefore is this threatning laid before the diſciples, to preſſe them to their duty, albeit it will be only verified in the outward fruitleſſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And the propounding thereof to the diſciples, doth not import they were of that ſort, or that they could make total defection from Chriſt and grace; but only that there is an inſeparable connexion betwixt ſuch Apoſtaſie and wrath. And this intimation of the danger of Apoſtaſie is one of Chriſts means, whereby he makes the Elect to perſevere. 3. As Apoſtates do voluntarily fall off, and chooſe to depart from Chriſt, ſo he doth caſt them forth as fruitleſſe branches, by giving them judicially up to their Apoſtate courſes, (whereby Chriſt will diſown them, as having no intereſt in him, his love and favour, according as they renounced him) if not alſo by their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48148:161"/>
from the ſociety of the Church; and all this as but an earneſt of his rejecting of them for ever; for, <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch.</hi> 4. Apoſtates, who are fallen off from Chriſt, and given up by him, will not only dry up in all their gifts and ſeeming graces, their performances and faire bloſſomes of profeſſions; but ſhall grow worſe and worſe, and ripen in prophanity by degrees, till the day come, wherein all their falſe hopes and peace, their carnal joy and ſenſual comforts, ſhall quite dry up and forſake them; for, as a branch caſt out of the vineyard, ſo ſhall they <hi>wither.</hi> 5. Whatever Apoſtates may think they reap for the preſent, yet the iſſue of Apoſtaſie will be eternal wrath and hell, which is only ſuſpended till their cup be full; And in the laſt day all Apoſtates ſhall be ſent thither together; for, they ſhall be as withered branches, which <hi>men gather, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi>

                  <p>The third argument preſſing the exhortation, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo the exhortation is repeated and further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) is taken from the great advantage of acceſſe to God, and ſucceſſe in prayer, if they be, and abide in him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the communion betwixt Chriſt and beleevers is very intimate; ſo they who have attained to it, need frequent up-ſtirring to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in it, not only to prove the reality of what they have thereby, and that by continuance they may reape the fruits of communion, which they will not finde at firſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.31, 32. But alſo becauſe for the moſt part men are ſo ignorant of the way of conſtant employing of Chriſt in all things; ſo unwilling to deny themſelves and depend; ſo ready to ſwell with conceit, if they have any thing for preſent; And ſo hotly aſſaulted with tentations, if their faces be toward Chriſt; and kept ſo poor and empty in themſelves, in Chriſts deep wiſdome, that they get not leave to run away from him; That they are every day ready to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this duty: Therefore it muſt be again recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, that <hi>ye abide in me.</hi> 2. Albeit when a man hath fled to Chriſt, he may exerciſe him ſharply, and permit him to be buffeted very ſore; yet nothing doth warrant him to give over abiding in him, or to think that Chriſt will caſt him off; for, whatever his dealing be, we are allowed to credit nothing to the prejudice of his Word, which ſtill ſaith to ſuch, <hi>Abide in me.</hi> 3. Such as do entertain communion with Chriſt, will not only be much converſant with his Word, but will ſtudy to have it deeply rooted and conſtantly ſetled in their heart, by faith, meditation and prayer; for, of ſuch as abide in him, it is verified, <hi>my words abide in you.</hi> See <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. 4. The way how ſuch as have fled to Chriſt, to finde communion with him, ought to take him up and finde communion mutual, is, in and by the Word; for, on our part, when we are driven out of our ſelves to be found in him, our only recourſe is not to ſeek to climbe up to heaven, or deſcend to the deep, but to lay hold on him in a word of promiſe, and to truſt to it, whatever be the verdict of tentation, or ſenſe or diſpenſations. And on his part; He is to be found in his Word, hid in our heart by faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſought without his Word, he is ſought without himſelf; and it is by his breathings on his Word laid up by faith in our hearts, that he ſenſibly evidenceth how near he is to us. Therefore, in place of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in us, as the other branch of mutual communion, he puts the words <hi>abiding,</hi> to ſhew that he is to be found only in his Word, and that they who have the Word abiding in them by faith, have him abiding in it. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. 5. As it is ſenſe of need which driveth beleevers to Chriſt; ſo by their coming to him, their ſenſe of need is not taken away, but rather augmented; their clearer light making greater diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and enjoyments begetting much work and many errands; for, here it is ſuppoſed, if they <hi>abide in him,</hi> they will have yet more work for prayer. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is by this means that he keeps them abiding in him, whereas otherwiſe they would be ready to run away. So that to grow in ſenſe of need is not a mark of one wanting communion, but of the contrary. 6. Whatever be the wants and neceſſities of them who keep communion with Chriſt; yet abiding in Chriſt will breed them, that they can ſee no out-gate but by prayer, nor can they eſſay any other mean till firſt they go to God; for, Abiders in Chriſt are put to <hi>ask,</hi> and ſee the neceſſity and excellency of prayer. 7. As prayer is the only out-gate for abiders in Chriſt, ſo they are actual ſupplicants, and their keeping of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion promoveth prayer, the Spirit being a Spirit of prayer in them, and their keeping communion with him, making them delight to have many errands to him, that ſo they may be much in his company: for, of them it is ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall ask.</hi> 8. Such as keep commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, will thereby finde a conformity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved betwixt God and their will, in the matter of their deſires; ſo that in ſo far as they are renewed and hold, communion with him, their unruly luſts will be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their unlawful deſires, whether for matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or end, will be laid aſide, and they will acquieſce in the good pleaſure of God, and ſeek the moſt excellent things; Therefore it is offered here, <hi>Ask what ye will;</hi> Not that men are warranted to pray for what they will, or to expect an anſwer in whatſoever they deſire; but that in ſo far as they <hi>abide in him, and his words abide in them,</hi> their wills will be limited in asking, by his Word and Will, and the Spirit in them will make interceſſion according to the Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. Though otherwiſe their unrenewed part will be debording, and when they interrupt their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, luſts will make their prayers muddie. 9. Such as keep communion with Chriſt will not only ſee their wants, and be put to prayer, but they will have an high eſtimation of the anſwer of their prayers, as a thing they cannot want; for, it is an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, that <hi>it ſhall be done unto them.</hi> 10. A right ſenſe of need in ſupplicants, and a due eſtimation of the hope of audience, is an argument to move them to entertain communion with Chriſt, and not to go far from him, leſt they miſſe their help when they have moſt need; for, it is an argument, ſtrongly preſſing them to abide in him, that what they <hi>ask, ſhall be done</hi> to them. See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. 11. Such as, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48148:162"/>
communion with Chriſt, do conforme their deſires to his will, and preſent and proſecute them by prayer, though they were never ſo many, or difficult to compaſs; yet they ſhall get a good anſwer, and they, dwelling conſtantly in Chriſts boſome, ſhall finde it but a ſhort ſtep to go to God through him; and get audience in every particular need; for, <hi>ye ſhall ask,</hi> even, <hi>what ye will, and it ſhall be done to you.</hi> And albeit he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſupplicants for a time, for their good, yet they ſhall ſucceed at laſt, according to the tenour of the promiſe. See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13, 14. Whereas the ill entertainment of communion makes us ſpeed worſe in our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſuits, even albeit the things deſired be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                  <p>In this and the two following verſes, Chriſt doth preſſe fruitfulneſs upon his diſciples, which formerly he had recommended as the effect of keeping of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and as a ſtrong motive to it. So that by theſe arguments he doth not only preſſe fruitfulneſſe in it ſelfe, but alſo doth more ſtrongly urge them to keep commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion with him, ſince fruitfulneſſe (which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable) cannot be attained without it. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preſſing fruitfulneſſe are three; whereof the firſt, is, that it honoureth God, and the ſecond (alſo in this verſe) that it evidenceth unto them, and confirmeth them in their good eſtate and high priviledge, of being his diſciples. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt abhorreth all pretences of keeping communion with him, which doth not appear in effects; for this end it is, that he is not content to preſſe abiding in him, unleſſe he preſſe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs alſo, as the true evidence thereof. 2. Such as would prove themſelves to hold communion with Chriſt, ought not to reſt ſatisfied with flowers and leaves of a profeſſion and external ſhewes, but muſt ſtudy for ſolid fruit and good works; for, he requireth <hi>fruit.</hi> 3. True members of Chriſt ought to abound with fruit, even all the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23, 24. (Not pleaſing themſelves with ſome few that they would cull out, neglecting others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. nor ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt after what may pleaſe or adorne themſelves, neglecting the really beſt things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31) And ſtudying chiefly to abound in theſe fruits, which the diſpenſations of the time and their own ſtations, in their ſeveral relations, call for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4 5.

                     </gap>e not themſelves abounding in fruits of duty Yet if they be ſenſible of their barrenneſſe, and it be matter of lamentation and humility that they are ſo, and that they do not keep communion with Chriſt to make it otherwiſe; if they ſeriouſly deſire fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in duty and under diſpenſations,; and do not reſt on any meaſure they have Chriſt will look on them as having much fruit, and they are bound to beleeve fruit, when they do not ſee it. 4 As Chriſt ſought his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory in all he did, ſo true beleevers, who keep communion with him, will be tender of, and dearly affected with Gods honour, and what may promove it; And will be aſhamed of ſelfe-ſeeking, or want of zeal for God, who by many favours hath proven himſelfe a Father, and purchaſed them that they may be for his glory; for, as this prevailed with Chriſt, ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it as a ſtrong argument to move his followers to ſtudy fruitfulneſſe, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified.</hi> 5. Fruitfulneſſe, eſpecially when we abound in it, (otherwiſe men may get through, who do not honour him as they ought) doth indeed honour God; As evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing his fulneſſe and fidelity to his own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14, 15. As begetting high thoughts of him in their hearts, who participate of this his bounty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14. And, as drawing in others to glorifie him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. for, however, ſome think they glorifie him by a naked profeſſion, and others are ſo preſumptuous, as to pretend to glorifie him by perſecuting his ſervants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5. yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit;</hi> So that they have need to look to it, who by their barrenneſſe would reproach him, as if he were a wilderneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. 6. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly ſoever men think of a relation to Chriſt, <hi>Joh</hi> 9.27, 28. Yet it is the high dignity of ſinful men to be diſciples to him; Therefore it is held out, as a ſweet encouragement, to be <hi>my diſciples.</hi> 7. Such as are diſciples indeed, will need dayly confirmations that they are ſo; And will look on it as a priviledge whereof they ought dayly to aſſure themſelves, and make evident to others that they have right to it, by ſubmitting to be taught by him, and following his directions daily: for this is the force alſo of the argument preſſing them to their duty, <hi>ye ſhall be my diſciples,</hi> that is, not made diſciples, for that goeth before fruitfulneſſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that they are ſuch indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31. and the world convinced of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. Which is in its own kinde as needful as to be a diſciple; for, they who are admitted to that priviledge cannot but daily feed upon it, and need daily confirmations of it; their good condition not permitting them to ſleep, but cheriſhing tenderneſſe in them. 8. Albeit our fruitfulneſſe do not merit heaven, nor be any cauſe of our good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Yet it is the way to happineſſe, and the infallible evidence of our good condition and eſtate; for, So (by bearing fruit) <hi>ſhall ye be my diſciples.</hi>

faireſt fruits of faith and communion with him; That love muſt be the root of wel-doing, and is never idle, but muſt be about obedience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. That the faith of his love to us cannot but beget love to him; That Chriſt delights to be loved by us, and therefore exhorts unto it; and, that he requireth conſtancy and continuance in this love, as, if it be ſincere, it will be conſtant. It is true, I ſay, theſe points are ſound, and ariſe from this exhortation and purpoſe annexed to it, ſo underſtood. And it is not ſit to reſtrict the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, where it may be taken largely; Yet the purpoſe and ſcope in this place, ſeemes chiefly, if not only, to lead us to underſtand it of his love toward us, in the aſſurance and ſenſe whereof we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and which we are to entertain by tender walking.

(To preſſe the point of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) He aſſureth them there was no way to abide in this love, but by tender walking, which he further confirme, from his own example, who by obedience did continue in his Fathers love, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It tends to the advantage and comfort of theſe who have fled to Chriſt, to know that he is dearly beloved of the Father, and therefore the Father cannot but be well pleaſed with them in him; Therefore doth he tell them, <hi>the Father hath loved me.</hi> 2. Chriſt, being beloved of the Father, is a ſtorehouſe to receive, and a conduit to conveigh that love to his people through him, as his aſſignes and members, and he doth himſelfe love them; for, <hi>the Father hath loved me, and I have loved you.</hi> 3 The love of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own is matchleſſe, and can be reſembled by no love on earth, but is like the Fathers love to him, as being eternal, ſincere and intimate, in comprehenſible infinite, and unchangable, as the other is; for, <hi>as the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you,</hi> compareth 10.15. 4. It is not enough, in Chriſts account, that he hath matchleſs love toward his own, unleſſe they alſo know of it, and he perſwade and aſſure their hearts thereof, notwithſtanding the ſenſe of their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs; and their miſtakes in meaſuring his love by themſelves, who are but ſhallow creatures; Therefore doth he take pains to aſſure them, that <hi>ſo have I loved you.</hi> 5. Such as are aſſured of the love of Chriſt, and are ſenſible of the matchleſneſſe thereof, will be moſt tender of entertaining the ſenſe of it, and for a world would not provoke him to withdraw it: Therefore, from the former intimation of his love, he inferreth, not only as their duty, but what will be their practice, if they ſtudy it rightly, <hi>continue ye in my love.</hi> And this he premits as a forcible motive to preſſe them to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.7. and 3.5.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts matchleſſe love to his people ought not to turn them idle, nor doth diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them from duty; But he hath impoſed a yoke upon them, which ſhould be ſweet becauſe impoſed by him; Therefore, with his love, he intimates that he hath ſervice for them, <hi>my commandments.</hi> 2. The ſenſe of Chriſts love begets a love to him, which will not be idle, but very laborious; for, to be beloved, and to <hi>keep his commandments,</hi> go together. See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. 3. As obedience is an evidence of our love to Chriſt, ſo it is the mean of keeping us in the ſenſe and aſſurance of his love to us, without which we are but deluded; for, <hi>If ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love.</hi> See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. 4. True fruitfulneſſe, and tender walking in the ſenſe of Chriſts love to us, muſt appear, not in ſervice of our own deviſing, but what he pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcribes; and in obeying the commands, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> out of fear only, but out of love to Chriſt; for, to <hi>bear much fruit,</hi> ver. 8. is here explained, to <hi>keep the commandments,</hi> and, <hi>my commandments.</hi> 5. Chriſt hath fully performed all that was enjoyned him to do, and ſuffer, as the ſurety of beleevers; for, in this he is a wonderful pattern and mirrour of obedience; <hi>I have kept my Fathers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 17 4. 6. Chriſt by his obedience to the Father doth continue in his love, and is not out of Court, but in a capacity to make ſinners welcome through him; for, ſaith he, <hi>I abide in his love.</hi> 7 Chriſt, in his great love to his people, hath eſſayed theſe duties and means of entertaining the love of God, which he preſcribes unto them; That ſo he may make their way eaſie by his going before them; may ſympathize with them in their hard ſervices, may engage them not to decline to follow ſuch a leader, or the way he took for attaining ſpecial favours; and, may by his perfection cover their infirmities, ſo that through him they may have that ſucceſſe which he himſelfe had: For theſe ends doth he urge their duty from his own example, <hi>even as I have kept my Fathers commandments, and abide in his love.</hi> And particularly, that they may not ſeek another way of entertaining the Fathers love, then he walked in, and that he may aſſure them, their weak endeavours through him ſhould keep them in the Fathers love, as he by his perfect obedience did abide in it. 8. Such as would entertain the love of God, ought to look on Chriſts example, not only as an engagement to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in general; But as a pattern to be imitated parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in what is imitable; And namely, in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſelfe-denial; his ſubmiſſion to the Fathers will, his meekneſſe in ſuffering, his cheerfulneſſe and delight to do the will of God; his univerſal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obedience, &amp;c. for, ſo much alſo is imported, that they ſhould <hi>keep the commandments, even as I kept,</hi> &amp;c. that the practice was not only an engagement, but a pattern to them.</p>

                  <p>This verſe contains the laſt particular in this part of the Chapter, wherein (by way of concluſion) Chriſt points out his ſcope in all this doctrine, (which alſo holds true of the whole Word of God as it is ſpoken to beleevers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8) For whereas by theſe many and preſſing exhortations, they might readily be diſcouraged, and miſtake him; Therefore he declareth that his aime in all this was to have his joy abiding in them, in a full and conſtant manner, and that therefore he had preſſed communion with himſelfe,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48148:163"/>
and fruitfulneſſe flowing there from, as the way to attain and entertain ſuch a mercy. And ſo it is a new argument to fruitfulneſſe, that ſo they may promove and ſecure their own true joy. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts dealing and ſpeaking to his people, may ſeem, oft-times, ſo contrary and croſſe to his great ſcope, as they will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily miſtake him, unleſſe himſelfe expound what he aims at; Therefore muſt he declare for what end he hath ſaid this, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that my joy may remain,</hi> &amp;c. as being a thing they could not well diſcern of themſelves. 2. Chriſt doth allow on his people joy and rejoycing, on his own tearmes, and in his order; for, this is his ſcope here, <hi>that my joy might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in you.</hi> 3. Beleevers, in laying hold on their priviledge of rejoycing, ought not to look on their worth of deſerving, but on his allowance, and what he hath purchaſed, and will conferre upon them; for, ſo much doth he intimate (as a part of the meaning) when he calls it, <hi>my joy,</hi> by way of purchaſe, allowance, and gift, and therefore <hi>your joy,</hi> by right. 4. Whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers may apprehend in Chriſts ſharp dealing and doctrine, or whatever be Chriſts neareſt end in it; Yet ultimately it tends to teſtifie his care of their welfare, and to further and advance their true joy; for, <hi>Theſe things</hi> (even preſſing exhortations to difficult duties, and ſharp threatnings, which could not but humble and exerciſe ſenſible ſouls; Even, <hi>theſe things) have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy may remain in you.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 28. 5. Albeit the joy of beleevers be Chriſts purchaſe and free gift; yet it is allowed upon none, but theſe who walk in the wayes of fruitfulneſſe and obedience, as an evidence of their good eſtate and intereſt in him; for, <hi>Theſe things,</hi> concerning fruitfulneſſe, tend to their joy; So that the joy of wilfully fruitleſſe ſouls is but deluſion, (albeit they who are humbled in the ſenſe of unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, may rejoyce in free grace offered in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.) and our lazineſſe is a great obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of our joy. 6. As beleevers will diſdain to rejoyce in any thing beneath Chriſt; So, albeit they do evidence their intereſt in joy by fruitfulneſs; Yet they will be far from rejoycing therein; Only it leads them up to rejoyce in him, who is the author of all, and with wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m they are aſſured they hold communion, by their fruitfulneſs; Therefore alſo unto fruitful diſciples, it is called <hi>my joy,</hi> namely, a joy in him, and not in their own fruitfulneſs, far leſſe in other carnal things. 7. Chriſt doth allow unto beleevers not only flaſhes and fits of joy, but a conſtant ſolide uninterrupted joy; for, his will is, that <hi>my joy remain in you,</hi> whereas the wickeds will wither. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. 8. If beleevers would make more conſcience of tender walking, and of conſtancy in fruitfulneſs, their joy would be more conſtant and leſs interrupted: for, fruitfulneſs, which he hath been preſſing, is the mean to attain this end, <hi>that my joy remain in you,</hi> whereas by barrenneſs they over-cloud their own good condition. 6. The joy of beleevers in Chriſt, is in it ſelf a full joy, needing no other carnal joy to be added with it, to fill the heart: being a joy that will bear out under all diſcouragements; and, a joy far different from the worldlings joy, which is full of heavineſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. for, ſo it is here called, a <hi>full joy.</hi> 10. Beleevers, within time, do never taſt ſo much of ſpiritual joy, but more is allowed, and more is to be expected in the way of tender and fruitful walking; for, his ſcope in exhorting to fruitfulneſs, is, <hi>That your joy might be full,</hi> yet fuller, not in regard of the object, but in their ſenſible enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. 11. Whatever be the ſmall meaſure of joy beleevers do enjoy, by reaſon of their fruitleſneſs, diffidence, diſcouragement, and ſtraitning in their own bowels, and how oft ſo ever that they have be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Yet it is Chriſts purpoſe and aime to have their joy conſtant and full, and he will not give over till it be ſo; for, his ultimate ſcope, in his dealing with them, and his doctrine to them, is, <hi>that your joy might be full,</hi> as it will be at laſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.23. And herein it differs from the joy of the wicked, which ends in heavineſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13.</p>

Compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 34. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt require that we ſtudy an univerſal obedience, and fruitfulneſs in all that he hath commanded; Yet it is his will, we be carried moſt toward theſe fruits which are moſt excellent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for this cauſe it is, that, having formerly preſſed fruitfulneſſe in general, he now deſcends to preſſe this one particular fruit. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31 — 2. The true touch-ſtone of our communion with Chriſt, and of fruitfulneſs in the duties of his ſervice, is, the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious performance of duties of the ſecond Table; Therefore doth he inſiſt ſo particularly in this duty of mutual love, as a mean to evidence the reality of their fruitfulneſs. 3. Of all duties to our neighbour, and, particularly, of one Saint to another, love is the moſt excellent, as being the ſumme of the law, the fountain of all other duties, and the mean of making beleevers uſeful each to other; Therefore, doth he require this in particular, <hi>that ye love one another.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. 4.

                  <p>That Chriſt may enforce this duty from his example, he doth commend his love to them (which they are to imitate) from ſeveral evidences thereof. Whereof the firſt (in this verſe) is, his laying down of his life for

them. Which being the greateſt evidence of friendſhip among men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7. doth ſet out the greatneſſe of his love to them; And that ſo much the more, as though they were friends in his purpoſe when he died for them, and were to be reconciled and brought into friendſhip by his death, yet they were then in themſelves enemies <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt will let no opportunity ſlip, whereby he may unfold his heart, and manifeſt ſomewhat of his love to his people; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in preſſing this duty of mutual love, he inſiſts on ſuch arguments as may not only preſſe it, but may alſo aggree with his principal drift in this Sermon, which is, to let out his tender heart unto them. 2. Such as would make right uſe of Chriſts love, ought to be much in the ſtudy thereof, and to know diſtinctly what it is; Therefore, doth he inſiſt to commend his love, that the example may be more binding. 3. Chriſts love to beleevers is ſo large, that we cannot comprehend or take it up, but in reſemblances and compariſons; Therefore muſt he ſet it out here by the ſhadow of the love of friends. 4. Chriſt did really lay down his life for, and in place of, his people; They ſtanding guilty before the Tribunal of divine juſtice, He, as their ſurety by the covenant of Redemption, was ſurrogate in their roome, their ſins being charged on him, and they ſet free; for, <hi>he laid down his life for his friends.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. 5. The benefit of Chriſts death is intended only for his friends, who are choſen of God, and given to him to be reconciled and made friends; for, he laid down his life <hi>for his friends,</hi> and them only. 6. Chriſts laying down his life for his people, is the cleareſt mirrour, wherein to read his love; for, he proveth that he had loved them, in that he <hi>laid down his life.</hi> 7. Chriſts love, in dying for his people, doth ſhine in this, that although they were enemies in themſelves; Yet he had a friendly reſpect to them, and did follow them, till he drew them into a covenant of friendſhip; for, this doth commend his love, that he <hi>laid down his life</hi> for them as <hi>friends,</hi> though they were enemies. 8. Chriſts love to his people is the moſt matchleſſe of loves, and eſſay whom we will, none will bid ſo much for us or our love, as he; Therefore doth he commend it as ſingular, <hi>greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> yet he had done this, and more alſo, in that he had done it before they were brought into actual friendſhip with him.</p>

                  <p>Before Chriſt proceed to another evidence of his love and friendſhip, he takes occaſion to apply this priviledge of his dying for his friends, to them, upon condition of their obedience: Hereby commending this his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as worthy that they ſhould aſſure themſelves of an intereſt in it, by friendly carriage and obedience on their part; which makes way for the exhortation to mutual love in particular, which he afterward reſumes. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts offers of friendſhip are never eſteemed of as they ought, unleſſe we be ſtirred up thereby to make ſure an intereſt therein, on right tearms; Therefore doth he take occaſion to urge them to make ſure of ſuch a priviledge. And indeed, even diſciples are not raſhly to lay hold on it, but upon ſure ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. There is a real friendſhip made up betwixt Chriſt and beleevers, conſiſting in an intimate conjunction and unity, harmony and aggreement in minde and will, ſympathy and fellow feeling, mutual delight in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of one another, communion in eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, &amp;c. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>ye are my friends.</hi> See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Sam</hi> 2.23. 3.

As friendſhip obligeth to obedience, ſo only friends to Chriſt can obey rightly; Friendſhip will carry them through the hardeſt of duties, and will make them cordial, cheerful, zealous, univerſal, and conſtant, in their obedience; for, in this reſpect, alſo, do theſe go together. 5. Albeit Chriſt will not over-drive his friends in his ſervice, yet his dominion over them is unlimited, and he will have them to decline nothing which he ſhall be pleaſed to enjoyne; for, they muſt do <hi>whatſoever</hi> he commandeth. 6. Obedience unto God is a true evidence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him; And they who, having fled to Chriſt, do yet keep themſelves in the poſture of ſervants, and are willing to do ſervice to him, he will eſteeme of them as friends; for, <hi>ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> See <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond evidence of Chriſts love, (and a reaſon why he changeth their ſtile from that of <hi>ſervants</hi> uſual to him before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.16. into that of <hi>friends</hi>) is, his communication of ſecrets and of his counſel with them, unto which no meere ſervant is admitted by his Maſter. For underſtanding of this, Conſider, 1. While he refuſeth to call them ſervants any more, but friends, it is not to be underſtood, as if they were hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to be exempted from obedience, or from being ſervants indeed; For in the former verſe, and <hi>v.</hi> 20. we have both name and thing of <hi>ſervants</hi> continued.

But the Diſciples were priviledged ſervants, who were admitted to know the counſel of God revealed to Chriſt. 3. While it is ſaid, that <hi>henceforth</hi> he changeth their title, it is not to be underſtood, as if they were not friends before; yea, he calls them ſo with an eye to their after ſufferings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4.

Only, it is not to be underſtood of that infinite treaſure of knowledge communicate from the Father to the Son, as God; But he ſpeaks here as the Prophet of the Church, ſent out to reveal all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whereof he kept nothing back. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Chriſts followers ought to be his ſervants, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created, and eſpeeially, as being redeemed by him, and becauſe of the many benefits conferred on them daily; yet by being ſervants, they are friends alſo, in regard of intimate communion and tender uſage; for, <hi>I call you not ſervants, but I have called you friends.</hi> 2. The dignity of beleevers is a growing dignity; ſo that the longer they follow Chriſt, they will know more of the high priviledges allowed by him upon them; for, this cauſe, ſaith he, <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but I have called you friends;</hi> and ſo after his reſurrection he goeth higher, and calleth them <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, John</hi> 20.17. 3. Chriſt hath many ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and proofs of his love abiding his people in a time of trial, which they will not get at another time; Therefore he reſerveth this ſweet ſtile till the time of their ſad trial by reaſon of his departure. And therefore it is given them before, when he ſpeaks of their ſufferings, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. 4. Chriſts love to his people is not diminiſhed by his bodily departure from them, but rather he thereby takes occaſion to let out more of it; Therefore alſo doth he chooſe to call them <hi>friends,</hi> now when he is to remove. 5. In ſo farre as beleevers liſt themſelves to be ſervants to Chriſt, they muſt ſtoop to be ignorant of what he pleaſeth not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal; and muſt bleſſe him that they know their duty, and ſhould go about it, not enquiring into the reaſons of it; for, this is the lot of ſervants, (though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be advanced to get more, when their Maſter pleaſeth, (<hi>A ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth.</hi> 6.

That his mercy had prevented them in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both eternall unto ſalvation, and their effectual calling as the effect thereof, as alſo unto the office of Apoſtleſhip. 2. That being choſen, he had appointed them to bring forth much and remaining fruit, in their private ſtations, and publike callings. 3. That for any thing they needed to enable them to be fruitful, they ſhould have acceſſe to the Father through him, for obtaining thereof. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as are true beleevers, and have indeed given up themſelves to Chriſt, to do him ſervice, ought and will have a ſingular eſtimation of Chriſt, preferring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting him in their hearts above all other things; for, <hi>ye have not choſen me,</hi> is not an abſolute denial, but, on the contrary, imports they had done ſo, only in reſpect of order he had choſen them before. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. 2. It is naturally incident to all men, to diſpute in their mindes againſt the freedome of Gods grace, and to be ambitious to have matter of boaſting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſee ſomewhat moving God to let out his love upon them; Therefore muſt Chriſt not only aſſert his chooſing of them, but remove any conceit of their chooſing him firſt; <hi>ye have not choſen me, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Whatever debate there be in this matter, yet our Lord is the preventer of all good in us, both by his eternal election, and by effectual vocation, as alſo by predeterminating concurrence and influence to every good work in particular; for, <hi>ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. 4. As no man may take any office to himſelf in Chriſts Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe both the office be appointed by him, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and called to it; ſo the reaſon why he calls any to do him ſervice in a particular office in his Church, is not any worth in them, but his own free grace, who furniſheth them and ſetteth them to work; for, this holds true alſo of their office; <hi>ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> 5. Such as God hath choſen to eternal life, and effectually called, are likewiſe ordained to ſerve Chriſt, and bring forth fruit to him, in their private ſtations, and publike emploiments; Therefore, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>and ordained you that ye ſhould bring forth fruit.</hi> 6. Such as Chriſt hath honoured with a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial charge in his houſe, ought not to loiter in it; nor to pleaſe themſelves with an high conceit of their own dignity and advancement: But it ſhould be their care to ſpend themſelves, in gaining ſouls, and bringing in fruit to Chriſt: for, this holds true of the Apoſtles in their calling in particular, <hi>I have choſen you, and ordained you that ye ſhould go and bring forth fruit.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. 7. Albeit beleevers, and Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be bound to their duty in their ſtations and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet their fruitfulneſſe depends not on their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but upon Chriſts commanded and appointed bleſſing; for, this, <hi>I have ordained,</hi> (or <hi>put,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you to go and bring forth fruit,</hi> imports not only that he had appointed them to endeavour fruitfulneſſe in the uſe of means, but that he had appointed fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to follow upon their endeavours. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 10.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48148:164"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. 8. The fruits of a mans carriage and calling which Chriſt approveth of, muſt be real and ſolid, not empty and evaniſhing; for, it is fruit that may <hi>remain.</hi> 9. The ſolid fruits which beleevers and Miniſters bring forth, ſhall not be loſt, but they will remain to Gods glory, and their own good, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming their faith and hope, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters in their calling, that they are approven of God in it; for, thus alſo their <hi>fruit remaineth,</hi> in its uſe and effect. 10. Whoſoever are faithfully ſtudying to be fruitful in their calling, and particularly, honeſt Miniſters, will finde many humbling wants in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for carrying through in it as becometh; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſubjoyned to the former, that they will be put to need prayer. 11. Such as truly diſcern their own inabilities and wants, will finde no help for them, but by prayer to God, nor any acceſſe to God in prayer, but through Chriſt; for, they will be put to <hi>ask the Father,</hi> and that, <hi>in my Name,</hi> ſaith he. 12. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Chriſts love to his people, that when he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptieth them, that they may be ſent to God through him, they ſhall not be diſappointed, but get a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, were their difficulties never ſo many, or ſo great; for, this is an evidence of his love, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my Name, he ſhall give it you.</hi> 13. Albeit it be only of free love, and through Chriſts merit, that the prayers of beleevers do finde acceſſe; yet their fruitfulneſſe is the way, wherein to come ſpeed; as evidencing their perſons to be reconciled, their condition to be good, and that they ſeek not things from God, to conſume on their luſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3. but to enable them to more fruitfulneſſe; for, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the former, <hi>that your fruit ſhould remain: that whatſoever ye ſhall ask, &amp;c. he may give it.</hi> Where fruitfulneſſe is commended as the way to come ſpeed, and yet no merit to be placed in it, but the ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put up in Chriſts Name.</p>

The duty of mutual love is very comprehenſive, and containeth many duties in the boſome of it, to which love will ſtoop and condeſcend; Therefore Chriſt exhorts to it, as to many duties; <hi>Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another.</hi> See <hi>Rom,</hi> 13.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6, 7.</p>

                  <p>Followeth the third and laſt part of the chapter, wherein Chriſt, that he may yet more excite them to mutual love, doth forewarn them of the hatred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution they were to meet with in the world; and armeth them againſt the ſame by ſeveral arguments of conſolation and encouragement, to <hi>v.</hi> 22. Which in the following purpoſe he further confirmeth, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates them againſt all ſtumbling blocks and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe their caſe is intimate that the world would hate them; unto which is ſubjoyned the firſt argument of encouragement, taken from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and lot, ſo aſſuring them that in their ſufferings, they had fellowſhip with him, who was hated of the world before them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As beleevers may look for love from Chriſt and Saints, ſo they muſt expect trouble and hatred from the world; for, unto the former doctrine, concerning Chriſts love, and their duty to love one another, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>that the world will hate you.</hi> 2. The worlds hatted of beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is a ſtrong argument to perſwade them to love one another; for, this is alſo ſubjoyned as an argument to preſſe mutual love, that they are ſure to meet with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from others. And indeed, when love decayeth, God uſeth to kindle it up by ſtormes of perſecution, which cauſe Saints to draw together. 3. Chriſt is a faithful Maſter, who will hide from his ſervants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their danger and difficulties; and it may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of the reality of his encouragements, that he giveth ſo free warning of dangers: Therefore, doth he faithfully warn them here. 4. Perſecution ariſeth from mens worldly diſpoſitions, and their being of the world; and all who are ſo, are fair to be cruel perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as they have opportunity; for, <hi>the world hates you,</hi> ſaith he. 5. As the perſecution of Saints floweth from implacable malice in the world againſt them: ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do hate godlineſſe, and the godly for its ſake, they are already engaged in a courſe of perſecution, and will go a further length, as they have permiſſion and opportunity; for this cauſe doth he comprehend all their perſecutions and ſufferings under the name of <hi>hatred,</hi> as being a perſecution in Gods account, and the riſe of all the worlds cruelty. 6. Hatred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution from the world, is a very hard and difficult lot to Saints, unleſſe Chriſt do encourage them againſt and under it; Therefore doth he not only forewarn, but arme them alſo. 7. Such as would bear out under ſad lots, ought to be well acquainted and ſtudie ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the condition of Chriſt and his Church in all ages; and what they know, Chriſt will put them to it, to emprove it; Therefore, doth he appeal to their knowledge in this matter of their encouragement, <hi>ye know, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Chriſt is the prime object of the worlds hatred, and they who hate his members, do hate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt, and them, becauſe of ſomewhat of him in them; for, ſaith he, <hi>it hated me, before it hated you.</hi> 9. As it is a great encouragement in ſuffering times, to know that beleevers before us have met with the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48148:165"/>
like lots, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. So, in particular, Chriſts going before us in enduring the worlds hatred, may exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly encourage ſufferers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. For, hereby not only is his great love commended, who would offer himſelf to an ingrate world, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. But it ſerves further, to guard our hearts againſt the calumnies caſt upon us in our ſufferings, ſince he, who was innocent, and the Lord of glory, was perſecuted under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Samaritane, and what not? To point out our dignity, that we ſhould be made conforme to our Head, were it but in ſuffering, and that we ſhould be ſerved heires to that enmity that began at him, and which lights on us for his ſake: To aſſure us of his ſympathy, in whoſe quarrel we are embarqued, and who drank of that cup himſelf: To aſſure us how eaſie this ſuffering will be, he having eſſayed it before us, (as nothing will prove hard to a beleever which Chriſt hath once taſted of) ſo that we need no more but to follow him to the ſpoile; and, to aſſure us of the victory, ſince he hath already triumphed over the worlds hatred in our name. So much is held forth, for the comfort of ſufferers, in this Argument, <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The ſecond argument of conſolation is taken from what their ſuffering from the world may evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto them; Namely, that they are not of the world, but cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of it, and therefore the world hates them; whereas if it were otherwiſe with them, the world would love his own. So the force of the Argument, is, partly, that they behoved to make for trouble, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inevitable, conſidering they are not of the world; and partly, their ſuffering from the world was ſo clear an evidence of their good condition, that they ought not to be diſcouraged at it. What Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>the world would love his own,</hi> doth not contradict the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experiences of wars, contentions and emulations, among men of the world. For, 1. If we compare the hatred they carry toward their own, with what they have againſt the godly, it is nothing ſo violent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream. 2. They diſter not in contrary general principles and ends, but only in contrary luſts, and when the intereſt of one interferes with another, and croſſeth it. 3. They do eaſily agree in hating the godly, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> did. 4. Albeit ſome wicked men hate ſome wickedneſſe, yet it is not a pure hatred, but for their own corrupt ends. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There are in this world two ſeeds, who ſtand in oppoſition one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betwixt whom there is a conſpicuous differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for, there are ſome <hi>of the world,</hi> and ſome <hi>not of the world</hi> 2. The difference betwixt the godly and the world is not of the godlies making, but doth ſlow from Gods free grace; for, <hi>ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world,</hi> by eternal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and actual vocation, whereby they are made not to be conforme to this world, in judgement, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and practice. 3. Chriſt by his free grace can make a great change in men, and make excellent veſſels out of the vileſt matter; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have choſen you,</hi> to all this dignity and excellent condition, <hi>out of the world.</hi> 4. Saints, being ſeparate from the world, and their courſes, muſt expect to be hated by the world, upon that very account; and that becauſe the world hates God and his image in them, and they cannot endure to be condemned by the light that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the godly; for, <hi>becauſe I have choſen you out of the world, therefore doth the world hate you.</hi> 5. As the world do keep up their love from the godly, ſo their love will be little worth to a right diſcerner; when he conſidereth that to be beloved of the world is but an ill token, and evidenceth that either the perſon beloved is of their own ſtamp, or, at leaſt, complieth too much with their evil faſhions; therefore, doth he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this from the contrary, <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own.</hi> 6. As evidences of our Regeneration are worthy to be ſought after, at any rate; ſo in particular, it may ſweeten the worlds ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Saints, when they conſider that the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſincerely love what is good: And therefore their hating of them for good, is a real confirmation of their good eſtate; for, this is the encouragement, that <hi>the world hateth you, becauſe I have choſen you out of the world.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third Argument of conſolation (amplifying and enlarging the firſt, and wherein he expounds that <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, v.</hi> 18. to comprehend both perſecution of their perſon, and contempt of their doctrine) is taken from the inevitableneſſe of trouble, conſidering their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, as ſervants to their Maſter; and the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in this, that they ſhould be no better intreated then he was, both in their perſon and Miniſtry. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts words are not ſpoken at randome, but to good purpoſe, and may, long after they are heard, ſerve us in much ſtead; Therefore doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them <hi>to the word that he ſaid unto them, Matth.</hi> 10.24. <hi>John</hi> 13.16. 2. The Word of God, rightly emproven, is a ſpecial mean of patience and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement under ſufferings; Therefore doth he ſend them to it. 3. As we ought not to ſleight the Word, but lay it up as we hear it; ſo in an houre of tentation and trouble, we ought to remember on what we have heard, as being ſpoken for our uſe in ſuch caſes: Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Remember the word that I ſaid unto you,</hi> when they are to reſolve on troubles. 4. Of all that we hear, nothing is ſo effectual to arme us with patience, and encourage us under troubles, as to be much acquainted with Chriſt, his uſage in the world, and his deportment under it; Therefore doth he, in particular, call to remembrance, what he had ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſuffering, who was their Maſter. 5. Chriſts ſervants cannot in reaſon expect better entertainment
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48148:165"/>
then he found in the world; for, he mentions his ſufferings, that they may cloſe with that truth, <hi>The ſervant is not greater then the Lord,</hi> which, as before, it preached humility, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.16. ſo here, patience and ſubmiſſion. 6. Such as have a ſow eſteem of themſelves, and an high eſteem of Chriſt, who yet ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer more then they are put to, will eaſily be brought to ſtoop, and be patient in trouble; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he propound the compariſon under the termes of <hi>ſervant</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> that thoughts of the one and the other may perſwade them to ſubmit, and not think it ſtrange, that <hi>if they have perſecuted me, they alſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, &amp;c.</hi> 7. Hatred againſt Chriſt and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will reſolve in cruelty againſt their perſons as there is opportunity: for, ſo doth he explain it, <hi>They perſecuted me, and will perſecute you.</hi> 8. As contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of doctrine in the mouth of faithful meſſengers, are upon their way to perſecute their perſons: ſo alſo their very contempt is a moſt cruel perſecution in Chriſts account, and in the account of godly Miniſters, who cannot but be ſadly afflicted with the ill ſucceſſe of their Miniſtery; for both theſe cauſes, it is added to the perſecuting of their perſons, <hi>If they have kept my ſaying, they will keep yours alſo,</hi> that is, they will keep the one no better then they did the other. 9. Whatever pretence of reſpect men may have to the Word, yet they are but real deſpiſers thereof, ſo long as they do not lay it up as a treaſure in their heart, and obſerve it in their practice; for, this is it he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that they <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>ſaying.</hi> 10. It is the great advantage of beleevers, that Chriſt and they have the ſame common friends and enemies, and are embarqued together in ſufferings; therefore doth he parallel their caſe with his, <hi>If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you, if they have kept my ſaying, they will keep yours alſo.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth Argument of conſolation is taken from the goodneſſe of the cauſe of their ſufferings, as being for his Names ſake. Which is further amplified from the cauſe of the worlds violence on that quarrel; to wit, their ignorance of God who ſent him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the wiſe contrivance of the myſtery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The godly, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, faithful Miniſters ought to expect trial from the world, in great multiplicity and variety; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>All theſe things will they do unto you,</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly to that oppoſition both againſt their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 2. It is the duty of beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and particularly, of faithful Miniſters, to own and avow the Name of Chriſt, his truth and glory, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befal them; for, their ſuffering <hi>for his Names ſake,</hi> importeth that they ſtand for it. 3. The great quarrel of the world againſt beleevers, is, for the Name of Chriſt; And as when the world was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, this quarrel was avowed: ſo however now ſome other thing be pretended, yet it is the quarrel ſtill; for, <hi>All theſe things will they do unto you for my Names ſake.</hi> 4.

                  <p>Becauſe the former Arguments of conſolation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſomewhat at which his weak followers might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily offend; As namely, That Chriſt ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and hated in the world, yea, and ſo hated, as they his followers ſhould be hated for his ſake, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſubjoynes other Arguments to encourage them, by obviating all ſcandal which might be taken at the cauſe of their ſuffering, and his being hated in the world. The firſt argument is taken from the miſerable condition of perſecutors, which their hating of him did evidence. This is proſecute in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aggravations of their ſin who did ſo: In the firſt whereof (in this verſe) is declared. That however their ignorance, <hi>v.</hi> 21. might ſeem to plead for them; yet his preſence and doctrine did take away all excuſes and pretexts; did prove them to hate him out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable malice; and, did ſo aggravate their guilt, that it had otherwiſe been nothing, in reſpect of what it is now. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The conſideration of the great ſin of perſecutors may encourage the godly, and guard their heart under ſuffering; as being an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God approveth of them and their quarrel, when he is ſo diſpleaſed with theſe who oppoſe them; and that they cannot take them to the other ſide, but they muſt make God their party; for, this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſolation, taken from the aggravation of the ſin of perſecutors. 2. As the preſence and doctrine of Chriſt in the world, is the greateſt of mercies offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it; ſo it is a ſad caſe, when that mercy is by men turned into a plague, and matter of dittay againſt themſelves; as here, his <hi>coming,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking unto them,</hi> was an occaſion to render them inexcuſable, 3. Albeit all men, even theſe who live without the written Word, be guilty of ſin, both original and actual; yet ſins againſt the Goſpel, and of theſe who hear it, are of ſo deep a dye, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond argument of conſolation, obviating the ſcandal of his being hated in the world, is taken from the prediction thereof in Scripture.

The eying of God, and his decree and providence about hard lots, is a mean to make them more eaſie, and leſſe ſtumbled at; for hereby we are encouraged to beleeve that there is more in them, then we can ſee, and that nothing cometh to paſſe without him: Therefore doth he guard againſt their ſtumbling at his lot, by pointing out a decree and providence in it, intimate long age. 2.

of the Old Teſtament, to think, ſpeak, and ſing of him; for, by many citations applyed to him, it is apparent he hath been much in their minde. 6.

It evidenceth the worlds malice againſt Chriſt and his followers, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency cannot ſhelter them from their cruelty; And it is Chriſt and his peoples encouragement, that their malice and cruelty is cauſeleſſe; for, ſo much is imported in the Scripture cited, as it relates to <hi>David</hi> and Chriſt both, <hi>They hated me without a cauſe.</hi> See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109.4.</p>

And they themſelves ſhould be enabled to bear witneſs concerning him, having been with him from the beginning. As for the conjunction of the Spirits witneſſing and theirs, it is thus to be underſtood; That the Spirit being poured out on them, ſhould enable them to bear witneſſe of him, and ſhould be aſſiſting to them therein; partly, by his extraordinary work upon themſelves, and the miraculous works accompanying their doctrine; and, partly, by accompanying their teſtimony with conviction upon many, and with his inward ſeal upon the hearts of beleevers.</p>

The great doctrine of the Goſpel, is, to hold out Chriſt, what he is, that men do not miſtake or calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate him, but may embrace and beleeve in him; for, in this, all theſe witneſſes muſt concurre, <hi>to teſtifie of me.</hi> 3. The doctrine of the Goſpel, concerning Chriſt, is ſo great a myſtery, that it is very hardly beleeved and received in the world; for, ſo much is imported in that there muſt be ſo many witneſſe.

The Spirit of the Lord did ſufficiently vindicate Chriſts glory, and confirme the truth of the Goſpel, by his miraculous operations in the primitive times; for, by this mean, was Chriſt teſtified of, and to this doth Chriſt remit his diſciples for their encouragement. 6. Not only did the Spirit afford ſufficient matter of confirmation and conviction, in theſe his extraordinary operations, but where he pleaſeth to carry theſe in on hearts, he will either make men ſavingly acknowledge the excellency of a deſpiſed Chriſt, or, at leaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them thereof; for, this prediction, <hi>He ſhall teſtifie of me,</hi> imports, not only that he ſhall afford ſufficient matter of teſtimony, but, that eventually alſo it ſhould be, one way or other, effectual on many.</p>

It may confirme our faith in embracing the Apoſtles teſtimony of Chriſt, that what they delivered concerning him, they were eye and ear witneſſes thereof, and they intended not to deceive us; as may appear from the nature of their doctrine, ſo croſſe to our humours; by their not ſeeking their own eaſe or intereſt in preaching it; by not going into corners with their teſtimony, but avowing openly what was openly done, none daring refute them; and, by their harmony among themſelves; for, they are ſit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>becauſe ye have been with me from the beginning.</hi> See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.

The Chapter may be taken up in four principal parts: In the firſt whereof, Chriſt further proſecutes that purpoſe begun in the former Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſufferings: Wherein, he intimateth his ſcope in foretelling thereof, <hi>v. 1.</hi> expreſſeth more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly what ſufferings they were to meet with, <hi>v. 2.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth grounds of encouragement under ſuch a lot, <hi>v. 3, 4</hi> — and giveth a reaſon why he did no ſooner give them this diſtinct warning, <hi>v. — 4.</hi> In the ſecond part of the Chapter he again intimateth his departure: reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their abuſe of this warning, <hi>v. 5, 6.</hi> And encourageth them againſt the bitterneſs of this lot, <hi>1.</hi> By the promiſe of the holy Spirit, who would not come, but on his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>v. 7.</hi> and who, being come, would convince the world, <hi>v. 8, 9, 10, 11.</hi> inſtruct them, <hi>v. 12, 13.</hi> and glorifie him, by what he ſhould communicate of and from him, who is one and equal with the Father, <hi>v, 14, 15. 2.</hi> By a promiſe, that however he was ſhortly to be removed, yet they ſhould ſhortly after that, ſee him again: which is propounded, <hi>v. 16.</hi> and (by occaſion of the diſciples doubtfulneſs, <hi>v. 17, 18.</hi>) is more fully explained, <hi>v. 19, 20, 21, 22. 3.</hi> By a promiſe of their increaſe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and <hi>(4.)</hi> of ſucceſſe in their prayers put up in his name: both which are propounded, <hi>v. 23.</hi> and further amplified and enlarged, <hi>v. 24, 25, 26 27, 28.</hi> In the third part of the Chapter, The diſciples making a fair profeſſion of their proficiency by his former doctrine, <hi>v. 29, 30.</hi> their preſumption herein is checked, and they forewarned of their ſcattering and deſerting of him, <hi>v. 31, 32.</hi> The laſt part of the Chapter containeth the concluſion of the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, pointing out his ſcope in all of it, <hi>v. 33.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt part of the Chapter, Chriſt proſecutes his former doctrine concerning his diſciples ſufferings, in four particulars. In the firſt whereof (in this verſe) he points out what he aimed at in intimating and foretell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this their hard lot; Namely, that by this warning they might be ſo armed, and ſo fortified by the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements ſubjoyned, as not to ſtumble at it, when it came to paſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his people at randome, but what he hath well digeſted as needful for them, and which they ſhould accordingly ponder and eſteeme of; Therefore doth he ſhortly reſume what he had ſpoken, as being of much importance, and ſeriouſly to be thought upon by them. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you.</hi> 2. It is not enough to conſider what Chriſt ſaith, unleſſe alſo we take notice of his ſcope in ſpeaking of it; which oft-times we are ready to miſtake, unleſs he reveal it. Therefore, whereas they might be ready to ſink in ſorrow upon this intimation, he muſt tell them he hath another ſcope in it, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not be offended.</hi> 3. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee many things concerning Chriſts perſon, doctrine, way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. occurre as ſtumbling blocks in the way of profeſſours, to make them fall and turn out of the way; And particularly, affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ctions and perſecutions accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying Chriſt and the Goſpel, are grievous ſtumbling blocks, and do prove a neck break to many: for, it is here ſuppoſed, that by reaſon of this lot they will be ready to <hi>be offended,</hi> or, ſtumbled and ſcandalized, to divert them from good, &amp; tempt them to make apoſtaſie. 4. Afflictions and perſecutions are ſo ſearching, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that even the beſt have need to be guarded againſt the ſcandal thereof; for, even diſciples have need to be ſpoken unto, that they <hi>be not offended.</hi> 5. How ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ever tentations and prejudices may ſeem to plead for ſtumbling at Chriſt, in a day of trial; Yet it is moſt neceſſary that profeſſours do not ſtumble; ſeeing there is no ſafe retreat without a neck-break; Therefore doth he propound it, as a neceſſary duty, that however mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go, they <hi>be not offended.</hi> 6. Whatever ſtumbling blocks be laid in the way of profeſſours, and how many ſoever do ſtumble and fall upon them; Yet there are, ſufficient means to prevent their ſtumbling, and to convince them that there is no juſt cauſe, why they ſhould offend; for, here he intimateth, that he had taken ſufficient courſe, <hi>that they ſhould not be offended.</hi> 7. The Word of Chriſt (and particularly, his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the croſſe, and encouragements againſt the ſame) is a ſufficient guard againſt offences and ſcandals at the croſſe; For, 1. His intimation warneth men of their danger, ſo that they have themſelves to blame, if they be not armed with reſolution, but ſtill promiſe great things to themſelves. And it doth aſſure belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that he hath an eternal purpoſe and effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about theſe things which he can foretell before they come to paſſe. 2. He guardeth this intimation with ſo many encouragements and antidotes in the Word, as it cannot prove deadly to them that emprove the ſame. 3. The Word rightly emproven, doth purge out idols and luſts, which tempt men to ſtumble; doth direct their way in dark caſes, that they may not ſtumble; and, doth afford ſuch confirmations of faith, as may ſupport their hearts under trouble, and ſuch intimations of the ſeverity of God, as may deterre them from apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Theſe things</hi> (both of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and encouragement mentioned in the former Chapter) <hi>have I ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</hi> Not only was this the ſcope of his doctrine and intimation, but theſe were a ſufficient mean to prevent their ſtumbling, however they not emproving the ſame, were offended for a time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31.</p>

what ſufferings they were to meet with, not naming every particular kinde of ſuffering, but inſtancing in two of the ſaddeſt kindes thereof, which may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the reſt, as inferiour thereunto. One, of ſpiritual cenſures of the Church, of which excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is the ſaddeſt: The other, of bodily ſufferings, whereof a violent death is the ſharpeſt. Both theſe he warnes them of, foretelling that they may look for excommunication from the Jewes as a Church (of which ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.34. and 12.42.) and for violent deaths from them or others, in a tumultuous way, or from civil authority abuſing their powers. Yea, and that they may look, in their ſaddeſt ſufferings, to be laden with reproach, their perſecutors, through blind zeal thinking it acceptable ſervice, and a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice to God, to put them to death. In ſpeaking of excommunication and death, he ſubjoynes death to the former, as ſadder then it; Not becauſe it is ſimply ſadder to dye, then to be cut off from the ſociety and priviledges of Gods people (if their excommunication had been ſuch) But becauſe in this caſe their excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was unjuſt, and therefore the leſſe to be regarded. And albeit they did ſuffer death alſo unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Yet it was more ſharp, in reſpect that death is naturally bitter to men, and becauſe that by death, they were cut off from doing ſervice to their Maſter, whereas they might go on in their work, notwithſtanding the ſentence of excommunication. For it is further to be conſidered, That (beſide that this ſentence was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unjuſt, in regard of the cauſe, being for preaching in the name of Chriſt) the Jewes after their rejecting of the offer of Chriſt, that was firſt to be made unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. did become no Church, and ſo had no power of Church-cenſures, and conſequently, any they inflicted were nul in themſelves. And however they had continued a Church, yet the Apoſtles being general officers, they were above the reach of any particular Church power. And conſequently, however ſuch a ſentence might now affright them to think of it when they were rude and ignorant, and afterward it might be ſome tryal, in ſo far as it did render them odious and ſuſpected to them who could not diſcern aright, and ſo put ſome ſtop to the ſucceſſe of their Miniſtry: Yet the ſentence being null, they might warrantably go on; Yet not at all leading a preparative to any particular Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to contemne the ſentences of a true Church; upon their own alleagance of the corruption thereof, and of the injuſtice of the cauſe of the ſentence, as may be cleared from what is ſaid. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As perſecution and the croſſe do uſually accompany Chriſt and his followers; So general reſolutions for afflictions are not of any worth, unleſſe men alſo lay their accompt, and reſolve on what in particular they may meet with; Therefore doth he warne them particularly what they may expect, that they may accordingly be reſolved. 2. Such followers of Chriſt as would be armed indeed, ought to reſolve that they will meet with, not one, but many trials, of all ſorts; and that they may be eſſayed with the utmoſt violence, that mens malice can invent, or their power in Church or State can reach, either in an orderly, or tumultuous way; Therefore doth forewarne them of variety of particular trials, and that in the greateſt extremity. 3. A fixed reſolution, through the power of Chriſts grace, may carry a Saint through the greateſt difficulties he can meet with; for, all theſe are propounded as things they may g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Followers of Chriſt may lay their account, not only to be perſecuted by Pagans, or openly prophane men; but even by Church-members, yea, and Church-guides or they who pretend to be ſo; for, whereas he had f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>retold them of the worlds hatred, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.18. Now he explains it, that even they who have power to <hi>put out of Synagogues,</hi> would be againſt them. 5. Albeit a Church cenſure, unjuſtly inflicted, and by them who are no Church, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> have no ſuch power, be of no weight before God, yet it is an afliction, requiring much reſolution in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that perſecutors account themſelves not only a Church, but the only true Church; yea, and are very eminent in power in it; and do account Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followers, not worthy to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ome in it, but that they ought to be excommunicate, for in this reſpect he propounds it as a tryal to be digeſted by them, <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues.</hi> 6. When followers of Chriſt have taſted of leſſer ſufferings, they are not to ſit down there, but to lay their account that they may meet yet with ſadder, and by bearing leſſer troubles, they are to prepare themſelves for greater; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne a violent death, as a trial to be expected after they are excommunicate. 7. The conſideration of ſadder ſufferings which Saints have endured, and our ſelves may meet with, ought to ſweeten leſſer trials, and make us digeſt them with the greater moderation, and will do ſo, if we be preparing as we ought, for theſe ſad things; Therefore doth he teach them to ſwallow up the thoughts of excommunication, with apprehending what ſadder things they ſhould make ready for. <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea</hi> (or, <hi>but) the time cometh that they ſhall kill you.</hi> 8. As no extremity of torment can juſtifie men in denying Chriſt and his truth, nor will prevail with them who love and cleave to him, to do ſo; So followers of Chriſt ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe no meaſure of ſufferings for themſelves to endure, leſſe then a violent death it ſelfe, for Chriſts cauſe: Therefore doth he require that they have a reſolution even to be killed in this quarrel, <hi>whoſoever killeth you.</hi> 9. Death it ſelfe were eaſie to be digeſted by Saints if ſo be the quarrel and their integrity were clearly owned; But they muſt reſolve to have ſhame and ignominy accompanying their croſſe, to be buried under ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and calumnies, as if they were malefactours, and their cauſe to be traduced, as unjuſt, odious, ſeditious, &amp;c. for, this is the bitter ſting of their ſuffering, that perſecutors pretend they are for God, even in perſecuting them, <hi>whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. 10. Corrupt and erroneous men may have much blinde zeal in their falſe way, which is very furious and violent, and the cauſe of much cruelty and blood-ſhed againſt true profeſſours; for, from this zeal doth their cruelty flow, <hi>whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> 11. It will never juſtifie mens actions, that they have good intentions in them, or do follow their blinded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and zeal; But they may groſſely erre under theſe pretexts, unleſſe what they do be warranted by the Word; for, they had all theſe pretences who killed the Apoſtles, <hi>who ſo ever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi>

                  <p>In the third place, he ſubjoyneth two lenitives and encouragements to ſweeten this hard lot, and make them digeſt it: The firſt (in this verſe) is taken from the Original &amp; cauſe of perſecutors malice; which is their ignorance of the Father and him; Of which <hi>chap.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Perſecutors of Gods children, as taking no notice who they are, do bewray their ignorance of God and Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt in ſo far as they perſecute, were they never ſo good otherwiſe; for, <hi>and theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me.</hi> 2. Men who are, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ignorant of God and Chriſt, are in hazard to turne perſecutors, if they have the tentation; for, this being the cauſe of perſecution, it is no wonder the effect follow upon it. 3. Albeit it be in it ſelfe a ſad caſe, that ſo many men pretending to be for God, ſhould yet be ignorant of him and his Son; yet it ſhould ſweeten the ſad cup of ſufferers, that they know their perſecutors are ſo ignorant; for, the quarrel may comfort them, they need not fear them who are not approven of God; and, if he be not known, they ſhould not take it ill, if they be not acknowledged for what they are, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. therefore doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, by letting them ſee this ignorance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The next lenitive and encouragement (in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this verſe) is, that this prediction ſhould be uſeful and comfortable to remember it, when it came to be accompliſhed. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As, much is heard by Gods people, whereof they reap little profit, till affliction bring them to remember it; ſo, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, afflictions will bring the doctrine of the croſſe to remembrance; for, <hi>when the time ſhall come, you may remember that I told you.</hi> 2.

However predictions of trouble by Chriſt may be ready to ſadden the hearts of Saints: yet the prediction being compared with the event, and the remembrance thereof when it comes to paſſe, is very comfortable: The prediction thereof before hand, ſerving to acquaint us therewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come, that we may be diſpoſed for it, by a voluntary reſolution, and patience: ſerving alſo to prove him to be the Omniſcient God, and that he hath a providence in our troubles, and is not an idle ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour thereof; And the certainty of his predictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verified in the matter of trials, may aſſure us of the certainty of what he foretels concerning our deliverance, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.14, 15. Therefore is this given them as an encouragement; <hi>But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth and laſt place (in the end of the verſe) Chriſt having told the uſefulneſſe of foretelling this now, doth obviate an objection, and give a reaſon why he gave warning no ſooner. Namely, becauſe he was with them, and ſo, as they were tender and weak, needing his bodily preſence; ſo, he was the great Butt of mens malice in that time, and they lurked ſafely under his ſhadow. Albeit Chriſt had formerly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that diſciples behoved to take up their croſſe, &amp; had told them much of their hard lots, when he gave them their firſt Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. yet he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things I ſaid not to you at the beginning.</hi> Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a while with him, even before he had ſaid ſo much to them, and before they were called to the Apoſtleſhip; nor yet only becauſe he gave them now, <hi>v.</hi> 2. a more diſtinct and particular intimation of the kinde and degrees of their ſuffering, then at any time formerly. But, chiefly, what he formerly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told at a diſtance, he now foretels as things they were ſhortly after his removal to be eſſayed with. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt is a prudent and tender guider of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and knoweth the fit ſeaſons of tender uſage, of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral intimations of troubles at diſtance, of putting them in minde to make for approaching trouble, and of laying the croſſe actually on; for, ſo much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, in his not telling his diſciples at the firſt, what he now tell them; and they afterward met with. 2. His not telling his diſciples <hi>theſe things at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe he was with them,</hi> may ſerve to teach us, in all ages. 1. Chriſt is ſo tender of his followers weakneſſe, that he will not put them to hard eſſayes till they be confirmed, and trained, and fitted for them; Therefore did he at firſt ſtay with them as a Tutour and Safeguard, and trained them up with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufferings endured in his perſon, till they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were confirmed; See <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.16, 17. ſo that when Chriſt puts Saints to trials, they may reckon they are fitted for them, unleſſe they have neglected the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or do for preſent caſt away their confidence. 2. Chriſts preſence is the only ſweet ſhelter and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard againſt troubles and ſtormes; for, as he gave them an eaſie life while he was with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15. ſo, in all caſes, his ſpiritual preſence will arme ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently againſt trouble, if not to prevent it, yet to take the ſting out of it. 3. It may encourage Saints in their ſufferings, that Chriſt is the great object of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors malice, and they for his ſake. So that if they could reach him, they would not care for them; for, ſo much appeareth, in that while he was with them, they had no preſent uſe for the doctrine of ſufferings, as any way like to fall on them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. When Chriſt hath trained his people, till their ſtrength grow up, they may expect that after his ſweet preſence and ſenſible conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, they will meet with a ſtorme; for, now he tells them of that as near approaching, which he ſaid not at the beginning. 4. Saints, after long ſparing, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their trials will come thick and threefold upon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48148:168"/>
them, and that their being under one trial will not be a ſhelter to hide them from another; for, now he is not to be with them, which was a trial ſad enough, and they are to make for other ſad ſufferings, at the ſame time. 5. The Lord may ſo order, as to ſend afflictions on his people, when they ſeem to be worſe provided for them, and yet they ſhall be better borne through, then if it had been otherwiſe; for, it might ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable to them, to tryſt their trials with the time when they ſhould want his bodily preſence, and yet he made them in a better condition, when deprived of his bodily preſence, and having trials, then when enjoying it and wanting trials; as the event did prove.</p>

                  <p>Followeth, to <hi>v.</hi> 29. the ſecond part of the chapter, wherein, Chriſt by ſeveral encouragements, comforts them againſt his departure. Unto which, in theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he premits, 1. The repeated intimation of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to him that ſent him. 2. A reprehenſion of their not making uſe of, but rather abuſing this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in that they did ſo give up themſelves to ſorrow at the newes, as they neglected the opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves concerning his departure, and whither he went, which might have been of ſpecial uſe to them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The ſenſible and ſweet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Saints are not permanent, but ſubject to changes while they are within time; for, <hi>I was with you, v.</hi> 4 <hi>But now I go my way.</hi> 2. Whatever violence was uſed toward Chriſt, in his removal out of the world; yet his departure was voluntary in his own due time, after he had done his work, and not till then; for, ſaith he, <hi>I go my way,</hi> and that, <hi>now,</hi> having done my work, and not till now. 3. Chriſt and his followers never want ſufficient conſiderations to beautifie and ſweeten their ſaddeſt lots, and to ſwallow up the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof; Therefore doth he point out his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in lovely colours, <hi>I go my way to him that ſent me,</hi> which takes in the whole paſſages of his removal, in his death, burial, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And this was a moſt comfortable ſight of it, both to himſelf, who after his toile, was to triumph with his father, and to them who were hereby taught, that he had finiſhed his work, and was to be exalted for their good and behoof. 4. As men ought not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake employments, unleſſe they be ſent of God to do them; ſo they who are entruſted by him, muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain appear before him, to give an account of their truſt, and to be rewarded by him, if they have been faithful; for, herein Chriſt is our pattern, who being <hi>ſent</hi> of the Father, doth <hi>now go his way to him that ſent him,</hi> to give an account of his commiſſion, and to be glorified with him. 5. It is a ſweet conſideration to theſe who are exerciſed about the abſence of Chriſt, to know where he is, and whither he is gone, that ſo they may know where to finde him, what to do in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and, what advantage they may reap by his exaltation; for, he propounds this as the great and needful caſe to be reſolved, <hi>Whither goeſt thou?</hi> 6. It is our great fault, that we can reckon ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, wherein the advantage lay, <hi>whither goeſt thou?</hi> 7. It is not enough to look upon our ſufferings in their preſent bitterneſſe, unleſſe we look alſo upon the iſſue of them; for, ſo much d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th Chriſt teach us in his own caſe, that they ſhould not only conſider that he did go, but <hi>whither</hi> he did go 8. The iſſue of Chriſt and his followers troubles, is not eaſily diſcerned by us; nor can we underſtand it, without his teaching, for, it is he who muſt re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lve that queſtion, <hi>whither goeſt thou?</hi> and it muſt be <hi>asked</hi> at him. 9. Chriſt is moſt willing to teach his people, what may be for their inſtruction and comfort, and will quarrel when they do not put him to it: for, he quarrelleth, that <hi>none of you asketh me, whither goeſt thou?</hi> 10. It is the great ſin of Saints to trifle away their time, and, particularly, not to emprove ſhort op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of enjoying Chriſt, and before a ſtorme; that they may get ſomewhat to fit them for it; for it is his challenge, that knowing he was to depart ſhortly, they paſſed away that moment in ſorrow and ſtupidity, not emproving the preſent opportunity of his company, to reſolve caſes, which might be comfortable to them, when he was gone. <hi>Now I go my way, and none of you asketh me, whither goeſt thou?</hi> Where he inſinuateth, that it was their duty to be throng and buſie, during that moment. 11. Men may ſeem to be ſomewhat buſie about important caſes, and in ſeeking reſolution of great difficulties, who yet in Chriſts account are but really idle; for, albeit <hi>Peter</hi> did propound this very queſtion to him <hi>chap.</hi> 13.36. yet he challengeth, <hi>none of you asketh, &amp;c</hi> becauſe he did not ſo aske as ſeeking the right uſe of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to be confirmed in the exerciſe of believing, or informed concerning the effects of his departure for that end; but only in a way of carping, and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous boaſting of his own ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As it is no wonder Saints be, oft-times, exerciſed with ſorrow under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of trouble; ſo it is moſt uſual for them to keep no moderation in their ſorrow, but to let looſe the reines to themſelves in it: for, <hi>ſorrow filled their heart.</hi> 2. Chriſt approveth not of immoderate ſorrow in his followers, did the cauſe and riſe thereof ſeem never ſo lawful; as being an imputation on him, as if he were a cruel Maſter, and a mean to deferre others from his ſervice; Therefore doth he challenge them for this, <hi>ſorrow hath filled your heart.</hi> 3. It is the great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Saints, that, in their diſtempers, they turn even the good Word of God, which is ſpoken for their encouragement, into matter of grief and ſorrow; for, ſaith he, <hi>becauſe I have ſaid theſe things unto you, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath filled your heart.</hi> This intimation tended to guard their hearts, and the newes contained what was uſeful and comfortable for them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and <hi>chap.</hi> 14.28. and yet they filled them with ſorrow. 4. A great cauſe of Saints exceſſive diſtempers under the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48148:169"/>
diſpenſations wherewith they are exerciſed, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are too much addicted to ſenſe; ſo that if it be not ſatisfied with the outward or inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible comforts, which ſometime accompany Profeſſion and Religion; or if they be deprived of what is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſweet and pleaſant to them, they account all to be gone; whereas beleeving is more comfortable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: And, becauſe they look for great things in the world, and therefore are confounded with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their expectations; for, it was upon theſe grounds theſe newes did ſo afflict them: They were exceedingly taken up with his ſenſible bodily preſence, and hoped to be advanced in the world by him, when he ſhould come to that temporal Kingdome which they dreamed of; And therefore could not endure to hear of his removal, which deprived them of their preſent enjoyments, and future carnal hopes. 5. Immoderate and exceſſive ſorrow is exceeding ſinful, (as for other reaſons, ſo) becauſe it ſtupifieth men, and layeth them by from needful duty, to which they are called in their difficulties; for, he reprehends their ſorrow, not only in it ſelfe, but as it cauſed that ſinful negligence, which he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this to <hi>v.</hi> 16. we have the firſt encouragement, whereby Chriſt ſweetens theſe ſad tidings, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to mitigate their exceſſive ſorrow.

He aſſerts in this verſe, that they could not partake of that mercy, but upon his removal. 2. In the following purpoſe, he propounds the benefits to be expected by the Spirits coming, beyond what they enjoyed by his bodily preſence, that ſo they might be induced to ſubmit to his departure, as making way for the Comforters coming.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe Chriſt aſſerts that, however they reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the newes of his departure; yet it was expedient, and for their behoof, that he ſhould remove. Which he cleareth, by ſhewing the neceſſary connexion betwixt his departure, and the Spirits coming, who is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a gift. This he inſtructs, both negatively, that if he did not go away, the Spirit would not come; and poſitively, that upon his removal he would ſend him unto them; which is not to be underſtood, as if they or others could not, or had not received the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſcenſion; But that the Spirit was not to be poured out ſo largely upon the members, till after his exaltation and glorification, who is their Head, as <hi>chap.</hi> 7, 39. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts dealing may be very expedient and uſeful, when yet it is very unſatisfactory to ſenſe; for, what filled their heart with ſorrow, <hi>is nevertheleſſe expedient for you,</hi> ſaith he. So that he is to be Judge of what is good for us, and not we our ſelves. 2. We are, ordinarily, ſo addicted to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſenſe, that the uſefulneſſe of an afflicted and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling condition is hardly beleeved, even out of Chriſts own mouth; Therefore muſt he ſo ſtrongly aſſert it, <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient.</hi> 3. As all Chriſts Word is of infallible verity, ſo we are to look on it as ſuch, that it may comfort us under afflictions, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us againſt the teſtimony and apprehenſion of our ſenſe; Therefore doth he lead them to lean on this, as their ſupport, under all tentations to the contrary, <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi> 4. As Chriſt doth nothing for, or to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but what is uſeful and profitable for them; ſo he is ſo tender, as not to withhold what is uſeful, becauſe it ſatisfieth not their ſenſe, but is grievous to their fleſh; as knowing well, that what is profitable will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in end, however they look on it for preſent; for, it was of his mercy, that ſince it was <hi>expedient</hi> he went away; therefore he did go, let them reſent it for preſent never ſo ſadly. 5. Chriſts people and their welfare are ſo dear to him, that in all that he did, and that befel him, and in all the changes of his condition, he was ſtill doing and minding that which was for their profit, for, as it was becauſe it was expedient for them, that he came to earth, and ſtayed in it; ſo he went away again, not becauſe he was weary of them and their company, nor yet only becauſe he was to be glorified himſelf, but, <hi>becauſe it is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> and be exalted into glory. 6. The Spirit of God, as he is largely communicate under the Goſpel, is ſo ſweet an Advocate and Comforter, that his preſence may compenſe the ſaddeſt of loſſes, were it even of the bodily preſence of Chriſt; for, here it is inſinuate, that he is ſuch a gift, as it is a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to want Chriſts bodily preſence, to make way for his coming; And that, becauſe he is <hi>that Comforter,</hi> by way of excellencie, above that comfort they had by his bodily preſence, and who can comfort beleevers in all places at once, whereas his bodily preſence was confined to one place; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come, but if I go, I will ſend him.</hi> 7. As Chriſts bodily preſence is not the moſt powerful and refreſhing way of comfort, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was needful in its time, and refreſhful in its meaſure; ſo beleevers are not capable of the full conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Spirit, but by the removal of his bodily preſence out of the world; for, not only did he, by his death and going out of the world, merit it, and he muſt be glorified, and enter into his Kingdome, before his members participate ſo largely of his fulneſſe; but they were ſo dull while he was with them, that they could not be capable of theſe comforts, till they were weaned from a bodily preſence, and exerciſed with trouble; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come.</hi> So that they who doat ſtill on a corporal preſence of Chriſt, do thereby ſtop the way of the comforts of a ſpiritual preſence, 8. Chriſt, by ſending of the Spirit after his Aſcenſion, doth not only prove himſelf true God, the ſecond Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity; from whom (as from the Father) the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth and is ſent; But alſo, That as Mediatour, juſtice is ſatisfied by his death; That he, as the Head of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, is glorified, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.39. and entred in poſſeſſion

of his dignity. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33, and, That being thus exalted, he is ſtill mindful of his brethren. So much is imported in this, <hi>If I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> 9. Chriſt being now exalted, there is free acceſs to partake of the Spirit, by all theſe who do employ him for that effect; for, being <hi>departed,</hi> he <hi>will ſend him</hi> to them who ask him.</p>

                  <p>The benefits to be reaped by the Spirits coming, (which would richly compenſe his departure) are three; The firſt relates to the world, whom the Spirit will convince of three great points, ſin, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and judgement; which being here named only, are diſtinctly inſiſted upon in the three following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the grounds upon which they ſhall be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of every one of them, and the evidences thereof, produced.</p>
                  <p>For clearing of this purpoſe a little, Conſider, Firſt, as for the Act here aſcribed to the Spirit, of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,</hi> or rather, <hi>convincing,</hi> I take it to import, not only his offering and affording ſufficient meanes, which might convince men, but alſo the ſucceſſe of theſe means, and his effectual and actual convincing of them thereby; And that not only by illuminating them with knowledge, which may be without convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; nor yet by bearing in challenges and reproofes only, for there may be challenges and reproofes without through conviction; But further, by arguing them out of their principles and grounds to a contrary opinion, (as the word imports) and bearing in of truth ſo, as they are put to ſilence, and cannot in reaſon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for the object of this work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by <hi>the world,</hi> who ſhall be convinced, I underſtand men in the world; and particularly, men in the ſtate of nature, and yet unconverted, whether they be elect or reprobate, and that not a few, but many of them: All which are frequentlie expreſſed in Scripture by the name of <hi>the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as for the nature, ſcope and tendencie of this work of conviction, what it ſhall produce or tend to, there is ſome difficultie in determining thereof; for ſome, however they ſpeak of this conviction of the world in general, as a common work, yet in explication of the particulars, whereof they are to be convinced, they reſtrict it to the world of the Elect, whom the Spirit convinceth of theſe things in order unto, and in working of their Converſion, as ſhall be after clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Others again, do reſtrict all of it to the reprobates, who get no more but conviction, or, at leaſt, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of a work of conviction of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, common to both Elect and reprobates, whereby the Spirit beareth witneſſe unto Chriſt, and the truth of Chriſtian Religion among men; whether the Lord carry them on a farther length, or let the work ſiſt only there. I do conceive it moſt ſuitable to underſtand it as comprehending both of theſe, both what is common to elect and reprobates, and what the Spirit further works upon the elect in the work of their Converſion. And for clearing hereof, and the ſcope of the whole purpoſe. I ſhall ſpeak a little to a few things. 1. It would be conſidered, that however the purpoſe here mentioned, do relate to what the Spirit will work upon the world; yet Chriſts ſcope in ſpeaking of it, is to encourage his diſciples, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away, for I will ſend the Comforter to you, and be ſhall convince the world.</hi> They were much ſadned with the apprehenſion of his removal, and that in his abſence they were to be engaged in a difficult ſervice of the Miniſtry, and of ſtanding for him, wherein they might probably expect much hazard and difficulty, and little ſucceſſe; they being but weak men; their Maſter, for whom they ſtood, but deſpiſed, as a ſeducer and mock King, even among the Jewes; their meſſage very unpleaſant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, and the principles univerſally received, and carnal intereſts of men: and conſequently, the oppoſition to be made unto them, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, violent and univerſal. Now to guard againſt all theſe, Chriſt giveth this encouragement (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that they ſhould receive the Spirit, by whom this raging world ſhould be convinced, and ſo their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition taken off, or blunted and made eaſie. 2. This being Chriſts ſcope in this encouragement, it is moſt ſafe to extend this promiſed conviction to all the effects of their Miniſtry, and of the Spirits work accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the ſame, both on the Elect and Reprobates; And, that we ſo take in his common work upon them, who are reprobates, and continue ſtill in the ſtate of nature, notwithſtanding that work; as we ſeclude not his ſaving work in gathering and drawing in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for, as it was to be a comfort to them, to ſee the Spirit ſo owning them, as even the world ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: ſo it would be much more comfortable to them, when the Spirit ſhould make that conviction ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on any, and ſo not only take off, or blunt their oppoſition, but make them real friends, 3. It would be conſidered, (for clearing the purpoſe) what were the means of working this conviction, or the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit in bringing about the ſame, for the encouragement of the diſciples. Theſe were many, without, and extrinſecal unto the perſons convinced, if taken one by one; as namely, the extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments conferred in large meaſure upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whereby they, who were known to be unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mean men, were enabled to ſpeak with many tongues, and to preach learnedly, powerfully and boldly; Their daily preachings (being thus endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of the ſweet doctrine of the Goſpel; and the Law in ſubordination thereunto; and that notwithſtanding all their ſufferings and ill uſage, which they went through with invincible courage and fortitude; The many miracles and cures wrought by their hands; The caſting out of devils; The gifts of the Spirit conferred by the laying on of their hands; The ſilencing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans oracles through the world, by the ſound of their Miniſtry; and, The glorious effects of their doctrine, where it was received, by deſtroying the kingdom and power of Satan, and bringing in of light, holineſſe, and conſolation. Unto theſe (and divers others) without
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48148:170"/>
them, ſeveral operations are to be added, which were wrought in, or upon, the perſons convinced; As namely, extraordinary cures wrought upon ſome of themſelves, both Elect and reprobate; Common and clear illumination, and temporary gifts, conferred upon both of them, and ſome of them in an extraordinary meaſure; Strong impreſſions to take notice of theſe operations of the Spirit without them; Together with ſaving operations accompanying all theſe upon the hearts of the Elect. 5. The effects of theſe means and operations, or the conviction it ſelfe wrought thereby, to the encouragement of the Apoſtles, come next to be conſidered. And as theſe means were extraordinary, ſo the effects were to be anſwerable. For if we look upon the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which containeth a ſignal accompliſhment of this prediction, we will finde ſtrange effects following upon the pouring out of the Spirit, even in theſe who were not converted, at leaſt not as yet; Some were pricked at the heart, who had not yet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to evangelical repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. with 38. Some, in the gall of bitterneſs, did deſire to ſhare with the Apoſtles in their great priviledges, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.18, 19. Some upon their thrones were almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians, by a priſoner in a chain, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28. ſome had ſtrange changes, illuminations, and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhes, for a time, who yet were not converted, as is to be ſuppoſed of many, who were drawn in by the Apoſtles preaching, and of others who afterward did, and daily do embrace the Goſpel; Some were forced to magnifie them, who did not joyne with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.13. Some would have worſhipped them, who were yet Pagans, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.10, 11. Some were aſtoniſhed with what was done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14. and with their fortitude and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Acts</hi> 4 13. and were non pluſſed in their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions what to do with them, when they were in their power, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.16, 17. yea, and ſo bridled, that they were affraid to meddle with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5, 34, 35. unto all which, and many more wounderful effects of theſe operations, may be added, That the Elect did not only ſhare in theſe common operations, but were in due time, (by theſe means, and particularly by the Word) ſavingly convinced and brought to Chriſt and fixed upon him. All which conviction though it be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>the world,</hi> and was indeed very general in proceſſe of time; Yet it is to be underſtood with this neceſſary limitation that ſome, yea many, remained ſtill in their ſtupidity, and were not effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced for all this; Yea, ſome who were convinced, were yet not bridled, but given up to contradict, and blaſpheme againſt the holy Ghoſt, for the trial and exerciſe of the Apoſtles, and other profeſſours, and that the Spirit might magnifie his power in them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, by their invincible courage and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Gods preſerving of them many times, and making the work proſper in their hands in the midſt of their ſufferings, more then if theſe malicious men had never oppoſed them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as for the particulars whereof they are to be convinced, <hi>ſin righteouſneſs, and judgement,</hi> they come to be more diſtinctly ſpoken to in the following verſes, where the grounds of this conviction are ſpoken of. Here, in general, it ſufficeth us to know, 1. If we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ook upon this work of conviction, as it is common to elect and reprobate, and as the Spirits teſtimony about them relates to Chriſt and the Chriſtian Religion; Theſe were the points of contraverſie betwixt the Apoſtles in preaching of the Goſpel, and the world; For, Chriſt being the ſubject of the Goſpel, the great oppoſition related unto him, whether he was the Son of God and true Meſſiah, and therefore, whether they were guilty of great ſin who did not beleeve him, and receive his teſtimony, and continued ſtill in a ſtate of ſin ſo long as they embraced not him: Whether he was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in himſelfe, and the only giver of righteouſneſs to ſinners, or a ſeducer and Samaritan, and one without whom they were righteous, as the world alleaged: And, whether he was an exalted Prince, above Satan, and all powers and idols, able to abſolve his friends and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and condemne his enemies; or only a mockery and a baſe perſon, as he was traduced to be. All which he promiſeth ſhall be determined to their advantage. 2. If we look on this, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it is proper to the Elect, in the work of their converſion, the words contain a ſweet method of bringing about this work; firſt, to convince them of ſin, by letting them ſee the hazard of their natural condition, through continuance in unbelief. Next, to convince them of righteouſneſſe to be had in Chriſt only, as a remedy to this condition. And then to convince them of judgement and dominion, and of deliverance from ſpiritual ſlavery, and the pulling down of Satans kingdome, by being in him. Of all which, albeit the reprobate may get a common conviction, as it is hinted in the former conſideration; yet theſe things are further, and more effectually and ſavingly, carried on in the hearts of the Elect, to their converſion and ſetling upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This purpoſe, thus explained by parts, may be taken up in this brief ſumme; That whereas the Apoſtles after Chriſts departure, were to be engaged in hard ſervice, with much diſadvantage and difficulty; Chriſt comforts them, by ſhewing that he would poure ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit upon them, and by his Spirit ſo accompany them in their Miniſtry, as ſhould make it ſucceſſeful in the world, to the conviction even of enemies and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and to the further gaining upon others; So that the work ſhould go on, his Kingdome be eſtabliſhed in the world, and his glory ſhine, and they be comforted and carried through, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition they ſhould meet with.</p>
                  <p>From the words, ſo cleared, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The ſervice of the Miniſters of Chriſt, in carrying through the work of the Goſpel, is not only difficult, but impoſſible, unleſſe they be ſingularly aſſiſted by Chriſt therein; for, ſo is here imported, that they need the Spirit for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of this work. 2. The Spirit of Chriſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying weak means and inſtruments, can bring about great things, to the advancement of his Kingdome in the world, without any viſible force, and with meere ſpiritual weapons, in deſpight of all oppoſition can be made thereunto; for, ſo is here promiſed, that the Spirit, in them and with them, ſhall effectuate this work, how weak ſo ever they were. 3. It is the great conſolation of Chriſts faithful ſervants and followers, to enjoy his preſence and bleſſing upon their calling and employment, and particularly, of faithful Miniſters, to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48148:170"/>
have his Kingdome proſper, and men wrought upon by their Miniſtry; for, this is the Apoſtles encouragement, and in this the Spirit is a <hi>Comforter</hi> to them, that he ſhall <hi>convince the world,</hi> to make their labours ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 4. The men of the world are very corrupt and ill principled in reference to the doctrine of the Goſpel; and have very many mountains ſtanding in the way thereof; for, they need to be <hi>convinced</hi> of all theſe points here mentioned, and have opinions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples oppoſite thereunto to be rooted out, as the Word imports. 5. Theſe corrupt principles of the world are not eaſie to be rooted out, but will require great light and ſtrong conviction, before they be put from them; for, they muſt be <hi>convinced,</hi> and <hi>argued</hi> out of them to the contrary opinion, before they quit them. 6. For conviction of the world, it will not be ſufficient that never ſo ſharp reproofes be given them, nor yet only that they have clear light and evidence of what they are to aſſent unto; unleſſe alſo the Spirit come to bear in theſe things upon them, and effectually convince thereof; for, it is he who muſt <hi>convince the world,</hi> not only by ſufficient external means and operations without them, but by inward working, making that effectual. 7. The Spirit of the Lord is an effectual convincer, where he pleaſeth to work, where clear illumination and ſtrong reaſoning will not avail, he can irreſiſtibly convince and batter down ſtrong holds; And, where he will not convert, yet he can ſo put to ſilence and bridle oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſhall be ineffectual: for <hi>he ſhall convince the world,</hi> ſaith he. 8. As Chriſts ſaving work on his people muſt begin with, and be carryed on by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Spirit; So they may get convictions and that by the Spirit, who never yet more, and are never converted: for, on the one hand, conviction is ſo far from ſaving grace, that they who have it in a deep meaſure, have yet need not only of faith, but alſo of repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.37, 38. and on the other hand, it concerneth God in his honour, ſometime, to go this far on with the world, for the promoving of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that they may not go on with a high hand; Therefore it is promiſed, that he ſhall <hi>convince</hi> even <hi>the world.</hi> So that they who were never convinced, are yet in a worſe condition, and do not know how ſoon the Lord may kindle that ſire in their boſome, though they ſleep ſecure for the preſent. And men would not reſt upon convictions, when the Lord lets them ſee <hi>ſinne,</hi> and yet never removeth it, <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and yet never conferreth it, and <hi>judgement</hi> of authority, to abſolve the righteous and condemne the wicked, and yet never giveth them to flee to Chriſt to obtain the one, or to be freed from the other. 9. The Spirits manifeſtations and operations in the primitive dayes of the Goſpel, do abundantly aſſert the truth of Chriſtian Religion, and refute all the corrupt principles of men concerning Chriſt; So that all who then ſaw or felt them, or ſince do hear thereof, by the ſound of the Goſpel (ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the ordinary operations of the Spirit where it is received) are without excuſe if they continue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, or averſe and oppoſite unto the true Religion, and Chriſt offered in the Goſpel; for, by theſe means the Spirit hath <hi>convinced the world, of ſinne, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgement,</hi> as the great points in contraverſie concerning Chriſt and the Chriſtian Religion, as hath been cleared. So that however all in all ages be not actually convinced, yet (beſide that generally it is ſo, in ſome meaſure, where the Goſpel cometh) it is a ſtanding teſtimony leaving all theſe without excuſe who hear the Goſpel, and yet continue in Atheiſme, Infidelity, Scepticiſme and Irriligion. And the effectual conviction of others leaves them yet more without excuſe. 10. As there are many ſteps and degrees of operation in converting ſouls to Chriſt: So the Spirit of the Lord, where he undertaketh this work in his own, will effectually carry them through them all, in their due order; for, ſo much alſo doth this work of <hi>convincing of ſinne, righteouſneſs, &amp;c</hi> as it is proper to the Elect, import, That he will not only give them a light touch, and in effectual impreſſion of theſe things which reprobates may have, but will effectually carry them from ſtep to ſtep till they be convinced of the truth of theſe things, and of their need of the two laſt, and made to cloſe therewith to their comfort. And herein the order of the Spirit is to be obſerved, ſo that if we miſſe the comfortable conviction of righteouſneſs, we would ſee if we do not ſtop it by want of conviction of ſinne, and if we want comfortable conviction of freedome from ſlavery and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The particulars generally named in the former verſe, are now more particularly inſiſted on, and cleared from the grounds upon which the world ſhall be convinced of them. And firſt, for ſin, they ſhall be convinced thereof, becauſe they beleeve not in him; Which, being taken more generally in reference to the conviction of the world, both Elect and reprobate, holds out, That the operations of the Spirit, communicate by and from Chriſt now aſcended, ſhall prove him to be the Son of God, the great Prophet, and true Meſſiah, and ſo ſhall convince them of their great ſin in rejecting, and not beleeving him and his teſtimony. Being taken more particularly in reference to the Elect, it holds out, That the Spirit ſhall begin at convincing them of ſin, and ſhall withal convince, that the wretchedneſſe and deſperateneſſe of their condition lieth not ſo much in their other ſins, as in their unbelief, and not cloſing with Chriſt. Whereof the world alſo may get a taſt, in being convinced of their miſerable condition by reaſon of ſin, ſince they do not embrace him the remedy, though they do never amend it, whereas the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The world without Chriſt is lying in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition and ſtate of ſin; for, ſo is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. 2. The world is ſo blinde and ſtubborne in their courſe of ſinning, that neither natural light, nor judgements and afflictions, yea, nor the doctrine of the Word, without the aſſiſtance of the Spirit will diſcover ſin, nor let them ſee the ſinfulneſſe thereof; And that becauſe men are blind by nature, that they ſee not their own caſe; and they have ſo many ſubter-fuges, of fathering their ſins on others, (as <hi>Adam, Evah,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.22, 23, 24.) of pretence of cuſtome, of giving fair names to foul ſins,

Yea, and loving kindneſſe, muſt be applyed and beleeved, before ſin be abominable as it ought, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. 3. The Spirit is able to convince men, who otherwiſe will not be convinced of ſin, and doth ſo to many whom he will never convert; for, <hi>he ſhall convince the world of ſinne.</hi> 4. Conviction of ſin is the firſt work that the Spirit works upon a ſoul, which he is to draw in to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for, this conviction in reference to the Elect, beginneth here. 5 Unbelief is the great ſin, whereof men are to be convinced, and do need the Spirit for that end. This holds true in diverſe reſpects. 1. If we look on this ſin in it ſelfe, it is the great ſin againſt the Goſpel, and their great guilt who oppoſed and rejected him; A ſin greater then any againſt the Law, and very injurious to Chriſt, and a ſin, that (however men by natures light may ſee other ſins,) we will never ſee the ill of it, but by the Spirit. 2. If we look on it in reference to other ſins, it is the ſin that defiles all our actions, how morally good ſoever they be; the ſin that binds all our other ſins upon us, ſeeing it is only by faith in Chriſt we draw vertue for ſubduing thereof; and, the ſin which renders all our other ſins incurable and unpardonable, as being a ſin againſt the remedy, and holding us back from it; Therefore is this conviction of ſin thus inſtructed, <hi>becauſe they beleeve not on me,</hi> Not only as it is a prime and great ſin in it ſelfe, but as it hath influence on other ſins, and ſerveth to convince men of the woful ill of their ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ul condition, ſo long as they continue to reject the remedy. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. It is not enough men ſee a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hey will never know how to ſet about the cure of it: Therefore, in convincing <hi>of ſin,</hi> he convinceth of unbelief as the root from whence the miſery, or, at leaſt, the deſperateneſſe of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſloweth. 7. All conviction of ſin is ineffectual, unleſſe men alſo ſee their unbelief, and the ſinfulneſſe thereof, to be convinced of it, and humbled for it; for, ſo much doth this working of the Spirit import, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth <hi>of ſin, becauſe they beleeve not on me.</hi> 8. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is a duty, ſo ſpiritual, and above the reach of nature, and a duty which ſouls convinced of ſin are ſo averſe from, that the neglect hereof, and the ſin of unbelief, will not be ſeen without the working of the Spirit; for, this is a conviction of ſin, requiring the operation of the Spirit, that men ſee themſelves guilty of ſin, <hi>becauſe they beleeve not on him.</hi> 9. When ſelfe-condemned ſinners, are led to finde faith, and the neceſſity thereof, preſſed upon them, and are made to ſee the ill of unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to endeavour to be rid of it, and to eſſay faith; They ought not to look on this as a tentation, or preſumption in them, but as the very work of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The next thing whereof the Spirit convinceth the world, is <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> not their own, but Chriſts; And that both the righteouſneſſe of his perſon, and his righteouſneſſe as Mediatour, imputed to his people to their Juſtification. Both theſe are ſtrongly grounded and concluded from this, that he goeth to the Father, and continueth with him, ſo that even his diſciples ſee him no more after his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cenſion. For, 1. When the Spirit, ſent from Chriſt, by his extraordinary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth make it manifeſt that Chriſt remained not dead, but roſe again, and aſcendeth and liveth with the Father in glory and Majeſty, (as theſe gifts and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent down by him do evidence,) it will neceſſarily follow, that he was not a ſeducer and Samaritan, but that righteous One, Who, however he was rejected of men, yet, is approven of God. 2. As Chriſt laid down his life to purchaſe righteouſneſſe for us, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was unattainable by the works of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. ſo by his reſurrection and aſcenſion, and pouring out of the Spirit in large meaſure, he makes it evident, that he is accepted by the Father in our name, and liveth for ever to apply his righteouſneſſe unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. So the ſcope of this is, That however the world did traduce Chriſt, and, leaning to their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, did reject him and his righteouſneſs. Yet the Spirits coming, as a fruit of his aſcenſion, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that he was juſt and righteous, and that righteouſneſs is to be had only in and through him; And further, this ſame Spirit, making uſe of theſe means, and particularly of the Word, ſhall convince ſelfe-condemned ſinners, that they ought, and may relie on him for righteouſneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Even Chriſt himſelfe was not free from the horrid imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the foul mouths of traducers, more then his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; for, his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> was in debate among them. 2. Whatever be the imputations c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mities, yet his going to his Father after that did ſerve ſufficiently to convince them. 3. Chriſts exaltation with the Father, and the evidences thereof communicate to the Church by the Spirit, do abundantly proclaime him to be that holy and righteous One, of whom it is blaſphemy to harbour any prejudice and miſconſtruction; for, <hi>he ſhall convince the world of righteouſneſſe, becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> 4. It is not ſufficient that men be convinced of ſin, unleſs they alſo be driven to ſeek righteouſneſs to cover the ſame; for, this <hi>conviction of righteouſneſſe</hi> muſt follow upon the former, of conviction of ſin. And without this, neither a ſight of ſin, nor acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt as righteous in his own perſon, will availe. 5. It is a point which the Spirit hath put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contraverſie, that the righteouſneſſe of fallen man is only in and through Chriſt; ſo that all who ſeek another way of righteouſneſſe, do go againſt a clear conviction; for, <hi>he ſhall convince the world of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> 6. Imputed righteouſneſſe is a point whereof the Spirit only can convince men, and make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

to it. Men are not only naturally ignorant thereof, as not being according to the Covenant of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. but their proud hearts are averſe from ſuch a way of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. and ſelfe-condemned ſinners, finding nothing in themſelves, are affraied to lean to that which is without them, till the Spirit bear it in upon them, and cauſe them to cloſe with it: Therefore they muſt be <hi>convinced of the righteouſneſſe,</hi> and that by the Spirit. 7. Chriſts acceptation with the Father after his ſuffering, evidenced by the pouring out of the Spirit, doth evidence his righteouſneſſe to be ſo perfect and acceptable to the Father, and himſelfe in ſuch a capacity to apply his righteouſneſs, and to own them who flee unto him; That ſelfe-condemned ſinners may with confidence reſt under the ſhadow of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: for, ſo much is imported, in that he will <hi>convince of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father,</hi> and there live for ever to make interceſſion. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. 8. Such as would have the comfortable uſe of Chriſts righteouſneſs, muſt not lean to ſenſe or ſight, but betake themſelves to faith; for ſo much may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in that, <hi>ye ſee me no more,</hi> which not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his going unto, and continuing with the Father, becauſe they ſee him no more, but finde rich gifts come from him; but ſheweth, that in participation of his righteouſneſſe, they muſt not expect to have ſenſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a bodily ſight of him.

                  <p>The laſt thing whereof the Spirit convinceth the world, is, <hi>judgement,</hi> in the underſtanding whereof, we will be much helped by what is ſaid on <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 31. For <hi>judgement</hi> in Scripture, in relation to the object, on things about which it is employed, doth oft-times ſignifie, the exerciſe of power and authority to diſpoſe of them, and put and keep them in order. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſubject, and perſon in whom it is, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, the having of authority. So to order theſe things, Here the interpretation may be fetched from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. that Jeſus in his exaltation is made both <hi>Lord and Chriſt,</hi> and here the Spirit convinceth the world that he is both; That he is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by convincing them of his righteouſneſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and, That he is <hi>Lord,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them of <hi>judgement,</hi> and that all power and judgement is committed to him; which is evidenced and proven by his judging Satan the prince of the world, over whom he triumphed in the Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and made his purchaſe and conqueſt evident by his caſting out of Satan, from theſe poſſeſſed by him, his ſilencing Satans Oracles in the world, and caſting him out of theſe who receive the Goſpel, and are converted, deſtroying the Kingdome of wickedneſſe and darkneſs, and tranſlating them into his own Kingdome, and into a ſtate of holineſſe and light. This the general ſcope of this purpoſe, that the world ſhall be convinced of Chriſts dominion, by his ſeen power over Satan, under which (among many other things) is to be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a judgement of condemnation of all the wicked in Satan their Prince and head; and a judgement of abſolution, and vindication into liberty and freedome from Satans ſlavery, in favours of theſe who flee to him, and in whom the work and Kingdome of Satan is deſtroyed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Satan is a Prince, who, by his tyrannical uſurpation, and by a voluntary conſent of deluded ſouls, doth get and exerciſe a tyrannical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the children of men, ſo long as they are without Chriſt; for, he is <hi>the Prince of this world</hi> 2. Chriſt by his death did condemne and overcome Satan, and hath made his conqueſt evident to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of men, by the effects and operations of his Spirit, in doctrine condemning Satan and his work in men, caſting him out miraculouſly, and deſtroying his work in beleevers; for, he ſuppoſeth it as a clear and undeniably truth, that <hi>the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> 3. By this judging of Satan, the Spirit hath made it undeniably evident, that Chriſt hath all authority and power to preſerve his Church, triumph over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and order all the confuſions that Satan and ſin have occaſioned in the world; for, whatever were their thoughts of Chriſt, yet when it ſhall be evident that Chriſt took Satan, the great diſturber, to task, and foiled him, it cannot in reaſon be denied, but he is Soveraigne Judge and Lord, having all power in his hand, and all his adverſaries under his feet: <hi>He ſhall convince the world of judgement, becauſe the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> 4.

                  <p>Hitherto Chriſt hath inſiſted upon the firſt benefit to be expected by the coming of the Spirit, for their encouragement; The ſecond followeth, in theſe verſes, relating more immediately to the Apoſtles themſelves; wherein is promiſed, That however, for preſent, they were not capable of the many things he had to ſay unto them, <hi>v.</hi> 12. yet the Spirit ſhould, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſupply that defect: And, 1. Should guide them into all truth, as being the Spirit of truth, and ſpeaking what is common to him with the Father and Sonne. 2 Should ſhew them things to come, by being a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prophecie to them, as extraordinarily gifted men, and by revealing the great things abiding them and others, as beelevers, <hi>v.</hi> 13. how this purpoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 12. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 13. ought to be underſtood, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cleared on <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 25, 26. compare alſo <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 15. In ſumme it imports, That whereas Chriſt had ſpoken many things ſummarily, which he was ready to enlarge, but that their incapacity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him; he here undertaketh that the Spirit ſhould make up this, by enlightening their underſtanding to take up what he had ſaid, and by explaining and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the ſame more diſtinctly. They who (to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unwritten traditions,) do aſſert from this, that the Spirit did teach ſomewhat, which Chriſt had not taught them, do nothing at all promove their own cauſe; for whatever was taught them by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by the Spirit afterward, was by them faithfully communicated to the Church, and committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And for theſe things which men urge as unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten traditions, beſide the Sripture, they are ſuch toyes as Chriſt needed not ſay, <hi>ye cannot bear them,</hi> ſeeing they might eaſily be born by them, who have leſſe then the Apoſtles then had, and are more common and trivial then many things he had taught them. From <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Many are the precious truths of the Goſpel, to be learned by beleevers, and which are needful and comfortable for them to know; for, there are <hi>many things to ſay.</hi> 2. Chriſts heart is ſo large, and ſo tender toward his followers, that he hath never ſaid enough when he hath ſaid moſt, for their inſtruction and encouragement: for, after all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſweet doctrine, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Our hearing and learning much of divine truth, ought to tend, mainly to let us know that there is more to be learned, that ſo we may be humbled in what we know, and our deſires may be kindled after the knowledge of more; Therefore alſo doth he break off the former ſweet inſtructions with this, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you.</hi> 4. As men by nature are uncapable of divine truths, till they be taught them by the Spirit; ſo even they who have received the Spirit, in ſome meaſure, may yet remain very incapable, ſo long as they want a further meaſure of the Spirit, and do continue under weakneſſe and errours of minde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing them, or do give up themſelves to exceſſive ſorrow; for, ſo it was even with the diſciples, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the meaſure of the Spirit they had received.

Men are never ſufficiently capable of divine truths, unleſſe their underſtandings do comprehend them, and their hearts and affections do digeſt them, as not to be ſtumbled or quarrelled at, that ſo they may reap the fruit of them; for ſo much doth the expreſſion, <hi>ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them,</hi> import. It may allude to burden-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who do ſhrink under too heavy burdens, as their weak underſtandings and preoccupied affections were ready to do under theſe high and ſpiritual truths; or, to weak ſtomacks which caſt up the ſtrong meat they cannot digeſt. 6. The moſt choice of outward means and advantages will not profit men, nor cauſe them to make progreſſe, unleſſe the Spirit concurre therewith; for, they had even Chriſt to teach them, and yet they <hi>cannot bear</hi> his words to profit thereby. 7. Our own infirmity, dulneſſe and incapacity, do obſtruct our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and hinder the revelation of many precious truths unto us; for, Chriſt ſaith, not theſe <hi>many things,</hi> becauſe they <hi>cannot bear them.</hi> 8. As Chriſt takes particular notice of the ſtate of his diſciples; ſo he tenderly deals with them according to their ſtrength, and condeſcends to their weakneſſe and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; for, he ſpares at this time to let out theſe things unto them, becauſe they <hi>cannot bear them now.</hi> See <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There are no infirmities of Saints, wherein they do not approve themſelves, for which Chriſt hath not a remedy; nor do they loſe any opportunity which he cannot make up; Therefore, whereas they loſt many advantages they might have reaped in his company, by their own greatneſs, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns this as a comfort, that it ſhould be made up by the Spirits coming. 2. It is by the Spirit only, that men, who do not profit under outward means, will be enabled to profit; who when he cometh, doth reveal truths clearly, and bear them in with life and power upon the heart, and doth renew mens ſpirits to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and ſubmit unto them; for, it is by this means that the diſciples loſſes are made up, <hi>Howbeit, when the Spirit is come, he will guide you.</hi> 3. As it is the duty of beleevers, to know all revealed truths, neceſſary for them in order to ſalvation, or in their places and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo they will need the Spirits teaching and guiding, for taking up all and every divine truth, even the leaſt and ſmalleſt point of it; for, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>he guide into all truth.</hi> 4. The doctrine revealed by the Spirit unto the Apoſtle, containeth all neceſſary truths, and ſo is a moſt perfect rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for, it is promiſed unto them, that <hi>he will guide you into all truth.</hi> 5. It doth ſet forth both the truth and divine authority of the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that it is taught by the Spirit, who is a Spirit of truth, and that the doctrine is not his only, but

communicate by him from the Father and Son alſo; Therefore is he here called <hi>the Spirit of truth.</hi> And it is given as a reaſon why he will <hi>guide into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf only, but whatſoever he ſhall hear</hi> (with and from the Father and the Son,) <hi>that ſhall he ſpeak.</hi> 6. It contributes to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of beleevers, that the Spirit of God, who taketh charge of them, knoweth things to come, and ſo can reveal them that they may be encouraged or warned, and hath a ſoveraign providence over and about them; for, this his knowledge is imported, in that he will <hi>ſhew things to come.</hi> 7. The Spirit of Chriſt did com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municate unto the Apoſtles, and by them unto the Church, ſuch infallible predictions of things to come, as were needful to be known, and are uſeful to the Church in all ages; for, <hi>he will ſhew you things to come,</hi> ſaith he. 8.

And where he cometh, doth ſo clearly and fully perſwade believers thereof, as may bear them out under all preſent preſſures and diſcouragements: Thus alſo doth <hi>ſhew things to come,</hi> by their doctrine, and to them and all ſucceeding believers.</p>

                  <p>The third benefit to be expected by the Spirits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (and an enlargement of the former) is, that he ſhall glorifie Chriſt, by communicating and ſhewing unto them, what he receives of him.

Albeit Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doctrine, actions and ſufferings, in the ſtate of his humiliation, were clouded under obſcurity and ignominie; yet as he is ſtill glorious in himſelf, ſo the Spirit after his Aſcenſion did, and in all ages doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his glory and excellency, in his perſon, doctrine, and operations, to the conviction and ſatisfaction of beleevers; for, <hi>he ſhall glorifie me.</hi> 3.

                  <p>From this to <hi>v.</hi> 23. is contained the ſecond encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, whereby Chriſt comforts his diſciples, and mitigates their exceſſive ſorrow for his departure. In this verſe the encouragement is more briefly propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48148:173"/>
That however he was ſhortly to be removed from them in reſpect of his bodily preſence, being now to ſuffer death, and leave the world; yet they ſhould ſhortly after that ſee him again, and he ſhould finde a way to be indeed preſent with them. For underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, albeit that reaſon of his going <hi>to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> may lead us to underſtand it of his appearing again to them bodily, after his reſurrection, and that ſince he was not to abide under the power of death, but to riſe again and aſcend to his Father; they ſhould get a ſight of him by the way; yet I take not this ſight to be underſtood here further, then as it was a forerunner of greater things. For this is to be done <hi>in that day,</hi> wherein they were to be endowed with much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to come much ſpeed in their prayers put up in his Name, <hi>v.</hi> 23. which is not to be reſtricted to that time betwixt his Death and Aſcenſion, but was rather verified after his Aſcenſion. And upon the ſame ground, albeit the enjoyment and ſight of Chriſt in heaven, (which every beleever may expect after a ſhort while) do indeed compleat that joy which is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>v.</hi> 20. as the fruit of their ſeeing of him; yet it is not to be reſtricted to that either. For in that day they will need no prayer, as <hi>v.</hi> 23. it is ſaid they ſhall in the day they ſhall ſee him. Therefore it is moſt clear to underſtand the encouragement thus, That however he was ſhortly to die and remove from them, yet ſeeing he was not to abide under the power of death, but to aſcend and be exalted with the Father; he would therefore give proof of his exaltation and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will toward them, by pouring out of his Spirit, whereby they ſhould enjoy a ſpiritual ſight of him, as <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 19. and by this their ſad houres ſhould be ſweetned (as alſo all beleevers) till they come to full ſight and full joy in heaven. Now albeit this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, thus explained, together with the reſt that follow, do all depend upon the pouring out of the Spirit, as fruits and benefits to be reaped thereby, as well as theſe that are formerly mentioned in this chapter. And ſo may all be reduced to that general encouragement, of the coming of the Holy Ghoſt; yet ſeeing Chriſt doth not here (as in the former) name this as a fruit of the Spirits coming, therefore I have made it a diſtinct encouragement. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The life of beleevers within time is made up, and conſiſts of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat variety of lots, having and wanting, ſweets and ſoures, mixed together, and ſucceeding one to another; for, ſo it is here declared, they are now ſeeing, ſhortly, not to ſee, and after that to ſee again. 2. The great exerciſe of beleevers, is about the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wanting a ſight of Chriſt; and this ſight of Chriſt is ſo precious to them, that it moves all the wheeles of their affections, and makes faire weather or foule, according as they want or enjoy it; it being ſtill winter when he is abſent, and whenever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, he brings the Spring with him; Therefore is all their exerciſe ſummed up in this, <hi>ye ſhall not ſee me,</hi> and, <hi>ye ſhall ſee me,</hi> and this is it which begets the joy and ſorrow after mentioned. 3. Whatever be Chriſts tender condeſcendence, at ſometimes, to his people; yet they are to expect that within time, they will get ſatisfaction to their ſenſe, but for a ſhort time; for, ſo did the diſciples finde its the matter of his bodily preſence, and ſo will beleevers finde in the matter of ſenſible enjoyments, <hi>a little while</hi> (being all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) or, but now a little while in reſpect of what they had enjoyed, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>and ye ſhall not ſee me.</hi> The word imports a ſerious and intent ſeeing and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating, and is attribute oft-times to a ſight of the minde; and it may inſinuate, that now they ſhould not get him ſeen ſo diſtinctly as formerly, or that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval ſhould ſo confound them for a time, as they ſhould not ſo much as get him contemplate with the eyes of their minde, till the Spirit come upon them. 4. It is the Will of Chriſt, that believers be not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with the withdrawing of Chriſt ſenſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but that in the midſt of enjoyments, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and be armed for it; Therefore, while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his company, he doth warne them, <hi>a little while, and ye ſhall not ſee me.</hi> 5. Chriſt when he doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his ſenſible and bodily preſence, is yet not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from believers, but hath a way of preſence, wherein ſpiritual minds may diſcern and ſee him; for, notwithſtanding his removal, <hi>ye ſhall ſee me,</hi> ſaith he. The word imports a full and clear ſight, as if he were before their eyes. 6. As the ſenſible enjoyments of beleevers are but ſhort, while they are within time, ſo their deſertions and clouds are but ſhort alſo; They may think the time long, becauſe of their affection, and they may prolong their own affliction, by taking in an idol in the room of an abſent Chriſt, and by not making uſe of deſertion as they ought; But he alloweth that their ſad houres be ſhort, and however it be, they are ſo in reſpect of eternity: for, <hi>again a little while, and ye ſhall ſee me,</hi> 7. Chriſts ſuffering for, and departing from his people, hath neither chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his affection to them, nor deprived him of ability to do for them; But they are the rather ſo much the dearer to him as the price of his ſufferings, and by his exaltation he is able to be powerfully preſent with them, by the pouring out of his Spirit; for, it is a reaſon of their ſeeing him, <hi>becauſe I go to the Father,</hi> having laid down the price of their Redemption.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe is contained Chriſts preface to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this encouragement; wherein, by making known that he underſtood their perplexity, and their deſire to be reſolved, he teſtifieth his willingneſſe to clear their doubt, and makes way for it, preventing their enquiry. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever be the perplexities of Saints, and their weakneſſe under them; yet they know Chriſt to be the only reſolver of their difficulties, and they cannot be at reſt till they get light; for, their enquiry among themſelves not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, it is ſubjoyned, notwithſtanding their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect carping, that <hi>they were deſirous to ask him,</hi> that ſo they might attain to light in the matter. 2. Albeit believers ſtand, oft-times, in ſenſible need of Chriſts help, and be deſirous thereof, yet they are kept back from employing of him partly, by their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bewray their own indigence; and partly, by reaſon of their ill-ordered reſpect to him, which keeps them at a needleſſe diſtance with him; for, albeit <hi>they were deſirous to ask him,</hi> yet they proceeded no further then a deſire, as being unwilling to bewray their ignorance, and reſpecting their Maſter ſo as they were afraid to ask him. 3. Chriſt is ſo infinitely omniſcient, and hath ſo vigilant an eye over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his people, as he knoweth and taketh notice of their ſecret doubts and perplexities, before they be propounded to him; for, <hi>Jeſus knew that they were deſirous to ask him,</hi> and by that queſtion, <hi>do ye enquire among your ſelves, &amp;c?</hi> he lets them ſee he knew their ſecret reaſonings and debates. 4. Chriſt will not caſt off his dull and weak followers, but their neceſſity hath a mouth of its own to his omniſcience and infinite love, whereof he will give proof by preventing their enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as here, however they were ignorant, and ſtood off from asking him, yet he prevents them with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their doubt. 5. When diſciples are about the uſe of ſome means, for reſolving of their doubts, Chriſt will in due time come and clear them; for, ſo much is imported in that he takes notice that they were <hi>enquiring among themſelves of that he ſaid;</hi> and while they were about that mean, he cometh and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them. 6. Albeit Chriſt do prevent his perplexed people, and do approve of their uſe of any lawful means; yet he accounts it ſtill a fault, that they ſhould not employ him in doubtful caſes; for, this queſtion, <hi>do ye enquire among your ſelves, &amp;c?</hi> doth not only import his notice-taking of their exerciſe, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof, in ſo far as they were not reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ignorance, but making uſe of that mean; but alſo, an indirect challenge that they ſhould enquire <hi>among themſelves,</hi> and not employ him.</p>

                     </gap>heir ſorrow ſhould end in joy. Which as it was verified to the diſciples in their joy after their ſad homes, for his ſuffering and removal; ſo it is alſo made good to beleevers in all ages, who have their joyes and ſorrows ſucceeding each other, but ſtill their joy laſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts doctrine to his followers, eſpecially concerning their allowed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort under and after ſorrow, is not empty and vain promiſes, but ſerious and ſolid truth; Therefore is it conformed here, and <hi>v.</hi> 23. with a double aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you.</hi> 2. It is the great fault of diſcouraged believers that they are ſlow of heart to believe Chriſts allowed encouragements; and yet it is moſt acceptable to him, that they give credit to them, and reſt upon them; for, this aſſeveration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not only the gravity of the matter, but further alſo, that we are averſe and unwilling to beleeve it, and that Chriſt is earneſt we ſhould give credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 3. It is very ſuitable that anſwerable affections go along with our conditions, and that our conditions be evidenced thereby; Therefore, doth he here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his being not ſeen, or ſeen, by them, <hi>v.</hi> 16. by their ſorrow and joy, as evidencing how they were affected with theſe diſpenſations. 4. As it is the lot of beleevers, to meet with ſorrow in the world; ſo Chriſts abſence and removal will be the chief cauſe of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48148:174"/>
moſt bitter ſorrow to them; Not that they are allowed to mourne without hope, but by their ſorrow for this they teſtifie their eſtimation of him, that nothing can be comfortable to them without him, and that they do keep his roome in their heart till he come again: And withal, when he is abſent, and their ſun down, they will meet with many dark clouds and ſharp ſhowers, to fill them with griefe; for, when they ſee not him, <hi>ye ſhall weep and lament,</hi> ſaith he. 5. The world are ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Chriſt and his people, that it is the time of their joy when Chriſt is removed, and the godly ſet down in ſorrow thereby for, theſe two go together, <hi>ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce.</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. 6. As it is the wretched diſpoſition of the world, to rejoyce in the want of Chriſt out of the world, and in the godlies affliction: So the Lord, in his holy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may ſometime permit them this advantage of rejoycing; partly, that it may adde to the exerciſe of his afflicted people; partly, that the diſpoſition of ſome wicked men may be diſcovered, who otherwiſe would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmoothly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34, 35 Partly, to let them ſee that when they have got their will for a time, yet it will not avail them; and partly to embitter their future ſorrow by theſe fits of joy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. For theſe cauſes it is that the Lord permits that <hi>the world ſhall rejoyce.</hi> So that ſuch advantages might be matter of terrour to them, if they looked rightly upon them. 7. Chriſt would not have his people pleaſing themſelves, with the dream of a conſtant calme, but ſeriouſly laying their account to meet with ſorrow and grief, for their exerciſe and trial, and to fit them for his joy; Therefore doth he again tell them, <hi>ye ſhall be ſorrowful.</hi> 8. As the wickeds joy is but for a moment, and goeth before a ſad ſtorme of ſorrow, which will be their luſt and final portion; So the ſorrows of the godly will end in joy, and joy will be the upſhot of all their griefes; yea, their preſent ſorrow ſhall afterward afford matter of joy: for, <hi>your ſorrow ſhall</hi> (not only end in, but) <hi>be turned into joy,</hi> as he turned water into wine.

                  <p>This explained encouragement is (in theſe verſes) illuſtrate from a ſimilitude taken from a woman in travel, which is propounded <hi>v.</hi> 21. and applyed <hi>v.</hi> 22. to this purpoſe, That as a woman in travel hath bitter pangs and ſorrows, &amp; yet all that is ſhortly ſwallowed up in the joy ſhe hath for the birth of a man-child; So however they were in ſorrow, yet his ſeeing them again ſhall afford them cordial and perminent joy.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord, in the ordinary courſe of his providence in the world, hath given ample proofe of his power and goodwill, and that he is able to bring bitter lots to a ſweet iſſue, whereof the godly ſhould make uſe, for their own encouragement in ſad lots: Therefore doth he lead them to comfort themſelves by the example of <hi>a woman in travail,</hi> and elſewhere he remits them to the conſideration of other his works in the world. 2. The godly may expect that their hours of ſorrow will be very ſharp and bitter, that ſo their trial may be compleat and ſearching; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is compared to the <hi>ſorrow of a woman in travail,</hi> as being very bitter, and nearer the birth, the ſharper, and ſuch as God only can open the womb and give an iſſue from it. 3. Their ſorrows alſo do reſemble that of a woman in travail, in reſpect that as this pain is the fruit of <hi>Evah's</hi> tranſgreſſion; So whatever be the Lords love, or ſcope in exerciſing his own, yet the Original and riſe of all their troubles, is ſin, and they are ſent to put them in minde what they are to chaſten, and humble them for by-paſt failings, or to mortifie the roots of ſin, and prevent it for the future. 4. It may contribute to ſweeten the bitter ſorrows of Saints, that they are as neceſſary to make way for the conſolations of Chriſt, as pangs are to make way for child-bearing; for, in this alſo the compariſon holds. 5. The ſorrows of Saints may be more eaſie to them, when they conſider that they are but for a ſet time, and by their violence and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are haſting to an iſſue; for, ſo a womans ſorrow is, <hi>when her hour is come,</hi> and but an hour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hich will paſſe over. 6. It is ample matter of hope and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſorrowful Saints, that their afflictions and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows will not only have an iſſue, but are bringing forth ſomewhat, that will be as a man-child brought forth by a travailing woman; for, ſo is here imported, that their afflictions are as a travailing in birth, bringing forth ſome fruit, and that they ſhall not miſcarry, but <hi>a man-child be born.</hi> 7. The fruit of Saints afflictions and ſorrows will be ſo full, as may ſwallow down all the bitterneſſe of their former trouble; for, in this alſo they reſemble a woman <hi>delivered of the child,</hi> who <hi>remembreth no more the anguiſh</hi> (that is, thinks nothing of it, though otherwiſe it be good to remember it for inſtruction) <hi>for joy that a man is born into the world,</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Beleevers ſorrow for the abſence of Chriſt is ſo great, that the very apprehenſion and intimation of his removal, begets ſorrow; for, <hi>now therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye have ſorrow,</hi> even before I be gone. 2. Chriſt doth take ſpecial notice of the ſorrow of his own, when it is for his ſake, and becauſe of his removal; for, he intimateth ſo much to them, <hi>ye now therefore have ſorrow.</hi> 3. The ſorrow of Saints for Chriſts ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will not be perpetual, but ought to be meaſured by the preſent <hi>now,</hi> as not knowing how ſoon he may put a period to it; for, ſo much alſo is imported in this, <hi>now ye have ſorrow, but I will ſee you again.</hi> 4. Kindly ſorrow of Saints can only be removed by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and their enjoying the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; And he will not ſtay away, but be at pains himſelfe to comfort ſuch; for, <hi>I will ſee you again,</hi> to remove your ſorrow. 5. It compleats the joy of mourning Saints, that not only they ſee Chriſt, but do know that he ſeeth them, and hath an eye of kindneſſe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48148:174"/>
toward them, and an eye of providence and care about them; Therefore in place of, <hi>ye ſhall ſee me,</hi> v. 16. it is here, <hi>I will ſee you again.</hi> 6. Albeit the joy of the godly may be interrupted for a time; yet it will never totally be extinguiſhed, but will revive after ſorrow; for, here is <hi>rejoycing</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er ſorrow. 7. It is Chriſts work, not only to afford matter of joy unto his people, but effectually to bear it in, for their encouragement; for, here he undertakes, <hi>ye ſhall rejoyce.</hi> 8. The joy of the godly doth far outſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The joy of beleevers is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent joy; whereof they ſhall never be totally deprived, till they enter into the Ocean of eternal joy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.21, 23. for, <hi>your joy no man taketh from you.</hi> It cannot be denyed but ſometime it is interrupted by their peeviſh refuſing of it, and by tentations taking it from them: But yet. 1. They want not ſtill ſome meaſure of joy, in ſo far as they are not totally diſcouraged. 2. They want not matter of joy, when themſelves do put it from them. 3. Tentations prevail to take away their joy, when they put not themſelves and it in Chriſts cuſtody; who here undertakes to make them rejoyce. 4. Whatever their wraſtlings and faintings be, yet they ſhall be carried through, till they come to obtain everlaſting joy, where ſighing and ſorrow ſhall flee away, and not be found, though they were ſought, whereas now we both ſeek and finde them too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe we have propounded the third and fourth encouragement, whereby Chriſt mitigates the exceſſive ſorrow of his diſciples becauſe of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them. The firſt of them is, that, in that day when the comforter ſhall come, they ſhall ſee him again, <hi>they ſhall ask him nothing.</hi> Which is not be underſtood of prayer, as if he would have them exempted from prayer, or that they ſhould not pray to him alone, but to the Father with him and through him. For the firſt of theſe is blaſphemous, and the ſecond not to the purpoſe, ſeeing it is not to be ſuppoſed they had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Father in their prayers formerly, and betaken themſelves only to him. Withal, the grave aſſeveration prefixed to the latter part of the verſe which ſpeaks of prayer, evidenceth that there he beginneth a new purpoſe, different from this here ſpoken of: And the word here rendred <hi>to ask,</hi> albeit it ſometime ſignifies to deſire or ſeek by prayer, and be ſo uſed by Chriſt ſpeaking of his own praying to the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 26. and often in <hi>chap.</hi> 17. Yet, 1. In the latter part of the verſe where he ſpeaks of their praying, he uſeth another word, which properly ſignifieth to ſeek by prayer, that ſo by the different words he might point out that the purpoſes are different. 2. The word here doth properly ſignifie, to <hi>ask queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or to propound doubtful things, whereof we are ignorant, that we may get reſolution in them; and ſo it is uſed in this ſame <hi>chap. v.</hi> 5, 19, 30. In relation to which paſſages, and to what is ſaid by way of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v.</hi> 25. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. I take this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to contain a promiſe of their illumination and growth in knowledge of the myſteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, propounded by way of oppoſition to their preſent neceſſity of asking many queſtions at him, in regard of their dulneſſe and ignorance. But now he promiſeth that, in that day they ſhall have more illumination than to make a doubt of every thing, and ſhould ask him nothing; which yet is not ſo to be underſtood, as if after the Comforter were come, there ſhould be no doubts, or that he would exempt them from a neceſſity of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon and employing of him for reſolution thereof; But it is to be underſtood comparatively, in reference to their preſent condition, That they ſhould not, as now they did, ſtick at every ſcruple, and be puzzled and perplexed about every purpoſe of divine truth, but ſhould be more familiarly acquainted with his doctrine. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Ignorance of divine myſteries is ſo great an affliction to diſciples, and illumination and knowledge thereof ſo great a mercy, as it may ſweeten ſad diſpenſations, and deſerveth a ſpecial remark, in their account; for, it is here an encouragement againſt his departure, and it is a day of remark <hi>(that day)</hi> to be delivered from their ignorance. 2. It is by the Spirit only that men are enabled to underſtand divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and this is more fully and clearly communicate by him in the dayes of the Goſpel, then formerly; for, it is <hi>in that day,</hi> when the Comforter cometh, that they ſhall <hi>ask nothing.</hi> 3. As Chriſt is very gracious to his people, in granting them ſenſe of neceſſities, and in ſupplying thereof when they come unto him; So he alſo tenders their weakneſſe by preventing them in many needs, and ſo prevents their many perplexities and anxieties, which otherwiſe they might be put to: Therefore is this promiſe thus propounded, <hi>ye ſhall ask me nothing,</hi> becauſe albeit it was enough to have him ready to reſolve their queſtions, when they put him to it, yet this was very hard to them, and therefore he, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them with a gift of knowledge. So, albeit he will never have his people freed from dependance on him, yet out of his reſpects to their weakneſſe, he gives ſenſe many viſible props, where faith is put to an exerciſe. He could feed the world immediately from heaven, as he did <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but ſince our weakneſſe would be ready to faint under ſuch a diſpenſation, therefore he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed another courſe.</p>
                  <p>The other encouragement here propounded, is, that they ſhall have ſucceſſe in their prayers put up in his name, concerning which compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 13, 14. and 15. 7. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The matter of hearing the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of beleevers is of great importance in Chriſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; And whatever our feares and tentations be about it, yet the verdict of his word is to be truſted to in that matter; Therefore doth he begin this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement with his uſual aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you.</hi> 2. There is no meaſure of enjoyment which beleevers have within time, which ſhould take them off from prayer and ſeeking; for, when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſes are accompliſhed, it is yet imported they muſt <hi>ask.</hi> 3. Times of much light have need of much
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48148:175"/>
prayer, to ſanctifie that light, and make it effectual for anſwerable ordering of our practice; for, <hi>in that day,</hi> when they ſhall get knowledge, and <hi>ask nothing,</hi> they muſt ſtill <hi>ask</hi> by prayer. 4. As the neceſſities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and the good things they expect, are many; So all their comfortable enjoyments muſt come by prayer: for, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask,</hi> imports that their prayers muſt be univerſal, reaching to all their felt needs and expected mercies. 5. Prayer muſt be offered up through Chriſt and in his name, as teſtifying the ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of our own unworthineſſe to come before God with our ſervices; our high eſtimation of Chriſts worth, merit, and credite with the Father, who can make our ſervices acceptable; and, our confidence that he will own us and our ſervices, and that the Father will be well pleaſed therewith in him; for, they muſt <hi>ask the Father in his name.</hi> 6. Prayer put up in Chriſts Name for things lawful, will get a good anſwer; And albeit the Lord will exerciſe our faith, to beleeve this when we ſee it not; our patience, to wait for it; and, our diſcerning to take up his wiſe contrivance of anſwering, when he ſuſpends the particular we deſire. And albeit he may alſo ſuſpend and deny anſwers, for a time, to particular ſutes, when either we are lying under unrepented guilt, or have neglected prayer till we come to a ſtrait, or have not ſenſe as we ought of what we ſeek; And alſo that he may try what mens deportment will be when their prayers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e not anſwered: Yet this is a truth of eternal verity, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> 7. Such as are given to prayer, and do receive anſwers thereunto from heaven, need not be diſcouraged for the want of Chriſts bodily preſence; ſeeing by the acceptance of their prayers in heaven, they will get conſtant proofes of his good will; for, this is an encouragement here againſt his removal, that they ſhall have intercourſe with him, by their praying and his anſwering. And indeed, to be frequent in prayer is the way to entertain the ſenſe of his love, and the want thereof begets jealouſies and coldrife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                     </gap>e. As for that he ſaith, <hi>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my Name,</hi> it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the diſciples and other godly perſons, had not prayed only before that time, or had not directed their prayers to God through the Mediatour: But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is partly, more generally, to point out the difference betwixt the way under the Law and under the Goſpel; In the one, their uſe making of a Mediatour in prayer was involved under many types and ſhaddows, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of the mercy ſeat, and though they directed their prayers to God through a Mediatour, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant, Yet it was without any particular application of that office of Mediatour unto the perſon of Jeſus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> as not being yet manifeſted. And it is not unlike that the diſciples and others, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoughts they had of Chriſt, Yet hitherto they had not ſo diſtinctly made uſe of him, in his office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, in the matter of prayer. But under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, eſpecially after the powring out of the Spirit, vails are taken away, and the Mediatour exhibited in perſon, to be diſtinctly and clearly made uſe of in prayer. Partly, the meaning is, more particularly, to point out the ſhort coming of the diſciples, who whatever uſe they made of Chriſt in prayer, yet had asked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing, in compariſon of what they were allowed to ask, and ſhould afterward receive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. We are ſo unwilling, upon the one hand, to pray, and Chriſt ſo willing to be employed, that he can never enough preſſe us to that duty; Therefore doth he inſiſt in preſſing them to <hi>ask,</hi> and is ſo forward in it, that he enlargeth it before the other encouragement mentioned before it, in the former verſe. 2. It is a notable encouragement unto prayer, that now under the Goſpel the perſon of the Mediatour is exhibited in our fleſh, acquainted with all our infirmities without ſin, and the way of employing him more diſtinctly and clearly held out, then under the Law; for, by this he excites them to ask, that <hi>hitherto they had asked nothing in his Name,</hi> but now might <hi>ask,</hi> as hath been explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. It may alſo encourage Saints to prayer, that let them ſeek never ſo much in his Name, yet he will be ſo far from reproaching them with his bounty, that he counts they have ſought nothing, in reſpect of what his love alloweth, and what he will do for them, if they ask; for, ſo much alſo (as hath been explained) is imported in this, <hi>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name,</hi> and therefore <hi>ask</hi> yet more, ſaith he. 4. It doth yet more encourage men to pray to God through Jeſus Chriſt, when they conſider, that his fair offers of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are not empty promiſes, but will be ſeconded with real performances; for, <hi>ask, and ye ſhall receive,</hi> ſaith he, appealing to their own experience, concerning the reality of his offers, if they will employ him. 5. Chriſt alloweth joy unto his people, to ſweeten and cry down the noiſe of all their diſcouragements and ſorrows; for, he alloweth they ſhould have joy, to aſſwage their griefe, becauſe of his departure. 6. The j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y allowed by Chriſt upon his people is a full and compleat joy, and groweth up by degrees, till they finde it ſo, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they make uſe of the means wherein it is to be found; Therefore doth he call it <hi>a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll joy,</hi> or, <hi>a joy fulfilled</hi> to their ſatisfaction, by their praying and his anſwering. 7. As the joy of beleevers cometh to them by the mean of prayer; So they are allowed joy even in their addreſſe-making to God through Chriſt, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what hope there is in ſuch in undertaking, and what a dignity and mercy it is, that ſuch as they ſhould be drawn to ſuch an employment, and admitted to ſerve in it; for, if <hi>joy</hi> be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> when they get an anſwer, then, certainly, it ſhould be begun while they are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 8. Such as purſue prayer in Chriſts Name, till they get an anſwer, will finde their joy thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48148:175"/>
as evidencing how glorious their head and ſurety Chriſt is, and how acceptable naughty perſons and performances are in heaven through him, and as putting a luſtre and double beauty upon every mercy, when it cometh that way out of the hand of God; for, <hi>ask,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full,</hi> or, <hi>fulfilled.</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond place, Chriſt inſiſts upon, and amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that encouragement which was firſt propounded, <hi>v.</hi> 23. concerning increaſe in knowledge. And as there he propounded the promiſe in oppoſition to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity of asking queſtions; So here it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in oppoſition to his preſent way of teaching, And that he would not ſpeak to them in proverbs, or, parables as formerly, but would fully and plainly reveal the Father to them. As for <hi>theſe things,</hi> which Chriſt ſaith he ſpake in proverbs, they are not to be reſtricted to the immediatly preceding purpoſe in this Chapter, but ſhould be more generally extended, to the moſt part of his doctrine hitherto particularly, in this laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; much whereof they did not underſtand, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their frequent objections, reaſonings, and queſtions. He ſaith, he hath ſpoken theſe things <hi>in proverbs,</hi> or, <hi>parables;</hi> whereby we are not to underſtand any dark or aenigmatick ſpeeches, as if his doctrine had been obſcure in it ſelfe; for his doctrine was plain in it ſelfe, and what he ſpake darkly to the multitude, he explained to them. But, the meaning is, partly, that much of that he ſpake, however it was clear in it ſelfe, yet to them it ſeemed as obſcure as if it had been all parables, and ſo appears from <hi>v</hi> 16, 17, &amp;c. but after the Spirits coming, he was to ſpeak plainly and fully, even in reſpect of their conception and underſtanding. Partly, that Chriſt in regard of their weakneſſe and incapacity, had but briefly touched many things, which would be but dark to them till the Spirit ſhould come, as <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. and had often made uſe of ſimilitudes and parables, in this Sermon, and at other times; whereby, albeit he condeſcended to their capacity, yet, (as he ſaith <hi>chap</hi> 3.12.) he ſpake but earthly things and not heavenly; that is, pointed out heavenly things by earthly reſemblances, which did eclipſe much of the luſtre theſe truths ſhould have, when he ſhould teach them plainly by his Spirit. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As cleareſt truths will be but dark myſteries, even to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, till the Spirit enlighten them; So Chriſt lets out light by degrees, and teacheth according to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples capacity; for, both theſe are held out in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you in proverbs.</hi> 2. It is the comfort of Saints, that what meaſure of light and inſtruction they need, and yet want at one time, it is but reſerved for another; for, it ſweetens their caſe to whom he had ſpoken in proverbs, that <hi>the time cometh when I ſhall no more ſpeak to you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in proverbs.</hi> 3. The clear and full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of ſaving truth was communicate by the Spirit to the Apoſtles, and by them to the Church; for, it is at that time, <hi>I ſhall ſhew you plainly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Father.</hi> 4. The great and fundamental doctrine of the Goſpel, revealed by the Spirit, is, the knowledge of God as the Father of Chriſt, and our Father in him; and conſequently, of the myſtery of Redemption; for, this is the doctrine he will teach, <hi>I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Father.</hi>

And that becauſe they have loved him and beleeved him, to be the Mediatour and Ambaſſadour come out from God For clearing of the Words, Conſider, 1. While Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I ſay not that I will pray the Father for you,</hi> the meaning is not that he will lay aſide his office of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for beleevers, which as they will ſtill need it, ſo it is a ſtrong pillar of their confidence, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Heb</hi> 4.15, 16. and 7.25. Neither is it only the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by this ſort of ſpeech he would moſt certainly aſſure them of it; it being a priviledge ſo ſure, as he needed not ſay more to aſſure them of it; As indeed his love is a real love, which hath more ſubſtance then ſhew. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it with what followeth in the beginning of the next verſe, we will find the meaning to be, That they had not only his interceſſion, but the Fathers love, upon which to ground their hope of audience; and, That he was not to intercede for them with the Father as with an enemie, or one unwilling to accept of them, being now reconciled; but, that the Father did love them, and out of his love to them had appointed him Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour. 2. While Chriſt ſercheth the reaſon of the Fathers love from their love to him, the meaning is not that their love to Chriſt did prevent the Fathers love to them, but that the Father having loved them and brought them to love Chriſt, doth reward this their love with more proofes of his love, in hearing their prayers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The prayers of Saints put up in Chriſts Name are ſo many waies welcome in heaven, as they cannot but be accepted; Therefore he aſſureth them of acceſſe, by ſhewing them how many things concurre to obtain acceſſe and an anſwer. 3. We ought ſo to eye Chriſts interceſſion, as we forget not alſo to aſcend up to the Fathers love, as rendering our perſons and prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; That double encouragements may make our

conſolation ſtrong, and, that we may not have wrong thoughts of the Father; for this cauſe, ſaith he, <hi>I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> 4. Such as are beloved of God, do get grace to flee to Chriſt, and to love him; for, <hi>ye,</hi> whom the Father loveth, <hi>have loved me.</hi> 5. As Gods love doth beget love in his people; ſo he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to reward and foſter this love with more of his love; for, <hi>the Father,</hi> (whoſe love prevents his people) <hi>loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me.</hi> 5. Love to Chriſt cannot be without faith, and where love is, it proves faith; for, <hi>ye have loved me, and beleeved.</hi> 6. True faith ought to cloſe with Chriſt as the great Embaſſadour of the Father, God and man, coming out from the Father by his Incarnation, and coming into the world, to work the work of our Redemption; for, <hi>ye beleeved that I came out from God:</hi> which includes the Fathers good-will in ſending of him, and proves his Godhead, in that he <hi>came from God,</hi> as well as the truth of his manhood was confirmed, by his appearing on earth, and his office to be the only Mediatour, as coming out from God for that effect. 7. Faith in Chriſt is ſo acceptable, that God will reward it with proofs of his free love; for <hi>the Father loveth you, becauſe ye beleeved that I came out from God.</hi>

Chriſt craves nothing to be believed by his people, but what is the real truth; for, as he commends them for believing that he <hi>came out from God, v.</hi> 27. ſo this is the very truth, <hi>I came forth from the Father, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the Embaſſadour of the Father; ſo he is true God equal with him; for, being with the Father, before his Incarnation, <hi>he came forth from the Father,</hi> and was not ſent only. 3. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt Jeſus, out of love to his people, to leave the Father and come into the world; not by being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Father, but by obſcuring his Deity and glory, under the vail of our fleſh, and ſinleſſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and converſing with us for working of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; for, ſo is this to be underſtood, <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world.</hi> 4. Chriſt, having perfected his work on earth, did leave the world, by aſcending up to heaven to perfect the work of our Redemption and ſalvation, where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his glory, having put off the vail of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for, <hi>again, I leave the world, and go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And by this he clears the matter of his removal to them, and lets them have a ſweet ſight of it. 5. As Chriſts coming into the world was voluntary, and flowed from his love, ſo was his departure alſo volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and he was not compelled thereunto by men; for, <hi>I am come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into the world,</hi> and, <hi>I leave it,</hi> and <hi>go.</hi> 6. The way of Chriſts coming and being into the world, may ſerve to clear contraverſies, concerning the matter of his removal; for, the one is here parallell'd with the other. And therefore, as his coming was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and in a bodily way, ſo alſo is his removal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and takes away his bodilie preſence. And as his humanity and body were not in heaven, while he was in the world: ſo it is not here now, after that he is gone to the Father.</p>

                  <p>In theſe and the two following verſes, is contained the third part of the chapter, wherein Chriſt doth give a meet entertainment to their faire profeſſion of profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and faith concerning him. Theſe verſes contain their profeſſion; wherein, 1. Being ſatisfied with his former way of doctrine, they profeſſe that he ſpake plainly, and without proverbs, and conſequently, that they had made proficiencie and underſtood him. 2. They deduce two inferences from this, teſtifying their further proficiencie, beſide the underſtanding of what he ſaid, 1. That by his preventing their queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 19. they were perſwaded of his omniſcience, and that none needed to informe him of their caſe by queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if he were ignorant thereof. 2. That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of this his omniſcience, did further confirme them in the faith of his Deity. Now concerning this profeſſion, as it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but there is ſome good in it, and they had ſound faith, which Chriſt acknowledgeth, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and they had already profeſſed it, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.69. ſo when we conſider Chriſts entertainment thereof, we will finde ſome exceſſe of preſumption in it; for, albeit Chriſt did indeed ſpeak plainly, yet the time was not come, wherein he had promiſed they ſhould ask him nothing, <hi>v.</hi> 23. And therefore they preſumed more of their knowledge, then they had cauſe; and albeit they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that truth, that he came forth from God, and that upon ſolid ground; yet their faith was not full enough, ſince they had not employed their faith about the matter of his removal, which he had preſſed upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever divine truth Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak more obſcurely in one place, it will be found fully cleared and explained elſewhere; for, <hi>now,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſpeakeſt thou plainly, and ſpeakeſt no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi> 2. It is a great comfort to Chriſts followers to underſtand his Word, and it is the propertie of divine truths, that when they are apprehended in any meaſure, they do wonderfully affect and refreſh the heart; for, ſay they, by way of admiration, <hi>lo, now ſpeakeſt thou plainly, &amp;c.</hi> being wonderfully refreſhed with the light they received. 3. Chriſt will be found omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by all them who know him rightly; for, <hi>we are ſure that thou knoweſt all things, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Preventing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48148:176"/>
means give his people but little to do, and are very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting when they are found; for, it held in their pains, and did very much affect them, that he gave proof, <hi>he needed not any man ſhould ask him.</hi> 5. Chriſt doth then become very precious to hearts, when he by his Word meets with what is in their hearts; for, this did raviſh them, that <hi>he needed not be asked,</hi> but lighted upon what was in their thoughts, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 6. Chriſt is then rightly taken up in his properties, when he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be God, and when faith cloſeth with him as ſuch; for, it followeth on the former, <hi>By this we beleeve thou cameſt forth from God.</hi> 7. When weak beginners get any meaſure of knowledge or faith, they are in peril to run upon the extremities of raſhneſſe, and preſumptuous conceit; for, with this was their profeſſion here hinted, wherein they ſpeak, as if they had attained to a full meaſure, and needed not depend on the promiſe of the Spirit. 8. When we try the ſolidity of our faith, we ſhould look eſpecially to its ground, whether it be the ſolid Word of God, or ſome extraordinary work only, which may affect for a time, but not prove conſtant enough; for, in this their profeſſed faith was faulty, that it was begotten, rather by the act of his proving his omniſcience, then by the Word. 9 We may have very low thoughts of our own faith, as its beſt, when we conſider the many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, and how far ſhort it cometh; for, in this their faith was faulty, that however they beleeved <hi>he came forth from God,</hi> yet their faith fell ſhort in what was their preſent exerciſe, concerning his return to the Father.</p>

                  <p>Theſe verſes contain Chriſts entertainment of this Profeſſion; wherein, taking hold of their profeſſion of faith in ſo far as it was real, and checking their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and carnal confidence therein, (for both theſe are imported in that queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 31.) he warneth them, that their faith ſhould get a trial, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption a ſad ſhake very ſhortly, when at his trial they ſhould be ſcattered, and put to ſhift for themſelves, leaving him alone, who yet ſhould not be alone, having the Father with him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt takes notice of no effect his doctrine produceth, unleſſe faith be one, and a chief effect; for, of all they ſaid, he takes notice of that, as of greateſt importance, if it had been ſuch as they thought it was, <hi>do ye beleeve?</hi> 2. When men have attained to ſome meaſure of faith, they may have yet cauſe to be humbled, that they have been ſo long in learning that leſſon; for, <hi>do ye now</hi> (and not till now) <hi>beleeve?</hi> 3. Chriſt takes notice of mens attaining to any meaſure of faith, that he may put them to work; for, <hi>do ye now believe,</hi> is a taking hold of what they grant, that now he may put them to that exerciſe mentioned afterward, which before could not ſo conveniently be done. 4. Chriſt doth hate preſumption and carnal confidence, were it even in his deareſt people; for, this queſtion doth alſo import his diſdaining of their preſumption, and that he would ſhortly give them a proof how far they were miſtaken. 5. As when men are enabled to beleeve, they ought to look for work; ſo preſumption mixed with faith, doth portend a winnowing ſtorme, and that near at hand; for, <hi>do ye now beleeve? the houre cometh, yea, is now come,</hi> even that ſame night, <hi>that ye ſhall be ſcattered, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Preſumption is a diſeaſe not eaſily cured by any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and warning from the Word, till the preſumptuous finde his own weight in trial: for, this muſt refute it, <hi>an houre of ſcattering.</hi> 7. Though Chriſt be moſt tender of the broken ſpirits of his people, and of their ſad condition, yet he will not ſpare to humble them, when preſumption is aloft, were their condition other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe never ſo ſad; for, when he is comforting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his departure, he hath yet a ſad word to check their preſumption. 8. The doctrine of trials is oft-times but careleſly heard by preſumptuous men, and they may meet with that which they little ponder; Therefore, a <hi>behold</hi> is prefixed to this doctrine. 9. The trials of Chriſt and his followers, as they are violent, ſo are they determined by God, and ſhort; for, it is <hi>an houre,</hi> a bitter houre indeed, but a determined and ſhort houre; and therefore we ſhould take heed an houre produce not that, which may ſhame us for ever. 10. Continued-in preſumption and carnal confidence, will undoubtedly cauſe men to fall, when trial cometh, were they even Chriſts own dear children; for, here the enſuing ſtorme is deſcribed, from the ſad effect it ſhould produce in them, <hi>of ſcattering and leaving him.</hi> And if we conſider their true grace, their ſpecial and intimate acquaintance with Chriſt, the many proofes of favour conferred on them, the many proofs they got and ſaw of his divine power, their ſingular engagements to Chriſt, and, their being forewarned of their danger: If, I ſay, we conſider theſe things, and that yet they fall, it may let us ſee that nothing will bear out men, if deſerted, or given up to the power of preſumption. 11. Scattering, and the diſſipation of the ſocieties of Gods people is one of the ſad fruits of perſecution; for <hi>ye ſhall be ſcattered every man.</hi> 12. Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering is then not only our affliction, but our ſin and weakneſſe, when trouble and hazard makes us ſelfiſh, and ſeek to ſhift for our ſelves, little conſidering the hazard of the intereſt of Chriſt; for, this followes on their preſumption, <hi>ye ſhall be ſcattered every man to his own,</hi> that is, not only going to their own home, as afterward they did, but their ſhifting for themſelves, when they <hi>leave</hi> their Maſter <hi>alone</hi> in the garden. 13. It is a part of the trial of honeſt ſufferers, that in their ſharpeſt conflicts, they may be deſerted, even of them who not only make faire profeſſions, but have real honeſty, and may be left in the gap there alone; for, herein Chriſt hath paved the way, who was <hi>left alone;</hi> And albeit none could joyne with him in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during theſe ſufferings, whereby he redeemed his people; yea, albeit his care was to have them exempted, <hi>chap.</hi> 18.8. yet it was a trial and exerciſe unto him, to be thus left alone. 14. Let never ſo many deſert Chriſt and his truth, yet he will own and ſtand to it; for, he is <hi>left alone,</hi> and yet ſtands alone in that conflict.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48148:177"/>
15 The condition of ſufferers is not ſo deſolate and ſolitary, as ſpectators or ſenſe at firſt view would judge; for, <hi>though they leave him alone, yet I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> ſaith he. 16. God may be purſuing his own dear children in great diſpleaſure, with whom he is yet gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſent, upholding them with the one hand; as he ſmites with the other; for, <hi>the Father is with me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, when yet the Father is purſuing him hotly for the ſins of the Elect, and deſerting him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. 17. The preſence of God alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſuſtain a ſoul, when deſerted of all under ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt difficulties: for, though ye <hi>leave me alone, yet I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe is contained a concluſion, not only of the immediatly preceding purpoſe, or chapter, but, of the whole farewel Sermon; wherein, having ſpoken many and divers things to them, wherewith they were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected, he ſheweth that his ſcope in all of it was to promove their peace in him. The neceſſity whereof appeareth from the troubles they ſhall meet with in the world; And the efficacie of his peace, to counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the bitterneſſe of worldly trouble, is held out, partly, in the effect thereof, that having peace, they may be of good cheer, or bold; and partly, in the ground of this courage, that Chriſt hath overcome the world. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As peace is Chriſts allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his people, ſo the drift of all he ſpeaks to them, tends to promove their good and peace; his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brangling of their preſumption, and warning them of dangers, tends not to take away their confidence in his good will, nor to brangle their peace, but to excite them to make it ſurer; for, <hi>Theſe things</hi> (in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in the immediately preceding warning) <hi>have I ſpoken unto you, that ye might have peace.</hi> 2. It is Chriſt only who can give and ſpeak peace to his people; for, <hi>I have ſpoken that ye might have peace.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. 3. The peace of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers is begotten by the Word, as faith is; and it takes root there; ſo that while the Word is for them, they need not be diſmayed; for, upon this, <hi>I have ſpoken,</hi> doth this follow, <hi>that ye might have peace.</hi> 4. The peace of God conferred upon beleevers, is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift, and ſufficient though they have no more; as being the fruit of juſtification and reconciliation; as being that which gives a deliverance in the midſt of troubles; which will guard hearts in midſt of violent blaſts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. which will make men keep from ſinful courſes, which would diſturb their peace, more effectually, then the apprehenſion of wrath and hell; and, which ſtayes the minde on God in the midſt of inward ſhakings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. For theſe reaſons is all their allowance from Chriſt comprehended under the name of <hi>peace.</hi> 5. It is in Chriſt alone that we have right or acceſſe to any true peace, and in him we muſt entertain it; for, ſaith he, <hi>that in me ye might have peace.</hi> 6. Peace with God through Chriſt will not keep men from blaſts of outward trouble, but the one is conſiſtent with the other; yea, the worlds hatred will readily follow on Chriſts friendſhip; for, when <hi>in me ye have peace, in the world ye ſhall have tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 7. Saints may not only expect trouble from the world, but that their trouble ſhall be very preſſing and ſearching; for, <hi>ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> or, <hi>a preſſing diſtreſſe,</hi> as the word imports. 8, Even the deareſt of Saints are obnoxious to tentations, of fainting, fear, and diffidence, when ſharp trouble aſſaults them; for, they will need a word of encouragement, <hi>be of good courage.</hi> 9. No outward trouble ought to diſturb Saints peace, but their peace with God ought to appear in couragious and confident encountring with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for, after his allowed peace, <hi>in the world ye ſhall have tribulation, but be of good cheer,</hi> or, <hi>bold,</hi> ſaith he. 10. The world and all things therein, that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Saints, are vanquiſhed and overcome by Chriſt upon the croſſe: ſo that they may well teſtifie, but cannot hurt them; for, <hi>I have overcome the world.</hi> 11. Chriſts victory over the world is ground of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all his ſuffering people, againſt the power and policy of the world; conſidering, that however Chriſt will not exempt them from a battel and exerciſe, yet they are partakers of his victory by faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. and ſhall (abiding in him) finde, in end, that they have to do with enemies already vanquiſhed; for, ſaith he, <hi>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</hi>

               <p>The Chapter may be taken up in three parts: In the firſt, He prayeth for himſelf, that the Father would glorifie him; preſſing the ſame by Arguments, taken not only from the ſweet relation betwixt the Father and him, but more expreſſely, from the time wherein he asketh this, from his glorifying the Father, being glorified by him, <hi>v. 1.</hi> from his calling and charge to give eternal life to the Elect, <hi>v. 2, 3.</hi> and, from his fidelity in his Charge and Commiſſion, <hi>v. 4.</hi> upon which he repeats and explaines his petition, by way of concluſion, <hi>v. 5.</hi> In the ſecond

                  <p>In this verſe, (after a ſhort tranſition, intimating a connexion betwixt the former doctrine and this prayer, and a declaration of his poſture in prayer with his eyes lift up to heaven) is contained, 1. A propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his petition for himſelf, that the Father would glorifie him, of which more on <hi>v.</hi> 5. only in ſumme, it imports his deſire that God would glorifie him; by ſuſtaining him in his approaching agony, that in it he might triumph over all his and his peoples enemies, by proving him to be the Son of God, even in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as he did by many miracles at his death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.45, 46, 51, 52, 53.

Some of the reaſons preſſing this petition: one is couched in that ſweet relation betwixt: the Father and him, implied in the titles of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son.</hi> But there are more expreſſely ſubjoyned, 1. A reaſon taken from the time, wherein he asketh this, that <hi>the houre is come,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the houre of his agony, wherein he expected ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to be glorified, according as he would need, and was promiſed to him in the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89, 21, 22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. and 50.8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31. As alſo upon the back of that, the houre of his promiſed exaltation, having waited his time, and done the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the forme of a ſervant. 2. Another reaſon taken from a conſequent of granting his deſire, and his end in propounding of it; namely, that the Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him, he might alſo glorifie the Father, whoſe glory ſhines in the glory of his Son, and in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſufferings and ſucceſſe. From all which, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Prayer to God is a ſpecial mean to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers lively in all duties, and to make the Word and all our endeavours effectuall for that end; for, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus,</hi> in preaching, and then ſubjoynes prayer for a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt is ſo real in his love to his people, that he will ſay nothing to them for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, but what he will ſay of them and for them, in his compeering before the Father on their behalf; Therefore, having <hi>ſpoken theſe things</hi> to them, wherein he had let out much of his heart and love to them, he doth now confirm the ſame, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much of them to God, hereby aſſuring them that he would be the ſame in abſence, that he was when preſent. 3. As it is the duty of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſtudy alwayes ſpiritual mindedneſſe; to ſet their affections upon things above, and to viſit their faire inheritance, by ſending their affections thither, till themſelves follow after; ſo, in particular, it is their duty in prayer, to row<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by this poſture did teſtifie the heavenly and depending frame of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 4. Albeit the Lord know the moſt ſecret deſires of the heart, and do reſpect and hear the very thoughts of his people; yet it is their duty, as they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to make uſe of their tongue in prayer, that ſo they may do him homage with the whole man; may, by that means, (among others) excite their own affections in prayer; and may edifie others in their place and ſtation, for ſome (at leaſt) of theſe cauſes it is, that Chriſt in prayer ſpake in the audience of his diſciples, <hi>he lift up his eyes, and ſaid</hi> and by his practice and example would teach us our duty, 5. Prayer is a notable mean for carrying men through in trials; And Chriſt hath ſanctified it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his followers to make uſe thereof, by employing of it as his weapon in his greateſt extremity and need, and that upon grounds of common intereſt; that ſo in all things he might be like his brethren; for, here in the apprehenſion of his approaching agony, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to prayer on his own behalf, uſing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of intereſt common to him, with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt, in his ſaddeſt ſufferings, was ſtill glorious in himſelf, and appeared ſo to the conviction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and all his ſufferings are now crowned and ſhut up in great glory; for, now and ſhortly after, was <hi>the Son glorified.</hi> 8. God hath it abſolutely in his hand,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48148:178"/>
to conferre glory and honour upon his ſuffering chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to glorifie himſelf in them, ſo that none can impede him in it; for, ſaith he, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son.</hi> 9. Albeit Saints need not perſwade God to grant what they ask agreeable to his Will; yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they uſe arguments in prayer; that they may aſſure their own hearts may evidence their confidence, to his glory; and, may teſtifie their inſtancy in ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their ſuites; Therefore doth Chriſt preſſe his petition with ſo many reaſons. 10. Intereſt in God, and familiarity with him, are of great uſe in a day of ſtrait, and are the wheels upon which prayer to God will move ſweetly; Therfore, doth Chriſt couch this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in the boſome of his prayer, that God is his <hi>Father,</hi> and he his <hi>Son,</hi> to teach us, to make that intereſt ſure, which may beget ſo much confidence in prayer in a day of need, ſeeing a father can deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good to a childe, nor will many words be needed to a father, when the childe is in diſtreſſe. 11. Chriſt ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever be the excuſes of Saints in ordinary; yet they may ſtill expect that needful and promiſed proofes of love will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in the houre of their diſtreſſe, and that honeſt prayers will avail much, when diſtreſſe is great, and nothing left but prayer; for, now when <hi>the hour</hi> (or the ſet time appointed for his ſuffering) <hi>is come,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to prayer, confidently expecting that then the <hi>Father will glorifie his Son.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. 13, The only way to come ſpeed at Gods hands in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining promiſed mercies, is, patiently to wait his time, ſubmitting to be exerciſed, in our faith, audience, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubjection to him, till the houre of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance come; for, Chriſt having a promiſe of being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, not only in, but after his ſufferings, doth quietly continue under the forme of a ſervant, till now <hi>the houre is come,</hi> wherein God had promiſed to glorifie him. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. 14. As Gods being a Father gives ſweet ground of encouragement in prayer to his children: ſo it is an evidence of Sonſhip, when they have cleanly aims in their prayers, and are led to make ſweet uſe of the anſwer of prayer; for, ſo Chriſt clears his Sonſhip from his aime in this ſuit, and the uſe he purpoſed to make of it, <hi>that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee.</hi> 15. To be cleanly in our aim in prayer, and make honeſt uſe of the anſwer thereof, is the way to come much ſpeed in prayer; for, this is an argument p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It may aſſure beleevers, that their well-being will bear much ſway in heaven, when they conſider that both the Father and Son are glorified therein; That the Son is glorified, in being carried through in ſuffering for them, and in perfecting their Redemption, and in triumphing over all their enemies, and that the Father is glorified in thus glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Son; Therfore is this ſpoken in the audience of his diſciples, to encourage them, by hearing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sons glory ſo much concerned in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In this verſe is contained a third expreſſe Argument preſſing his petition; it is taken from the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and that the Father had given him authority over all perſons, to order and diſpoſe of them ſo, as he might bring about the ſalvation of the Elect. And therefore he deſires to be glorified, that he may be anſwerable to that truſt: That the Father would bear him through in ſuffering, that ſo he may purchaſe eternal life to them, and would glorifie him after his ſufferings, in his exaltation in heaven, that he might perfect his work, and exerce that power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and apply his purchaſe, for the actual ſalvation of the Elect. So the Argument contains a ſecond ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate end which he propounds in his prayer, namely, the glorification of the Elect, which alſo is a mean of his glorifying of the Father, who delights to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their ſalvation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is Chriſts great care, next unto his Fathers glory, to diſcharge his truſt faithfully, in order to the eternal welfare of his own; Therefore doth he make it an Argument why the Father ſhould glorifie him, that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this truſt. 2. Such as are entruſted and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, may expect that he will not deſert them in the diſcharge of their truſt, when they come and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him by humble confident prayer; for, Chriſt in prayer expects, that the Father, <hi>as he hath given him this power, &amp;c.</hi> will glorifie him, that he may do what is committed to him. 3. Chriſt, even as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, hath ſoveraign power and authority over all things, ſo that they are but frail <hi>fleſh</hi> before him, and he may diſpoſe of them as he will: for, there is <hi>power,</hi> or, <hi>authority, over all fleſh, given to him</hi> by the Father, or a donative power and Kingdom as Mediatour. He reſtricts this power to <hi>all fleſh,</hi> not ſecluding all other things which are under his power, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>and</hi> 28.18. <hi>John</hi> 3.35. but comprehending them under thoſe, as being the great viſible obſtructers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples happineſſe. 4. Beſide the power given unto Chriſt over all creatures, there are a certain number of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48148:178"/>
men given by the Father unto Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, that he may redeeme, take charge of, and be forth coming for them: for, there are here ſome thus <hi>given him,</hi> of which more, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

Life eternal is that which Chriſt intends for his people, and he will never reſt ſatisfied, till he crown his other mercies to them with putting them in poſſeſſion thereof; for, it is his aime here, to <hi>give etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> 6. Life eternal is a gift peculiar only to the Elect who are given to Chriſt, and is conferred only upon them, and upon all of them; for, <hi>he gives eternal life to as many,</hi> or, <hi>to all thou haſt given him,</hi> and to none elſe. 7. Whatever be the gracious endowments conferred upon the Elect within time, yet eternal life is a free gift unto them; for, <hi>he give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> eternal life to as many at thou haſt given him.</hi> 8. It may confirme the Elect, who are drawn to Chriſt, in the certain expectation of eternal life, that the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation thereof is committed unto Chriſt their Head and Surety; for, <hi>thou haſt given him authority, that he ſhould give eternal life.</hi> 9. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is in Chriſt ſufficient ground of confidence, that he will ſave his own, whatever difficulties be in the way. He hath not only ſufficient merit to purchaſe it, and wiſdome, fidelity, love and care, to guide them in the way to it; but power alſo to draw them in and hold them in, and power over all things that might impede or promove their ſalvation, to diſpoſe of them ſo, as they may be ſubſervient to that great work: for, <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The former argument is further explained, by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what life eternal is; Namely, a ſaving knowledge of God, as the only true God in his eſſence and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in oppoſition to idols, and a knowledge of him as he is manifeſted in Chriſt, the Fathers Ambaſſadour; which is both the way and mean of attaining eternal life, and the beginning of it, while it is known by faith here, and eternal life hereafter ſhall conſiſt in the full ſight &amp; fruition thereof. For further clearing of this purpoſe, Conſider. 1. Chriſts ſcope in inſerting this explication in his prayer, is not to informe the Father; but partly, to informe the diſciples, for whoſe edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he thus prayed in their audience; partly, to preſſe the argument ſtrongly: for the glorifying of Chriſt to give eternal life ſhould glorifie the Father, by his being known and acknowledged by beleevers; and it was needful Chriſt ſhould be ſupported in his agony, and afterward exalted to give eternal life, ſeeing eternal life conſiſted only in knowing God in his Chriſt. Conſider, 2. While Chriſt propounds the Father to be <hi>the only true God,</hi> the meaning is not to ſeclude himſelf and the holy Spirit from being the true God alſo, one in eſſence, and equal in power and glory with the Father. For that is a truth fully aſſerted throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. and elſewhere; and in the ſame prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Chriſt is ſaid to have <hi>had glory with the Father, before the world was;</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, there was nothing ſubſiſting to have glory or any other thing, but only the true God; and ſo Chriſt, with the Holy Ghoſt, muſt be true God alſo. But for clearing of the words, we would conſider that this excluſive, <hi>only,</hi> is not joyned with the word, <hi>Father,</hi> as if it ran thus, <hi>Only the Father is the true God,</hi> but it runs with the words that follow, <hi>the only true God.</hi> And ſo when it is ſaid, the Father is <hi>the only true God,</hi> the meaning is, that God, or the deity which ſubſiſts in the perſon of the Father, is the only true God, or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, in oppoſition to all idols and ſuppoſed deities, not ſecluding the other perſons in whom that true Godhead ſubſiſts alſo, ſeeing the eſſence is one in all the three, and every one of them are that only true God. Withal, for confirmation of this, it would be conſidered, that in Scripture there are ſuch words of reſtriction made uſe of, in things aſcribed to one or other perſon of the Godhead, which yet are not to be taken abſolutely, as ſecluding the reſt of the perſons, but only in relation to the creatures; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. it is ſaid, <hi>None</hi> (as it is in the Original) <hi>knoweth the Sonne, but the Father,</hi> or, <hi>the Father, but the Son,</hi> &amp;c. in both which aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not to be ſuppoſed that <hi>the Son,</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> are ſecluded from knowing themſelves, though the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the one be aſcribed only to the other; but it is to be underſtood that no creatures know the one or the other, untill the Son reveal them. Nor is <hi>the Spirit</hi> either ſecluded from knowing the Father and Son, by theſe expreſſions, ſeeing he <hi>ſearcheth, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. but only the creatures. So here, take this reſtriction as we will, and it ſecludes not the Son and Spirit from being that true God, but only ſheweth that idols are not that true deity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The happineſſe of beleevers would be much ſtudied by them, wherein it conſiſts, and what is the way to it; And for this end, there is need of Chriſts own teaching; Therefore doth he take occaſion, for their edification, to inſert this deſcription of life eternal. 2. It may ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beleevers condition unto them, when they conſider how much the Father and Son do intereſſe themſelves in their happineſſe; Therefore doth he propound their eternal happineſſe. as a thing wherein both of them are ſo much concerned, as hath been explained. 3. The eſtate unto which beleevers are and will be advanced by Chriſt, is a ſtate of life, and only worthy of that name; any other eſtate beſide, being but a ſtate of death; Therefore doth he call it <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>life eternal,</hi> even as it is begun here. See <hi>Act.</hi> 5.20. where it is called <hi>this life,</hi> by way of excellency. And for our aſſurance of an intereſt in this ſtate, we ſhould be ſenſible of our being dead without it, and ſenſible of what annoyeth this life, when we have received it; we would ſeek after food ſuteable for entertaining of our life, and be active in ſuch motions and duties, as do ſlow from the principle of ſuch a life. 4. Whatever other life men live, yet it
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48148:179"/>
is but fading, their beſt dayes, vanity, and few, and evil; But it is the happineſſe of beleevers, that their begun-life is everlaſting, and will be perfected in glory; for, it is <hi>life eternal.</hi> 5. Eternal life, as it is begun here, and the way to attain to the full enjoyment thereof in heaven, conſiſts in the knowledge of God, as it includes faith in him, and ſutable affections and practice; for, <hi>This is life eternal, that they might know thee,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſts not in a bare act of the underſtanding, but takes the will and affections alongſt with it. 6. It is neceſſary to the ſaving knowledge of God, that he be taken up as God, in his nature and attributes, as he hath revealed himſelfe; and that he be known to be really and truly that which he reveals himſelfe to be; for, they muſt know him <hi>God,</hi> and, <hi>the true God.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be many things cried up as god in the world, and in mens eſtimation; Yet they are but vanities and lies, and only Jehovah is the true God; And they who know him ſavingly, will acknowledge him as ſuch, renouncing and crying down all idols, all delights and confidences, beſide; for, he is <hi>the only true God;</hi> and they muſt <hi>know,</hi> and acknowledge him as ſuch. 8 Whatever knowledge of God men attain unto, as the true God, in oppoſition unto idols; Yet that will not be ſufficient unto ſalvation, unleſſe Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour be known alſo, and God in him and in his diſpenſation of grace, in ſending him into the world: Therefore are theſe conjoyned here, to <hi>know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> 9. To know Chriſt ſavingly, or to ſalvation, is to know him, as in his perſon and natures, ſo, in his offices and the truſt committ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A fourth argument preſſing the petition, is taken from his fidelity in diſcharging the truſt committed to him, in that he had glorified the Father, by accompliſhing the work which was laid upon him to do; Upon which (in the next verſe) he repeats his ſute. He ſaith, <hi>I have finiſhed the work:</hi> for, albeit in heaven he be ſtill working for us, and working that which was given him by the Father to do, namely, in ſo far as concerns the application of his merit for the actual ſalvation of the Elect, Yet the work of Reconciliation (as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.) or, of purchaſing Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was given him to be done on earth, and he finiſhed it there. And albeit he had not as yet, when he prayed this, finiſhed all that was given him; yet he might well ſay this becauſe he had finiſhed all that was hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requiſite to be done, and had in his will and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gone through all that was yet before him, and was ſhortly to performe all things till he might ſay, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> chap. 19.30. In reference to which he makes this profeſſion. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. None are ſent into the world to be idle, but have a task and ſervice laid upon them, of their general calling and particular ſtation; for, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe had <hi>work</hi> on earth. 2. We cannot acceptably ſerve our generation, nor will God accept any work we do, unleſſe his glory be our chief aime in it; for, <hi>I have glorified thee,</hi> ſaith he, in this work. 3. To glorifie God is ſo much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as it is not ſuſpended till we come to heaven, where we may do it without interruption; but is ſet about on earth, where ſo few minde that work, and where there are ſo many difficulties and tentations to divert us; for, it contributes to commend his ſervice, that <hi>I have glorified thee on earth,</hi> ſaith he. 4. Chriſt, by his preaching, miracles, ſufferings, and obedience to the death, and his whole converſation, and frequent aſcribing of the great things he did, to his Father, did glorifie him, and demonſtrate his power, truth, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, juſtice, mercy, and other attributes: for, ſaith he, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth.</hi> Which may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage beleevers, that their ſurety hath ſerved God ſo acceptably. 5. Such as have been ſincerely aiming at Gods glory, will ſtill be endeavouring to glorifie him more and more; for, he who had <hi>glorified him on earth,</hi> propounds it, <hi>v.</hi> 1. as his aime ſtill, <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As God is glorified by mens work and actings, and not by bare profeſſions only; So God is the impoſer of mens tasks upon them, and he will be glorified by no works of men, but what are by himſelfe aſſigned to them in their ſtations; for, <hi>I have glorified thee,</hi> in <hi>the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> 7. Men muſt not only begin, but perfect alſo their work unto the end, before they receive a full reward; for, ſo much doth his example teach, <hi>I have finiſhed the work.</hi> 8. Chriſt did nothing on earth, in working out our Redemption, but what was the will of the Father, and by him committed unto him; for, his work was <hi>the work which he gave him to do.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. So that Chriſt working it, and it being the will of the Father, it muſt be acceptable. 9. There was nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Chriſt by the Father, to be done on earth, for the purchaſing of our Redemption, but he did finiſh it: So that the debt is payed, juſtice ſatisfied, and ſin, Satan and death ſpoiled, ſo that nothing remains now but the application of his purchaſe, and communication of that to his people which they already have in him their Head; for the doing whereof he is now exalted and glorified; for, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me.</hi> 10. Such as expect a comfortable iſſue of their life, and deſire to make a comfortable Teſtament, ought to make it their chief care to glorifie God, in going inceſſantly about his ſervice in their ſtation, till they finiſh their courſe; for, herein Chriſt hath left us a pattern, who being to ſeek to be glorified with the Father after his death, <hi>v.</hi> 5. hath here this ſweet teſtimony, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:48148:179"/>In this verſe Chriſt repeats and explains his petition, by way of concluſion following upon the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Wherein he reſtricts the former general petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be glorified, <hi>v.</hi> 1, to the enjoyment of that glory he had before the world was, as preſuppoſing his being glorified in being born through in his ſufferings, and including, by way of conſequence, the manifeſtation of his glory in his ſpiritual Kingdome in the world. The ſumme of the petition, is, that ſince he had finiſhed his work on earth, therefore the Father would advance him to the poſſeſſion of that glory he enjoyed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For clearing whereof, we are to conſider, that as Chriſt was from all eternity, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, ſo we are not to conceive of any real change in this glory of his Godhead, as if by his eſtate of humiliation, he had ſuffered any diminution, or by his ſtate of exaltation, any real acceſſion were made to his glory, as God. But the meaning is, That Chriſt, having (according to the paction paſt betwixt the Father and him) obſcured the glory of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for a time, under the vail of the forme of a ſervant and our ſinleſſe infirmities, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. doth now expect, (according to the tenour of the ſame paction) after he hath done his work, to be exalted, and openly declared to be the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is the property and prerogative of the true God, to be glorious and excellent, and conſequently, to be delighted in as ſuch, and reverenced; for, this is the evidence of his Godhead, that he hath <hi>glory</hi> proper to him. 2. The glory of God is not borrowed from the creatures, but is eſſential, immutable, and eternal before any creature was; for, it is a <hi>glory before the world was.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt is true God, and was infinitely glorious from all eternity; for, he who now appears in the forme of a ſervant, <hi>had glory before the world was.</hi> 4. As all ſolid glory is only in heaven with God, ſo Chriſts divine glory is with the Father, communicating with him in the divine eſſence and glory; Therefore is this glory expected <hi>with thy own ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>the glory which I had with thee;</hi> Whereby is not only to be underſtood, that he is to be glorified in heaven with the Father, and exalted theſe in his perſon as God-man, before he ſpread his glory as Mediator in the world: But that in his glory, as God, he communicates with the Father, being in and with the Father, and rejoycing alway before him, as the Son of his boſome, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. 5. It pleaſed the glorious Son of God, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Father, to humble himſelfe, and obſcure the glory of his Godhead; that he might be like his brethren, and a ſit Mediator for ſympathy and ſuffering; and, that he might engage his life and glory for redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Elect, and lay by his robes of Majeſty, not to be reaſſumed till he gave a good account of that work; for, here he humbles himſelfe, to have his glory to ſeek from the Father (in reſpect of his perſon God-man) upon the performance of what was entruſted to him, <hi>I have finiſhed the work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>And now glorifie me,</hi> ſaith he. 6.

And ſo they may in this part of the prayer, be looked on as repreſenting the whole Miniſtry and Church, and the purpoſe as much one in ſubſtance with the following part of the Chapter. Only Chriſt, for the full encouragement of his followers of all ſorts, would firſt pray ſomewhat for the Apoſtles expreſſely, leſt they ſhould think they were loſt among the bulk of profeſſour. And would have ſomewhat expreſſely for all beleevers in all ages, that they might not think they were forgotten by him, and only his diſciples cared for in this his ſolemne prayer to the Father.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt branch of this part of the Chapter, Chriſt deſcribes theſe whom he prayeth for, and giveth an account of his diligence about them, and ſucceſſe with them. Whereby, he not only giveth a notable inſtance of his fidelity which he had aſſerted, <hi>v.</hi> 4. but doth alſo recommend them to the Fathers care and love, and that the petitions put up for them may be anſwered. This deſcription and account is propounded in theſe verſes; which may be taken up in this order; That, for intereſt, theſe for whom he prayeth, were the Fathers by eternal election, and committed to his care and truſt, to purchaſe, apply and promove their happineſs. And for the matter of diligence and ſucceſſe; He had in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48148:180"/>
diſcharge of his truſt, taken them in teaching, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the Father unto them; which (being don in ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erviency to his eternal purpoſe of Election) had ſo ſucceeded, as they had kept the Fathers Word, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Chriſt to have received his authority, commiſſion, furniture and doctrine, from the Father. And ſo Chriſt gives a fair account of his bringing in of the Elect, in that he had converted the Apoſtles who were to be his inſtruments in converting of the reſt throughout the world; And layeth a ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to be heard in their behalfe, taken from Gods eternal intereſt in them, and their converted eſtate. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It doth commend the love of God toward fallen men, that fallen Angels being caſt off without hope of recovery, they are admitted to the hope of Redemption and reſtitution after their fall; for, this great truſt of Chriſt is diſcharged toward <hi>men.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. 2. Chriſts commiſſion extends not to all the world, but to ſome in it only; for, he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>the men which thou gaveſt me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of the world,</hi> even the Apoſtles, and other Elect. 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difference there be in Gods eternal purpoſe, or wrought by Chriſts grace, in theſe committed to him; Yet Gods love and Chriſts grace findes them in the ſame condition with others, till the difference be made: for, they are <hi>given out of the world.</hi> 4. All theſe of whom Chriſt takes ſpecial care, are the Fathers by a peculiar intereſt, as being appropriate for him in his eternal purpoſe of Election; for, <hi>thine they were,</hi> ſaith he, Not as all other things are: but elected by him to be his peculiar people. 5. The Elect, being the Fathers property, are not entruſted with that happineſſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to be conferred upon them; But are given over to Chriſt, and committed to him in the covenant of Redemption, that he may die to ſatisfie juſtice and obtain eternal Redemption for them, and may apply his purchaſe, in converting them, and preſerving them and their furniture, till they come to obtain everlaſting life: for, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> Not only to the Apoſtleſhip, of which, <hi>v.</hi> 12. but entruſted to him, with all the Elect, in that paction betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, of which <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.37, 39. So that they who are under his charge may be ſure, conſidering his infinite ſufficiency for it, and his fidelity to the Father who hath entruſted him. 6. The firſt viſible evidence of election, and of mens being committed to Chriſts truſt, breaks forth in the work of converſion; for, upon theſe two it followeth, <hi>and they have kept thy Word.</hi> This is not only Chriſts charge to ſee it done, but the Fathers alſo, who engageth to draw Chriſts purchaſe unto him, <hi>Joh</hi> 6.44. So that converſion is a fruit of Gods eternal love, land of Chriſts taking charge of us, both which we may look back and read, when we finde that change wrought. See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. 7. True and effectual converſion is wrought by the Word of God, as the inſtrument; So that any change wrought by another mean, will not avail, nor is there any hope of them who contemne the Word, let them have what other means they will; for, <hi>I have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Name, and they have kept thy word.</hi> See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. 8. It is not the naked propoſition of the Word that will avail to converſion, unleſſe the heart be opened, and the Word born in with ſuch effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as to reveal God in his nature, and attributes, of juſtice, mercy in his Chriſt, power, holineſſe, &amp;c. as the fragrant ſmell thereof may invite ſinners to draw near; for, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> ſaith he, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their converſion. 9. Who ever be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtring the Word; yet it is Chriſt that muſt reveal the Father in and by it, and make it effectual; for, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> ſaith he; Not only by his preaching in perſon, but by his powerful operation and illumination, which muſt be his work in all ages, though Miniſters be his inſtruments. 10. However repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates do live obſtinate under the Word, to their own perdition; And however the Elect may lye long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted; Yet the Word, being adminiſtred to them as a ſubſervient mean of executing the decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will in due time prevail in Chriſts hand, to their converſion: for, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me, who were thine, and they have kept thy Word.</hi> 11. Such as have found the Word effectual to their converſion, will be ſure to lay it up in their heart, as their daily food, and to obſerve it in their practice; and to do ſo, becauſe of the Authority of God ſhining in it; for, this is an evidence of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>they have kept thy Word,</hi> that ſo they may be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the ſame mean by which they are begotten. 12. It is alſo a ſpecial evidence of true converſion, to know Chriſt ſavingly and the myſtery of Redemption, to know Chriſts union with the Father, his commiſſion and authority from him as Mediator, and to ſee God in Chriſt; for, this is another evidence of his ſucceſſe, they looked not on Chriſt as the malicious Jews did, but <hi>now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me</hi> (the office of Mediator, and furniture for it) <hi>are of thee,</hi> and not uſurped by me, or of my ſelfe, nor any invention of man, but all divine and heavenly. Which commendation, with what follows, <hi>v</hi> 8. ſeems to be grounded on their profeſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.30. 13. Whatever may be the weakneſſe and ignorance of true converts, for a time; Yet being in Chriſts hand, and through his bleſſing on the means, they will at laſt come up to a more full meaſure: for, ſaith he, <hi>Now they have known, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, in reſpect of degrees of knowledge, and fixedneſs in it. 14. Jeſus Chriſt, the great Advocate of his people, doth cover their defects, eſteem of their ſmall beginnings, conſidering what he purpoſeth to make them; And however he point out their faults to themſelves, to humble them, yet he will preſent and commend their weak beginnings to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore, albeit he chide their preſumption in their profeſſing after his commending of them, <hi>ch.</hi> 16.27, 30, 31, 32. yet here, and in the following verſe he doth notably commend them to the Father. 15. Albeit it be our duty to embrace Chriſt offering himſelfe, and to be converted, and it is our great happineſſe when it is ſo; Yet it is put on Chriſt, that he ſhould not only give an account of his diligence, but of his ſucceſſe alſo, and that he not only offer ſalvation to the Elect, but preſent them alſo converted to his Father. As here, and in the following verſe he doth. 16. Such as have embraced Chriſts offer, have ſweet ground of confidence to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of the Father, and heard in prayer; Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both his eternal love and intereſt, and the grace of God in them, needing his preſervation and upholding; Therefore doth Chriſt preſent them as theſe who were the Fathers, and are now converted, that ſo he may be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48148:180"/>
accepted in his prayers for them; for, albeit he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and prevail for the converſion of the elect, as knowing who are given him; yet they can have no comfort of it, unleſſe they be converted.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe Chriſt inſiſts to enlarge and amplifie this his account of diligence and ſucceſſe about them; ſhewing that he delivered them no Word but what the Father had given him, and that they had received it, and certainly, beleeved the truth concerning his perſon and office, that he came out, and was ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the Father. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is not a ſleighter of his truſt, nor will he content himſelf ſuperficially to diſcharge it, but will ſo go about it, as he may abide the ſtricteſt inqueſt concerning his fidelity in it; Therefore doth he over again, by way of confirmation, inſiſt to give his account, <hi>for I have given, &amp;c.</hi> as not declining to be tried and better tried concerning it. 2. Converſion unto God is a buſineſs of ſo great importance, as men ought not eaſily to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves about it; Therefore alſo doth he again give an account of the way of their Converſion, that we may learn to try and try again if we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted indeed. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 3. In the trial of Converſion, it is not enough to ſee what change is wrought, but what the Word is that wrought it; that it be not a word of errour, but the ſound Word of truth coming from Chriſt; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them.</hi> 4. Whatever word be held out for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and converſion of ſinners; yet the divine original and authority thereof muſt be ſtudied and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, before it be effectual, or received and obeyed; for, in order to their Converſion, he ſaith, <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt unto me,</hi> even divine truth, which they acknowledged to be of God, <hi>v.</hi> 7. 5. The word of divine truth concerning the converſion and ſalvation of loſt man, is delivered by the Father to Chriſt, the great Prophet of his Church, that he may communicate the ſame to his people, and ſee to the preſervation thereof in the world; for, <hi>theſe words,</hi> are <hi>the words which thou,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>gaveſt me.</hi> So that the doctrine of the Goſpel proceeds from the Father, and Chriſt is entruſted with the preſervation thereof in this corrupt world. 6. Chriſt is faithful in his Prophetical office, and hath concealed no truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, but delivered all that was entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by the Father; for, <hi>I have given them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> 7. As the Elect do all of them, in due time, welcome and entertain God and Chriſts Word and all of it, whatever it ſay; ſo they who do receive the Word ſo as to open their hearts to it, as a word of truth, admitting the convictions, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and directions thereof, do give true evidence of their converſion thereby; for, this was an evidence thereof in the Apoſtles, <hi>they have received them,</hi> which includes that <hi>knowledge and beleeving</hi> after-mentioned And where the Word is not thus received and welcom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, there it will purſue and overtake ſinners, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.6. 8.

                  <p>In theſe verſes is contained the ſecond branch of this part of the chapter; wherein Chriſt appropriates his prayer to his Apoſtles, and his elect in them, in oppoſition to the world. For which he giveth ſeveral reaſons; As 1. That they are his charge given him by the Father. 2. That they are the Fathers alſo by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal election; unto which he ſubjoyns an illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, clearing how they are the Fathers, being given to him; namely, that both as God he hath a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father in all things, and as Mediatour alſo, as the Elect were given to him by the Father, and all things for their behoof, ſo they continued ſtill the Fathers in reſpect of election, and it was his work to make them the Fathers again, by converting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating them to him. 3. That he was glorified in them, and therefore would intercede for them. All which makes it clear that he doth not reſtrict this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the perſons of the Apoſtles only, but to all theſe who are not of the world, but have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Father and him; for whom alſo he prayeth expreſly, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Jeſus Chriſt is the great High Prieſt, not only to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, but by his prayer and interceſſion, to compleat his work, and apply his purchaſe; for, <hi>I pray,</hi> ſaith he, as giving in this action a pattern of his perpetual interceſſion in heaven. 2.

knowledge of all the neceſſities of his people, and of the true remedy and ſupply thereof; who hath fidelity and tenderneſſe not to ſleight thoſe whom he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; who is not refuſed of any ſuit he puts up for them, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.42. and whoſe merit and interceſſion is ſufficient to render naughty perſons and ſervices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>efore it is held out as a ſpecial priviledge <hi>I pray for them, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 3. Chriſt did not go about the exerciſe of his Mediatory-office at adventure, not knowing whether many or few, all or none, would reap benefit thereby; But he knew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly for whom he appeared, and for whom not: for, ſaith he, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world.</hi> 4. Chriſt was ſo far from laying down his life for all in the world, that all in and of the world are ſecluded from any part in his interceſſion, except only the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for, whatſoever ſome do ſay of Chriſts praying as a man under the Law, wherein he looks not ſo much to the event, as his duty, and ſo may pray for them in whoſe behalf he is not heard; to which they referre that prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. whatever, I ſay, they aſſert of this kinde, (wherein I ſhall not be poſitive, though that petition, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. for his ignorant perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, got a large anſwer in the Converſion of ſo many of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and afterwards) yet the world is here ſecluded from his interceſſion as Mediatour, and only the Elect taken in; <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world.</hi> Which yet doth no way militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our duty of praying for all manner of men who have not ſinned unto death; for his praying is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the diſtinct knowledge of the Will of God, and whom he will ſave, and therefore he prayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. Whereas we, wanting this knowledge, ought to pray for all men, with ſubmiſſion to the Will of God. 5. Whatever the elect be in themſelves, even a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter they are converted; yet the charge and truſt of them being committed to Chriſt, it doth engage him to intercede for them: ſo that all his wounds bleed, and his credit in heaven is employed, when they have to do; for, <hi>I pray for them which thou haſt given me,</hi> ſaith he, 6. The Elect are ſo given to Chriſt, as they are ſtill the Fathers, in reſpect of his eternal election and good will toward them; for, <hi>them which thou haſt given me, they are thine.</hi> 7. It is a notable encouragement to employ God on behalfe of the Elect, that he hath ſuch an intereſt in them, and being choſen by him, they are caſt upon him, and left upon his help; for, upon this conſideration doth he commend his given ones to the Father in prayer: <hi>for they are thine,</hi> and that he commends none to him, but thoſe whom he firſt gave him. 8. Chriſts people have room in his heart and affection, not only becauſe of his intereſt in them, and charge of them: but becauſe of the intereſt the Father hath alſo in them, whoſe beloved Son he is; for, this is not only a reaſon why the Father ſhould reſpect his prayers for them, but alſo why he ſo hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertakes to pray for them: <hi>for, they are thine.</hi> Which ſhould teach all, in their ſtations, heartily to reſpect and care for thoſe perſons or things wherein God hath an intereſt. 9. There is a communion and reciprocal intereſt in all things betwixt the Father and his Son, who is heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and Chriſt as Mediatour, in the Elect; for, <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> 10. This communion and intereſt tends much to the advantage of Gods people, as having intereſt both in the Father and the Son; ſo that Chriſt will not neglect thoſe who are not only his own peculiar property entruſted to him, but his Fathers alſo, and will have a care to make them forth-coming to the Father: And the Father will reſpect thoſe, and his Son in interceding for them, who are not only his beloved Sons charge, but his own alſo. Therefore are both the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments conjoyned in this; <hi>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> to aſſure us how careful Chriſt will be of them, and how acceptable theſe endeavours will be to the Father. 11. Chriſt who is the Lord of glory, and needs nothing from the creature, doth yet ſtoop to take glory from his people, in ſo far as he glorifieth himſelf in them; for, <hi>I am glorified in them.</hi> 12. How unworthy ſoever Chriſts people be, yet it is a ſufficient argument moving him to do for them, and to prevail in what he doth, that he doth manifeſt his own glory in ſo doing, and by the fruits thereof in them; for, this is another argument why he intercedes for them, <hi>And I am glorified in them,</hi> namely, by doing good to them, and by their behaviour being ſo dealt with; And particularly, as they were Apoſtles, by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world, his triumphs were proclaimed, and the world ſubjected to his obedience. And this may aſſure us, that the more our endeavour and aime be to glorifie God and Chriſt, we have the clearer ground to expect the acceptation of our prayers.</p>

In this verſe the petition is propounded, that the Father would preſerve theſe whom he had given him, in an ill world, that they may be kept in unity. The petition is uſhered in with a propoſition of their caſe, that they are to be left in the world, deprived of their Maſters company who had a care of them, and therefore he muſt leave them upon divine protection, not ſecluding his own ſpiritual, but only bodily preſence. Which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is more fully expreſſed in the following verſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1, Chriſt after his Aſcenſion is no more in the world in reſpect of his bodily preſence, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill in it as God, and by his governing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Spirit; for, ſaith he, being now ſhortly to die, and aſcend to heaven; <hi>Now I am no more in the world.</hi> 2. Chriſt when he removed out of the world, did aſcend to his Father, and enjoy full fellowſhip with him, as having done his work on earth, and being to appear conſtantly in heaven, in name of his children; for, ſaith he, <hi>I come to thee.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſts people be all dear to him, yet he doth leave them behind him on earth for a time, that they may glorifie him by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their generation; may have occaſion to draw out
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48148:181"/>
many proofes of his love, and be trained and fitted for their eternal inheritance; for, <hi>Now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world.</hi> 4. Albeit Chriſts followers will get tender uſage while they are weak and infirme, yet they muſt not expect alwayes to lurk, and be dandled, but muſt come out and meet with blaſts, wherein they may give proofs of their proficiency by ſuch tender uſage; for the diſciples who were ſheltered ſo long under their Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, are now left alone deprived of his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; <hi>I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world,</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 9, 14, 15. 5. The world is ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren a ſoile to grace, Saints corruptions lay them ſo open to the tentations thereof, and theſe of the world are ſo bad company to theſe who are gracious, that they would be very miſerable unleſſe they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſide the world, and the conſolations thereof, to ſweeten their lots unto them, and uphold them; Therefore doth he recommend them to the Fathers care and pity upon this conſideration; <hi>Theſe are in the world.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. 6. None of Chriſts given-ones are obnoxious to miſeries and hazards, but only theſe who are yet in the world, all the reſt who are gone hence, being in a condition of compleat and immutable happineſſe; Therefore he is only ſolicitous and prayeth for <hi>theſe</hi> that <hi>are in the world.</hi> 7. Chriſt, by removing his bodily preſence, took not away his heart from his people on earth, nor did caſt off his care of them; for, in his farewel he diſcovers much ſenſe of their need; <hi>Theſe are in the world.</hi> 8. As Chriſts removal did not, ſo neither doth his exaltation into glory change his heart from reſpecting his people; but he looks on his exaltation, as calling for ſome fruits to deſcend to his followers on earth from him their exalted Lord; and his tender heart will never be free of cares and deſires about them, ſo long as he and they are not in one condition, but he exalted at the Fathers right hand, and they left wraſtling on earth; for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conſiderations doth he recommend their caſe; <hi>Theſe are in the world, and I come to thee.</hi> 9. Chriſts tender heart, and care of his people in his abſence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, in that he is very ſenſible of their difficulties on earth, <hi>(Theſe are in the world;)</hi> in that his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in the world, to honour him, and do him ſervice, doth endear them to him, and engage him to ſee to all that may befall them, (as here he doth take notice of them before the Father, ſince he left them in the world;) and, in that in his bodily abſence, he is careful to ſupply all wants by his interceſſion; as here his practice doth teach. 10. Saints on earth, (though truly gracious, yet) do need conſtant preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as having many trials and tentations of Satan, and much lazineſſe and inward luſts, to deprive them of their good condition and ruine them; for, this is a neceſſary ſuit, <hi>keep them.</hi> 11. As Saints ought to be content with preſervation, ſo they will get it, (for, what he prayeth for is granted,) and when Chriſt withdraws one mean of preſervation, he will ſtill afford another; And what his followers want of outward or ſenſible encouragement, ſhall be ſupplied in a ſpiritual way; All theſe are imported in this, that when Chriſt who had kept them, (as it is <hi>v.</hi> 12.) is to be removed, he findes out a way of their preſervation, <hi>I am no more in the world, Father keep them.</hi> 12. The want of Chriſts bodily preſence on earth, to overſee and preſerve his flock, is richly ſupplied by his interceſſion as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and the divine protection of the Father to whom they are committed; for, <hi>I am no more in the world,</hi> and to ſupply that, he prayeth, <hi>Father, keep them,</hi> making up that loſſe by his interceſſion, and the Fathers power. 13. It is the duty of all ſuch as have ſouls committed to their charge, to put them on Gods hand, and to be earneſt with him for his care over them; as Chriſts example doth teach, <hi>Father keep thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi> 14. As the elect are committed to Chriſts charge, to give an account of them; ſo alſo is the Father engaged for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (<hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.) and for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, being converted, as being not only his own, given to Chriſt out of his love to them, but as being engaged to Chriſt, that he ſhall not be fruſtrate of the reward of his ſufferings, but have a ſeed to glorifie him eternally: Therefore doth Chriſt not only conſtantly preſerve them by his Spirit, but doth leave that burden alſo on the Father, <hi>Father keep thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. 15. It gives great ground of confidence in Chriſts interceſſion for his people, that he prayeth to his Father, and their Father in him; And believers, in their addreſſes to God through Chriſt, ought to take him up as Chriſts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and theirs in him; for, by this warme title, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Chriſt would not only intimate his own familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but would give us a faire ground of hope that he ſhall be heard for us, and direct us how to pray for our ſelves. 16. Confidence of intereſt in God, ſhould be ſeaſoned with much reverence in prayer, and we ſhould cloſe with ſuch attributes in God as are ſuitable to our conditions and petitions, and may help our confidence; for both theſe cauſes doth Chriſt adde that Epithet, <hi>Holy Father,</hi> to teach us, that as he is a <hi>Father,</hi> ſo he is <hi>Holy</hi> and reverend, and that none who draw near to him ſhould entertain motions or deſires contrary to his holineſſe; and to aſſure us, that a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for preſervation from the evil of the world, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be acceptable to an <hi>holy</hi> God; and, that he who is the <hi>holy God,</hi> is able to preſerve and continue them holy, and will not make void his promiſe to his Son concerning his given-ones Thus is his holineſſe engaged in every promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.6. and 89.35, 17. God, who hath undertaken the preſervation of his people, doth hold out in himſelf ſufficient ground of confidence, that he is both able and willing to do it, and can finde reaſons in himſelf for it; for, ſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this, <hi>keep them in,</hi> or, <hi>through thine owne Name;</hi> which imports, both that Gods <hi>Name,</hi> or what he hath revealed of himſelf, is a ſtrong tower to which they may flee, there being ſufficiencie of power, wiſdom, mercie, immutability, &amp;c. in him, to keep them ſafe on all hands; as alſo, that he will preſerve them, becauſe his Name is called upon them, and for his Names ſake, and becauſe his glory is engaged, and will ſhine in ſo doing, whatever they be in themſelves; and becauſe he can reveal his Name, and make his Name known unto them, that they may cleave to him, and be preſerved. 18. Only theſe who are given to Chriſt, have aſſurance of divine protection and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and all of theſe have warrant to expect it, even the ſmalleſt and weakeſt; as well as the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle;

                  <p>This petition Chriſt preſſeth by three Arguments; The firſt whereof (in this verſe) is taken from his care of theſe given him while he was bodily preſent with them. He had ſuch a care of them, as he can make a fair account that none of them are loſt; Only <hi>Judas</hi> was gone, who though he were choſen to the Apoſtleſhip, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.70. yet was never given to be redeemed or ſaved by him, but was one deſtinate to perdition, of whoſe defection and ruine the Scriptures, ſpeaking of him under the type of <hi>Achithophel</hi> and other of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, (<hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.25. and 109.8.) had foretold. From which Chriſt would inferre, that he being (not to quit his charge which he exerceth with the Father ſtill, but) to remove from them in reſpect of his bodily preſence, as <hi>v.</hi> 11. and 14. therefore the Father muſt keep them, that his pains be not loſt. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt the Son of God did for a time condeſcend to be preſent with his people in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, as for other ends, ſo, to teſtifie his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reſpect to their infirmity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.15, 16. and to give a proofe that he will ſtill be tender of his people; for, <hi>I was with them in the world.</hi> 2. There is no time wherein diſciples, while they are in the world, will not need care and over ſight without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for their preſervation; for, as now they were to need, ſo then they did need to be <hi>kept.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſt, while he was in the world, had his own throng of ſharp exerciſe and ſufferings; Yet all that did not hinder him to lay out himſelfe in caring for his people, and to make his bodily preſence comfortable to them; for, <hi>while I was with them in the world, I kept them.</hi> 4. Chriſt did exerciſe this charge of keeping his people in the Fathers <hi>Name,</hi> that is, not only out of love to the Father whoſe name is called upon them, (as true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e for them, becauſe of their relation to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21 15.) but alſo by the power of God, and his attributes, communicate to him from the Father as God, and concurring with him in carrying on his work as Mediatour. Whereby as he leaves us a pattern of ſelfe-denial in the enjoyment of all our gifted excellencies; So he teacheth all beleevers to aſcribe the glory of their perſeverance to God only; for theſe cauſes, and in theſe reſpects, he ſaith, <hi>I kept them in thy Name.</hi> 5. Chriſt is ſo faithful in caring for theſe committed to him, that he can make a fair account of one and all of them, and of his dealing and diſpenſations toward them, that none of them are a miſſing, but all well and ſafely kept and guided; for, <hi>Theſe that thou gaveſt me, I kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> And this is ſome ſhaddow of the great account he will make of all his flock in the laſt day. 6. When Chriſt hath taken pains upon his people, as they will ſtill need more, ſo he takes an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from what he hath done, to do more for them, becauſe he will not loſe the pains he hath taken; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt plead, that ſince he had taken ſo much pains and kept them, therefore the Father would keep them ſtill, as he hath deſired. 7. As there are in the world given ones, of whom Chriſt will have a care, ſo there are ſons of perdition and men appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for their ſin; for, ſo ſaith Chriſt there is <hi>but the ſon of perdition.</hi> Which cannot come in here by way of exception, as if the meaning were, I have loſt none of them whom thou haſt given me, except <hi>Judas:</hi> for it is clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, 39, 40. that none of all theſe the Father gave him ſhall periſh. And <hi>Judas</hi> was never given to Chriſt to be redeemed, but only to the office of Apoſtleſhip. But it comes in by way of oppoſition, (as the Original particle is frequently uſed) to this ſenſe, I have loſt none of them thou haſt given me; but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> is loſt, or, though <hi>Judas</hi> be loſt. And the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion uſed for deſignation of <hi>Judas</hi> doth ſerve to obviate an exception; for, whereas it might be objected, how had he loſt none, ſince <hi>Judas</hi> was gone; He anſwers that he was therefore loſt becauſe he was never ſo given to him, but from the beginning was a ſon of perdition, or, a man appointed to deſtruction, as the Hebrew phraſe imports 8. Sons of perdition may be not only in the world, and in the viſible Church, but even very high in Chriſts Court as to external employment and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48148:182"/>
ſervice; for, ſo was <hi>Judas</hi> given to be an Apoſtle, whoſe defection neceſſitates Chriſt to vindicate himſelfe that he was not the leſſe faithful in his truſt, though ſuch an eminent man did periſh. 9. Sons of perdition are ſuch as will not be the better of any means, or care, but will periſh were they even in Chriſts own company, and his hands (as to outward diſpenſations) about them; for, ſo <hi>Judas</hi> in Chriſts own Court, is <hi>the Son of perdition,</hi> and will and doth periſh. 10. The defection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Reprobates, were they never ſo eminent, doth not any way rub on Chriſts fidelity in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they never being given to him, to ſave them; for, he gives a faithful account to his Father, though <hi>the ſon of perdition</hi> be loſt. 11. God is not deceived by the defection and periſhing of any, how eminent ſoever, but as he had his eternal purpoſe about them, ſo he could give an account what would become of them, if it were needfull, long before they had a being; As he gives proofe in his foretelling of <hi>Judas</hi> and his defection and ruine, ſo long before, in <hi>the Scripture.</hi> 12. The Scriptures of God are of infallible verity, in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, promiſes, or predictions; for, <hi>the Scripture muſt be fulfilled.</hi> 13. The beſt way to read ſtrange and croſſe diſpenſations, is, to ſee an hand and providence of God in them, which may quiet our hearts, till we get a more full and diſtinct account of his minde in them; Therefore, in mentioning <hi>the ſon of perdiction.</hi> he leads us to <hi>the Scripture,</hi> wherein God by foretelling thereof, teſtified his providence about it, and to the <hi>fulfilling</hi> thereof by his defection, that we may ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, but that wherein he had an holy hand.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The ſecond argument, preſſing the petition, is taken from Chriſts end in putting up the petition in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples audience, and the event that ſhould follow upon the Fathers granting the ſame; Namely, the fulfilling and compleating of their joy, who were much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the removal of his bodily preſence. The ſumme of the argument is, That he being to remove and take away his bodily preſence, which had been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to his diſciples; albeit his interceſſion in heaven might have ſufficed for obtaining what they needed; Yet he would recommend them to the Father, and pray for preſervation to them, in their own audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſo they might be encouraged, ſeeing his care of them, and having hope of audience to ſuch a ſute put up by ſuch a petitioner. And therefore he would inferre that the Father will not diſappoint their hope, but fulfil their joy by granting the requeſt. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſts removal out of the world looked very ſweet upon him, as being a coming to his Father with whom he is ſo familiar; And in him death is ſanctified and ſweetned to all his followers, as being a departing to him, that they may be with him for ever, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. So doth he deſcribe his removal, <hi>Now I come to thee.</hi> 2. Chriſt is very condeſcending in his dealing with and for his people, and doth not only what is ſimply needful, but what in reaſon may abundantly ſatisfie them, notwithſtanding their tentations and infirmities, for, albeit his interceſſion being exalted at the right hand of the Father was ſufficient to bring about needful benefits; yet for their ſatisfaction, he will even pray in their audience, <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak in the world.</hi> And this ſhould gain our conſent to ſay, he doth all things well, and by what we ſee of his condeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any particular, to truſt him in others more dark. 3. Joy is allowed by Chriſt upon all his followers: It is his ſcope in his dealing toward them, and he hath done and daily doth what may breed them joy; for, this is his ſcope here, that they may have joy. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. 4. The faith and knowledge of Chriſts interceſſion for his people, that they may be preſerved and made to perſevere, is ſuch a pledge of their ſure eſtate and of his good-will toward them, as may afford abundant matter of joy in their ſaddeſt caſe; for, <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they may have joy.</hi> 5. The joy of beleevers is of Chriſts allowing, is his work in them, and a joy in him over all that they finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Therefore doth he call it <hi>my joy.</hi> 6. Chriſts joy, allowed on his people, is a compleat joy, far beyond the empty joy of the world, in midſt whereof the heart is ſorrowful; And albeit the full degrees of their joy will meet them in heaven, yet their joy here is full in parts, as ſatisfying the minde, calming their ſtormes, and ſtaying their foot againſt all eſſayes, if they emprove it right. Therefore is this joy in that he prayes for them, and their joy in obtaining their anſwer, called a <hi>fulfilled joy.</hi> 7. Chriſt doth not only take care to give his people cauſe of joy, but to make them rejoyce in it alſo, and that with an inexpreſſible joy, whereof others are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; Therefore will he have it fulfilled <hi>in themſelves,</hi> that is, their hearts filled with it, and feeding on that hid Manna, whereof ſtrangers are not pertakers, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. 8. The Father doth allow that which Chriſt doth for the encouragement of his people, and will not let it be ineffectual: For this is Chriſts argument for obtaining his ſure, which certainly hath weight with the Father, <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>The third argument preſſing the petition, is taken from the worlds oppoſition to them being converted. The word which Chriſt gave them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. had ſo far wrought upon them, as to regenerate them, and make them diſſent from the world in judgement, affection and converſation, ſo rendering them conforme, in ſome meaſure, to him their Head. And this change made them incurre the worlds hatred, which doth call for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſervation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As it is Chriſts great favour and kindeneſſe to give his Word unto his people: ſo where it is given with a bleſſing, and rightly received, it draws the receiver to a diſconformity with the world, and not to be of it, though he be in it: for, <hi>I have given them thy Word,</hi> and <hi>they are not of the world.</hi> 2. It doth exceedingly commend the grace of God in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48148:183"/>
Saints, that albeit they kept in the world, and forced to walk among the many ſnares thereof, yet they are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it and not conforme unto it; for, though they are <hi>in the warld,</hi> v. 11. <hi>yet they are not of the world.</hi> 3.

It may encourage them alſo in this conflict, that in their ſtate &amp; ſuffering, they have a conformity with Chriſt their Head, conformity with whom is a great dignity; for, by this alſo doth he encourage them, <hi>they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> He or his Kingdome are not of this world more then they are, and their ſuffering on this account redounds to him, who is firſt hated, and for whoſe ſake and becauſe of conformity with him, they are hated. 6.

Such as are employed to ſpeak in publike for the edification of others, ought to make it their ſtudy to accommodate their ſpeech to the capacity of their hearers; As Chriſt here doth ſo ſpeak as may clearly explain his meaning unto them. 3. Chriſt hath more wayes then one whereby to ſecure his people againſt all they can meet with; As here he hath one way of preſervation, which he layeth by for a time, and another, which he pitcheth upon. 4. There is one fair outgate from all troubles abiding Saints, when by death they ſhall be tranſlated out of the world, and above the reach of all their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; for, this is one outgate, though he will not make uſe of it, at this time, to <hi>take them out of the world.</hi> See <hi>Job.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. 5. Albeit death be very often deſired by Saints in their perplexities; Yet Chriſt ſeeth it meet rather to exerciſe them for a time, and fit them for proofes of his love, then to grant that deſire: And however we ought ſtill to have our eye upon our reſt, and make ready for it; Yet we are not anxiouſly to long after it, till his time come, nor to weary of life, eſpecially becauſe of any trouble, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or inconvenience we meet with in his ſervice; Therefore Chriſt, who loves his people better then they do love themſelves, will not pray for this, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit Chriſt will not remove his people from theſe hazards, yet they are no way able to guard themſelves againſt them, but they muſt reſolve to have much to do, and very little, or rather nothing, in themſelves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to do it; for, they muſt be <hi>keeped,</hi> or elſe they are undone. 8. When Chriſt ſeeth it not fit to remove his own out of the world, he will ſee to their preſervation in it; So as though they get now and then the foile, yet his interceſſion is a ſure pledge that they ſhall recover again; for, theſe two go together, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them.</hi> 9. Chriſt doth abundantly teſtifie his care and diligence about his people, when albeit he doth not exempt them from troubles, and theſe it may be very ſharp, yet he keeps them from the evil thereof, or from ſpiritual hurt thereby; And when, albeit he doth not deliver them even from aſſaults, and tentations from that evil, yet he upholds them by ſufficient grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9, 10. for, herein doth his care appear, in praying that the Father ſhould <hi>keep them from the evil,</hi> 10. Albeit many, when they look upon Chriſts promiſes and allowances, and his interceſſion for his people, be ready to delude themſelves with vain hopes of that which Chriſt never allowed upon them; Yet they who are content with being preſerved from evil, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be tempted and exerciſed, are no way deluded when they expect this from Chriſt; for, it is his expreſs will, when he explains himſelfe, that they ſhould be <hi>keeped from the evil.</hi> 11. It is frequently to be ſtudied by beleevers, that their ſeparation from the world, is an evidence of their conformity with Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they are like to him, in enduring oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the world, becauſe thereof; Therefore is it again held out, <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> 12. Beleevers diſconformity with the

Unto this is ſubjoyned the inſtrumental cauſe of their ſanctification, <hi>through thy truth,</hi> whereby is not only ſignified, that he would have them ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in truth,</hi> or, <hi>truly,</hi> of which we may hear, <hi>v.</hi> 19. but that the Word of truth is the mean and inſtrument of ſanctification: And to prevent all miſtakes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that this truth is in the Word, againſt all them who ſeek truth beſide it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as are Chriſts followers indeed, and may make comfortable application of other benefits of his interceſſion, muſt be men ſanctified, by habitual graces of holineſſe infuſed into them, which will not only break forth in ſome few acts of Religion and righteouſneſſe, but muſt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote and conſecrate them to God, as they may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves to another uſe: for, ſo much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this that Chriſt prayes for, unto his Apoſtles, <hi>Sanctifie them,</hi> intimating, that where he intercedes for any, he alſo prayeth for, and, in due time, works this in them. 2, It is not enough that men have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun work of ſanctification in them, unleſſe they grow up in it daily more and more: for, he prayeth for theſe who were already converted and ſanctified, as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his account, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. that the Father would <hi>ſanctifie them,</hi> and carry them on in ſanctification till it be perfected in glory. Such will be invited to grow, who entertain the ſenſe of what they have received, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. who are ſenſible of their ſhort-coming in what they have, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13. and who fear back-ſliding, and conſider that not to grow, is the way to decay: and they will ſtudy to evidence this growth, by perſevering in their firſt principles, not loving age in what once through grace they loathed, nor building up what they once deſtroyed; and by growing in graces, eſpecially in ſenſe of their pollution, humility, love, painfulneſſe, &amp;c. 3. Whatever principles or obligations men have to keep them from the evils of the world, and from Satan in it: yet all theſe will not avail, unleſſe they be not only truly ſanctified, but be growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Therefore is this petition, <hi>ſanctifie them,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the former, <hi>v.</hi> 15. of <hi>keeping</hi> them, as being the effectual mean of their preſervation. 4. As ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the duty of beleevers, laid upon them by God; ſo it is alſo his work in them, who principleth them for it, and works it in them, when they, in the ſenſe of their own inability, do put it upon him: for, Chriſt by prayer ſeeketh it of the Father, <hi>ſanctifie them.</hi> 5. As the truth of God is the rule of true ſanctification, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being holineſſe in Gods account, how ſpecious ſoever it be, unleſſe it be according to that truth; So the truth of God which is the inſtrument of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath alſo a ſpecial influence in the matter of daily ſanctification, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. The word of command being made effectual to preſſe the duty, the word of promiſe to encourage it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and the Word and doctrine of the Croſſe of Chriſt holding out vertue enabling to duty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing faith which purifieth the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. In both theſe reſpects he prayeth, <hi>Sanctifie them through,</hi> or, <hi>in thy truth,</hi> both as the rule and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of ſanctification, and as a mean and inſtrument of it. 6. It is not ſafe for men to cry up their own or others ſanctification, to the countenancing of the errours which they maintain; but they muſt prove the truth of their holineſſe, by the truth which hath been inſtrumental in it, and muſt reckon that the holineſs they have, is either counterfeit, or elſe hath been wrought, not by their errours, but by the power of ſome real truthes which they have, or do ſtill hold, and that therefore by embracing errour they do exceedingly wrong their piety, by depriving themſelves of the mean which doth beget and cheriſh it; for theſe cauſes doth Chriſt ſo expreſly pray, not only, <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them,</hi> by what mean ſoever, but <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth,</hi> as the only mean of true holineſſe. 7. Whatever efficacie truth hath in the matter of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: it doth all come from God, who muſt be employed by prayer to make the word ſucceſſeful for that end; for, ſo much doth Chriſt, example teach, who prayeth to the Father, <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth.</hi> See 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.1. 8. Whatever wayes men do dream of, for finding the truth of God, yet it is only to be found in the Word of God, and all other wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide will but produce deluſion and lies; Therefore doth he ſubjoine, to prevent all miſtakes, <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi> 9. Whatever may be the heſitations of men, concerning the Word of God, yet it is his infallible verity, and will not deceive them who betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it for direction and encouragement; for, <hi>Thy Word is truth,</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Argument preſſing this petition, is taken from their emploiment and calling to be his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in the world, which preſſeth the neceſſity of their ſanctification.

Chriſt is the great Apoſtle of our Profeſſion, ſent to us by the Father; ſo that we need not think ſhame of a Profeſſion which is owned by ſuch a one as he is; for, <hi>Thou haſt ſent me into the world.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. 2. Chriſt hath employed the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in their own room, to be his Embaſſadours, and to ſupply his place as he was a Preacher of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that as they ought to ſtudy an imitation of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 1. ſo they ought to be received in their Miniſtry, as coming in Chriſts ſtead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Gal</hi> 4.14. Therefore, ſaith he. <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, ſo have I alſo ſent them,</hi> as is before explained. 3. It doth commend the love of God, that he hath employed the Miniſtry of his Son and ſervants even in this corrupt world, that out of ſuch baſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials he may build up an excellent Church and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf; and that he may encourage the moſt deſperate to come to him, who out of ſuch gathereth his precious jewels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2, 3.4. Therefore it is ſaid that both he and they are ſent <hi>into the world.</hi> 4. Beſide the obligations and neceſſitie which lie upon Miniſters, with all Saints, to be holy, <hi>Heb</hi> 12.14. their calling doth particularly call for ſanctification and ſeparation from the world, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by divine precept, and for the well-being of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that ſo they may ſtand in their Maſters counſel, and be kept near him, that their face may ſhine, and they may be more ſucceſſeful in their Miniſtry; for, this is a condition calling for the granting that ſuit that they ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be ſanctified, even that they are <hi>ſent into the world.</hi> It is true, men may be lawful Miniſters, yea, and ſucceſſeful alſo in their Miniſtry, who are not ſanctified themſelves; for, even <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtle. And Chriſt is here more expreſly praying for his eleven Apoſtles, who beſide that they were Apoſtles, were given to him alſo by the Father, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the world, and the ſon of perdition, who yet was an Apoſtle, <hi>v</hi> 9, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. yet his reaſoning in prayer doth lay before all Miniſters, how needful it is they be ſanctified, not only in order to their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but even that their labour may be more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful, and this his reaſoning doth plead for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to all Miniſters, (who employ him for that end) in their own meaſure; however the extraordinary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment of the Apoſtles did plead for an extraordinary meaſure of this ſanctification, that they might be kept from errour, being <hi>ſanctified through the truth,</hi> and made fruitful in their great work. 5. When God doth call his ſervants to any employment, his calling may aſſure them of furniture, and what they need for diſcharge of that calling: And particularly, Chriſt will have a ſpecial care to furniſh Church-officers ſent out by himſelf; for, this is the face of Chriſts plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, which prevails with the Father, that ſince they are ſent into the world, therefore they may get ſanctification, <hi>Sanctifie them,</hi> v. 17. for, <hi>I have ſent them into the world.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22.</p>

                  <p>As the former reaſon, preſſing this petition, is taken from their need of ſanctification in reſpect of their calling: ſo this ſecond is taken from the cauſe and purchaſe of their ſanctification, by his ſanctifying himſelf, that they may be ſanctified; For clearing wherefore, Conſider, 1. Chriſts <hi>ſanctifying</hi> of <hi>himſelf,</hi> is not to be underſtood of any perſonal cleanſing now in doing, or to be done by him, for he was without ſpot from his firſt conception, nor yet of that purity of his nature only, but with relation to ſome further ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; But as in the language of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, things are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> when they are ſet apart, fitted and prepared for ſome ſpecial ſervice and employment, and particularly, Prieſts are ſaid to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to their office, and ſacrifices to be offered up: ſo Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt, in going about the office of Mediatour, and offering up himſelf a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, did wholly conſecrate and ſet himſelf apart for his peoples behoof, that he might be theirs, and ſeek their well and not his own; for, <hi>for their ſakes he ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> or, conſecrated, and ſet apart <hi>himſelf,</hi> to that work; which may engage them not to be their own, but wholly his. 2. As the Father did conſecrate and ſanctifie his Son to the office of Mediatour, <hi>John</hi> 10.36. ſo he alſo did conſecrate himſelf, as having inherent worth, and not needing external conſecrations, and as being a moſt willing Agent in this work; for, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Albeit the elect be in themſelves polluted, and have no worth to merit any
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48148:184"/>
purification from God; yet there is enough in Chriſt and his conſecrating himſelf a ſacrifice to the Father, to ſupply all their worthleſneſſe; and obtain what they need; for, <hi>for their ſake I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they may be ſanctified.</hi> 4. True ſanctification of the elect ſlows from Chriſts ſanctifying and conſecrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Father for them; not only doth the merit of his ſuffering, being imputed, make them appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot and wrinkle in him, but the vertue of his death and ſacrifice muſt be applied, to ſanctifie them inherently; for, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they may be ſanctified.</hi> 5. Chriſt did ſanctifie and conſecrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſacrifice in the Father, not for theſe who die in their pollution, but for theſe only whom he in time ſanctifies thereby; for, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they may be ſanctified,</hi> the one followeth upon the other, not in the Apoſtles only, but all the Elect. 6. Chriſt doth approve of no ſanctification, but that which is truly ſuch, and abhorres all counterfeits of it, and ſuch as reſt on outſide ſanctification, or ſhadows of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe only; for, that is his aime, <hi>that they may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in truth.</hi> 7. Whatever effects good inclinations and education, moral principles or example, or Church-diſcipline and Ordinances, or afflictions on men, may produce; yet true ſanctification ſlows only from the application of Chriſts ſacrifice, and it is that which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Followeth the third part of the Chapter, wherein Chriſt prayeth for the Apoſtles and whole Church of beleevers expreſly, ſeeking ſeveral benefits unto them. In theſe verſes, 1. He deſcribes theſe for whom he prayes; namely, not the Apoſtles only, but all theſe who to the end of the world ſhould by the Word preached by them, either immediately or mediately in the mouth of other meſſengers, be converted and drawn to beleeve on him, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 2. He propounds his firſt ſuit for them, the ſame in ſubſtance with what he had ſought unto the diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Namely, that they may be preſerved in unity, and be one in the Father and him, as he and the Father are one, and the Father in him, and he in the Father. This ſuit he amplifieth and preſſeth from the final cauſe thereof: namely, that by their union the world may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and made to beleeve the truth of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that Chriſt is an Embaſſadour, ſent by the Father into the world, <hi>v.</hi> 21. This unity prayed for, doth indeed include and preſuppoſe their unity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt and God in him, in which they are ſtated by beleeving, and which is the root of the other unity; But that which it moſt expreſly holds out, is unity in love flowing from the other, and which is viſible to the conviction of the world.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this world, left but a few followers, and his weak diſciples being entruſted with the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, were to meet with perſecution and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; yet he knew certainly his Kingdome was to ſpread, as accordingly he hath accompliſhed in the world; for, here he ſuppoſeth for certain, that there will be <hi>them who ſhall beleeve.</hi> 2. Chriſts love and heart are enlarged, to take in all his people throughout the world, and to employ himſelf in his Mediatory office and interceſſion for them; Therefore, after his prayer for himſelf, and for his Apoſtles, he doth now ſhew how large his affection is, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve.</hi> 3. Chriſts love towards his people is a preventing love, even before they have a being, and before they come to him; and whoever do in any age embrace him, ſhall finde that they were in his heart, and were as tenderly regarded and minded of him, in his ſuffering and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn interceſſion on earth, as any of his followers then preſent with him; for, here before they are, or do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they are remembred, and he hath left a blank that all beleevers in all ages may put in their owne name, as prayed for by him, when he prayeth for his Apoſtles, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve.</hi> 4. The character whereby Chriſts followers, and thoſe whom he prayes for, are diſcerned, is, their faith in him, whereby they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of themſelves to embrace and relie upon him, and to have all their ſubſiſtence by him; for, <hi>I pray for them which ſhall beleeve on me.</hi> Where albeit he pray for them before they beleeve, and that the meanes may be kept to them, till they be brought to beleeve; yet the thing here prayed for ſuppoſeth them in a ſtate of beleeving, and him interceding for what is needful to them in that ſtate. And albeit his interceſſion have influence alſo upon their beleeving, and is a mean to draw them to it; yet Chriſt doth not mention that in the Apoſtles audience, becauſe none can make comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able application of Chriſts interceſſion to themſelves, till firſt they be drawn to beleeve. 5. True faith is begotten by, and grounds it ſelf upon the Word of God delivered by the Apoſtles, without doating on ſignes and wonders, or expecting any other revelation of the minde of God; for, <hi>they beleeve on me through their word.</hi> Which alſo imports, that that Word will be continued, and a Miniſtry to preach it, ſo long as there is a Church, or any to be converted. 6. Such as are taught to diſcerne the divine authority of the Word, will not ſtumble at the deſpicableneſſe or meanneſſe of inſtruments carrying the ſame, but will cloſe with it by ſaith to ſalvation; for, albeit it be <hi>their word,</hi> as the inſtruments, who were but mean and deſpiſed men in the world, yet they <hi>beleeve on me through their word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The whole bulk of beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Catholike Church, though of different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conditions, are but one body in Chriſt their Head, having one Spirit, one faith, one baptiſme, &amp;c. <hi>Eph,</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. for, this is Chriſts aime, wherein
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48148:185"/>
he ſucceeds, that they which ſhall beleeve, <hi>may be one.</hi> 2. Whatever adverſity there be among beleevers, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, gifts and operations; yet this doth not, nor ought hinder their being one in him; and all of them have alike intereſt in him and his love; for, when he mentions the Apoſtles, who were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily gifted, and all beleevers of all ſorts, he prayeth <hi>that they all may be one.</hi> 3. As it is the great dignity and priviledge of beleevers to be one; ſo their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of this priviledge and living in unity, is the ſumme and compend of their happineſſe, and the mean of obtaining all other bleſſings; Therefore doth Chriſt ſo o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ten pray for this, and for this only in place of all, <hi>that they may be one.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jam</hi> 3.16. 4. Whatever be the bonds of unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beleevers, or their obligations to it, yet the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereof to the uniting of them, muſt be ſought and given of God, and Chriſts interceſſion made uſe of for that end; for, ſo much doth Chriſt teach us, while he prayeth, <hi>that they all may be one,</hi> 5. The union of beleevers, prayed for by Chriſt, is not every combination or conſent, even of Saints, nor a conjunction in any ſinful courſe, but it is an union in God, and in the wayes of God; for this doth Chriſt pray for, <hi>that they may be one in us.</hi> 6. The way to keep up true union among Saints, is, that they keep cloſe communion with God in Chriſt, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they be carnal, this breeds ſtrife, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. for, ſo much alſo is imported in this prayer, <hi>that they may be one in us,</hi> or, by being in us, and keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us 7. The true union of beleevers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, doth reſemble that union betwixt the Father and Son; partly, in reſpect of the ſtrictneſs of the union, that this union cometh neareſt to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible union, (though indeed it be infinitely ſhort of it,) and doth far ſurpaſſe any other conjunction; And partly, that as the Father being in the Son, and the Son in the Father, they do mutually delight each in other, as a conſequent of their union, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. ſo this union of beleevers is teſtified and entertained by ſpiritual exerciſe of mutual edification; to which alſo may be added, that from this union betwixt the Father and the Son who is our Mediatour, this union of beleevers doth flow, that they are made one in them: Therefore again doth Chriſt pray, <hi>That as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, they may be one in us</hi> 8. The true union of beleevers will not conſiſt in contemplative notions, or outward profeſſions, but ought to expreſſe it ſelf in viſible fruits; as here is ſubjoyned, <hi>that the world may beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> 9 In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The people of God then walking in an united way, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mean to convince the world of the excellency of Chriſt; and of the truth of Chriſtian Religion, and ſo either leave them inexcuſable, or convert them; whereas ſchiſmes and rents among them is a ready mean to beget and cheriſh Atheiſme in the world; for, when <hi>they are one in us, the world ſhall beleeve that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe, Chriſt (to preſſe this ſuit before the Father, and convince his Apoſtles and all beleevers of the neceſſity of this union) holds forth what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent priviledges he had conferred and allowed upon them to advance their union; even a communication of that glory given to him by the Father. Which is not to be underſtood as if the eſſential glory and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Chriſt as God, or the glory of the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union of the manhood of Chriſt to his Godhead, or of the office of Mediatour, were communicable to any other, or that any glory given to him, is communicate to any in the ſame meaſure with him: nor yet only of the glory of the Apoſtleſhip or Miniſtry committed to him. For that was given only to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, this to all beleevers; But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That as his incommunicable glory is made forth-coming for them; ſo the glory of Sonſhip, of his ſanctification without meaſure, of being on Gods ſecrets and dwelling in his boſome, and of his union with the Father, is communicate to them in its own kinde and meaſure, and they are made Sons, ſanctified in part, admitted to the knowledge of the Fathers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and to be one with the Father in him, and all this in order to their union, which alſo is a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of that glory of his unity with the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is truly glorious, having not only eſſential glory, the ſame and equal with the Fathers glory, and which was declared to be in him, by his exaltation, but our nature being exalted in him to the glory of the perſonal union, and of the offices and dignities following thereupon; for, there is <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me.</hi> 2. Chriſt is communicative of his fulneſſe to his people; all his excellencies being either communicate to them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, or daily forth-coming for them; for, <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</hi> 3. All that is in Chriſt for beleevers, or communicate to them from him, cometh by free gift, without any deſerving on their part, and ſhould be eſteemed of as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gift; for, <hi>I have given them the glory.</hi> 4. What beleevers have in and from Chriſt, doth advance them to a glorious eſtate, and is their begun glory and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo that none but they have any true glory, nor is any thing enjoyed by men truly glorious, but the grace and other priviledges they enjoy in and from him; for, it is <hi>the glory</hi> which <hi>I have given them.</hi> 5. It is not enough we know what we have in Chriſt and from him, unleſſe we alſo take up the end for which it is allowed, and emprove it accordingly; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne, <hi>I have given them that glory, that they may be one.</hi> 6. All Chriſts communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf to beleevers, doth tend to advance their union; Their union among themſelves in ſome ſort of reſemblance with that union betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him, and their union with God through him for that end, is in it ſelf a part of that glory which he giveth them; And all their participation of the fruits of that incommunicable glory which is in

Chriſt, and all that is communicate by Chriſt to them, ſhould ſit them the more for union, and make them grow in humility and mutual condeſcendence for that effect, and not puffe them up; for, <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> 7. Chriſt would have the excellency of union ſtudied, in the gloriouſneſſe thereof, in his large communications for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and in the reſemblance it hath with the union betwixt the Father and him; Therefore doth he ſo point it out here, to the conviction of all, <hi>I have given them the glory,</hi> even <hi>to be one,</hi> and <hi>that they may be one even as we are one.</hi> 8. Such as would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the welfare of Gods people, ought not only to wiſh or pray for it; but muſt alſo be active in their ſtation for promoving thereof; for, ſo much doth Chriſts practice teach, who, as he prayed for this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo he <hi>gave them the glory, that they may be one.</hi> 9. It may, upon the one hand, ſhame beleevers from divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſſention, that hereby they do what they can to deprive themſelves of that glory gifted by Chriſt, to be one as the Father and he are, and to make void the fruit of all his glorious communications; And, on the other hand, it may aſſure them who long for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Chriſt whoſe deſire and allowance it is, and who hath laid out ſo much for it, and is daily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding with the Father for that effect, will, in due time bring it about among his people; Therefore, both to ſhame his people from their contentions and neglect of union, and to preſſe his ſuit before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how averſe ſoever they be, he uſeth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe Chriſt yet inſiſts to clear &amp; preſſe his ſuit for obtaining union of beleevers among themſelves. And for this end, 1. He propounds the way of their union among themſelves, inſtancing one particular branch of that glory given them, <hi>v.</hi> 22. for that end, even u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf, and with the Father through him. Which as it is a great dignity in it ſelf, ſo it tends to the perfecting of their union among themſelves. 2. He again amplifieth and preſſeth the ſuit from the final cauſes thereof: where, unto that end formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>v.</hi> 21. of the conviction of the world of his authority and Commiſſion, another alſo is added, that hereby the world ſhall be convinced of the Fathers love to his followers, according as he loved him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt takes up an inhabitation in his people by his Spirit, ſo that they become one with him; for, it is their allowance, <hi>I in them.</hi> 2. The Father dwells in Chriſt, not only as he is one God with him, but alſo as he is man, in whom the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwells bodily; ſo highly is our nature dignified in his perſon; for, <hi>thou</hi> art <hi>in me,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Albeit there can be no union betwixt God and fallen man immediately, yet through Chriſt this union is made up: and Chriſt being in us, and we united to him, the Father alſo, in him, is in us, and we in him; for, thus is our union here with God made up, <hi>I in them, and thou in me.</hi> 4. It is by our union with Chriſt, and with God through him, that our, union among our ſelves is perfected; for, by this mean they are <hi>made perfect in one.</hi> 5. Whatever excellency the Lord conferre upon every particular beleever yet their perfection conſiſts in their union among themſelves, and with Chriſt their Head and Store-houſe, and with the Father in his fulneſſe through him; for no one member hath the perfection of the whole body, but of a part only, nor hath it that perfection ſeparate from the body, but in it, and being united with it, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its own proper function; and the whole body thus united, hath its perfection in and from Chriſt and the Father; for, ſo doth Chriſts conjoyning of all theſe teach us: <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may he made perfect in one.</hi> 6. It is never enough ſtudied, how neceſſary union is, to convince the world of the excellency of Chriſt and his doctrine; therefore it is again repeated, as a forcible argument preſſing this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> And as the Apoſtles union and conſent in doctrine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>id contribute to this end, ſo alſo doth the union of the people of God in every age, in its own meaſure. 7. It tends to the great encouragement of beleevers, that Chriſt their Surety is beloved and accepted of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, <hi>thou haſt loved me,</hi> ſaith he. 8. Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever alſo is really beloved of the Father; ſo that whatever he do unto them, there is ſtill love in it, and they keep a room in his affection, for, <hi>thou haſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them,</hi> ſaith he. 9. The Fathers love to beleevers doth reſemble his love to his Son Chriſt; for though his love to his eternal and only Son be matchleſſe and neceſſary, not voluntary, us his love to us is; nor are we loved for our own ſakes, as he is; nor is he capable of ſome effects of love we receive; yet this love doth moſt reſemble it of any; and albeit, conſidering him as Mediatour, there is a great difference betwixt us who are beloved, and him for whoſe ſake we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The love of God toward ſonne of fallen mankinde is ſuch, as ought not to be concealed, but Chriſt would have it publiſhed, to the conviction or converſion of others; Therefore he would have <hi>the world know that thou haſt loved them.</hi> 11. Union among beleevers is ſo great a work of God, evidencing ſo much of his care and love; and is the condition upon which he raines ſo many ſhowres of bleſſings and mercies, that it ſerves exceedingly to convince the world of Gods love to them, when they are thus united, and are reaping the fruits thereof; for, hereby <hi>the world ſhall know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe is contained another ſute put up by Chriſt in behalfe of all his people; Wherein, having prayed for their ſpiritual union among themſelves, and for union with him and with the Father through him; he now prayeth for their union in place with himſelfe in heaven at laſt, and deſcribeth the bleſſed eſtate of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in heaven. 1. From their company, that they ſhall be with him where he is. 2. From their exerciſe, which ſhall be to behold that glory given unto him, which is further commended from the fountain cauſe thereof, even the Fathers eternal love to him. Of this glory of Chriſt compare <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a ſweet way to keep our hearts freſh and lively in prayer, when we have many thoughts of that tender relation betwixt God, to whom we pray, and us; Therefore Chriſt, who began his prayer with the ſweet ſtile of <hi>Father,</hi> v. 1. doth ſo often repeat the ſame, <hi>v.</hi> 11, here, and <hi>v.</hi> 25. that the thoughts of that relation might ſweeten his heart, and renew his ardour and affection. 2. The thoughts and hope of eternal life ought and will warne beleevers hearts toward God, and excite much alacrity and affection in them; for, ſo much alſo doth Chriſts practice reach, who beginning to ſpeak of his glory flowing from the Fathers love, and of heaven and eternal life to be conferred upon all his followers, his heart warmeth, and he breaketh out with that ſweet compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Father.</hi> 3. While Chriſt expreſſeth his petition in theſe tearmes, <hi>I will,</hi> it doth not import any imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commanding way, repugnant to his former way of humble ſupplication; But it only imports that in this his ſupplication, he was making his latter Will and Teſtament and leaving his legacies, which he was ſure would be effectual, being purchaſed by his effectual merits, and proſecuted by his affectionate and earneſt requeſts and interceſſion, all which are imported in this expreſſion. And ſo it teacheth us, That as all theſe things ſought in this prayer, are beleevers duty to ſtudy after them; So are they Chriſts legacies, purchaſed and earneſtly prayed for by him, which will certainly be forth-coming to them: for ſaith he concerning them, <hi>I will</hi> that they be. 4. Chriſt is very deſirous and much taken up with his peoples fellowſhip and company, ſo that before he remove his bodily preſence from them, his heart is upon meeting and fellowſhip again; As here we ſee in his prayer before his departure. And this he maketh evident from day to day, in that, until that time of meeting come, two or three are not gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his name, but he is in the midſt of them. 5. Spiritual communion with Chriſt, will, at laſt, end in glory, and in communion with him in place in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Chriſt will never reſt ſatisfied till their begun communion be thus perfected; And however the world and our hearts do, oft-times, look on ſpiritual communion but as a fancy; Yet heaven ſhall confirme the reality thereof, and that it was to good purpoſe to beleeve and wait on: And what difficulties we finde in entertaining communion here, ſhall then be removed, and we ſhall get Chriſt converſed with without an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. Therefore, unto the former way of union among themſelves, and with him, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. this union in place is ſubjoyned. 6. Such as have attained to ſpiritual communion with Chriſt, and are growing therein, will long after the compleating thereof in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and after union in place with him; As here Chriſts practice and method doth teach, who after praying for the former, doth aſcend higher, to pray for this alſo. 7. As it is only the elect who are given to Chriſt, that do attain ſalvation, and all they do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain it; So whatever preparations Chriſt work in them in order to their ſalvation; Yet as free love is the fountain, ſo it is alſo the perfecter of their ſalvation, and grace will be as free in a ſaved mans account, the laſt hour, as the firſt; Therefore, in this ſute, Chriſt doth only deſigne them, <hi>they whom thou haſt given me,</hi> to intimate, not only, that only ſuch and all ſuch do attain ſalvation, but alſo that this is to be looked to as the great cauſe and fountain of their ſalvation, as well as of their converſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, 37. So much alſo doth he intimate by his praying for their ſalvation, as well as for their converſion. 8. The glory and happineſſe of heaven to the Elect will conſiſt much in being in Chriſts compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in whom they belight ſo much on earth; to follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth, and to enjoy him fully, without ſeparation any more; for, ſo is heaven here deſcribed in Chriſts prayer, <hi>that they may be with me where I am,</hi> though not ſecluding the Father in this nor in what followeth, with whom we are through the Son. 9. Chriſt, the Head of beleevers, is now truly glorious and highly exalted in heaven; His glory being openly declared as God, and he put in poſſeſſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as man: for, ſaith he, there is <hi>my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> 10. Whatever wayes of Chriſts glory be made manifeſt, to beleevers on earth, in his Church and his manifeſtations to them; yet it cannot be fully ſeen on this ſide of time, ſo tranſcendent and infinite is it; for, it is not till <hi>they be with me where I am,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>behold my glory.</hi> 11. The day is coming wherein beleevers ſhall be compleatly happy in a ſight of Chriſts glory, when he ſhall be conſpicuouſly glorified and admired in his Saints, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. and glorified by them; and when, all veils being laid aſide, and they fitted for a more full fruition, ſhall viſibly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly behold and enjoy him; Therefore is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in heaven deſcribed as conſiſting in this, <hi>that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> 12. Spiritual and heavenly mercies are then rightly ſeen and acknowledged, when Gods love, as the fountain thereof, affects their heart; for, ſo much doth Chriſts practice teach us, who ſpeaking of the glory given him, doth fall out in a commendation of that love whence it flowed, <hi>for thou lovedſt me.</hi> 13. Chriſt the Mediator is beloved of the Father with an everlaſting love, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in his exalting of him in glory, that ſo ſinners may expect to be accepted in him; for, ſaith he, <hi>Thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi>

                  <p>In the cloſe of this ſolemne prayer, Chriſt, having prayed that his people may be glorified with him, doth (in the mean time, till they come to that bleſſed ſtate) recommend them to the participation of that love, wherewith himſelfe was loved, and to his own inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Which deſire he grounds upon their condition oppoſite to the world, and that they were ſeparate from the worlds faſhions; For whereas the world doth not know God, nor acknowledge him as they ought; Yet it was not ſo with them. However (as is imported) they knew not the Father fully, yet he knew him, and they knew Chriſt to be the Fathers Ambaſſadour; And he had revealed the Father to them in ſome meaſure, and would reveal him yet more, that ſo they might partake of theſe mercies deſired. This deſire is not ſo much propounded prayer-wiſe, as by way of confident aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that he ſhould obtain from his righteous Father what he deſired to them, conſidering what they were, and what he would make them; Hereby yet further aſſuring us of his ſucceſſe with the Father in the work of interceſſion. It is alſo to be marked, that however this ſute have place for all beleevers, when they are brought to that condition here mentioned; Yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that here, Chriſt ſpeaks expreſſely of theſe to whom he had already revealed the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 26.—we are to conceive that, in the firſt place, he points at his Apoſtles already converted, and that he would cloſe his prayer with a word yet again more expreſſely in their behalfe, for their encouragement. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath ſo large an heart, and ſo diſtinct an eye upon his people, that at once, without any diſtraction, he can be taken up with his whole Church, and yet not forget any particular member or ſociety of his people; And he hath ſuch a care of every one, as if he had no moe to care for but that one; for here, in praying for all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, he brings out a word more expreſſely for the Apoſtles, to let them ſee how one thought and care doth not juſtle out another with him. 2. In our prayers we ought to ground our ſelves well upon the knowledge of God in his attributes; That as we may be aſhamed to ſeek ſuch things as beſeem not ſuch a God to give, ſo we may be encouraged in what we are allowed to ſeek; Therefore doth Chriſt give this title to God, <hi>righteous Father,</hi> it being a righteous and approven petition, and God who is righteous engaged to Chriſt and to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in him, by his promiſe, to grant it. 3. Chriſt is a ſupplicant, who according to the tenour of the paction betwixt the Father and him, can face the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and juſtice on our behalfe, and be ſure to come ſpeed; Therefore alſo doth he deſigne him <hi>righteous Father,</hi> expecting that in righteouſneſs he could not be refuſed. 4. Albeit the compleat happineſs of beleevers be laid up in heaven, yet Chriſt allowes enough for their through-bearing, till they come there; As here we ſee in this large allowance till that ſute, <hi>v.</hi> 24. be granted. 5. The love of God in Chriſt, and the enjoyment of an intereſt and communion with him, is ſufficient for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers encouragement, till they arrive at full fruition in heaven; for, that, in particular, is their allowance here. 6. As Chriſt the Mediator is dearly beloved of the Father, ſo he is a ſtorehouſe thereof and a conduit to conveigh that love to his people; for, ſo is his deſire here, <hi>that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them.</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 23. 7. It is Chriſts allowance and deſire, that not only his people be beloved of the Father, but that they have the faith and lively feeling thereof, to refreſh their hearts, and drive away clouds and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; for, it is his deſire that his love may be <hi>in them,</hi> and they poſſeſſe it, and feele it, and dwell in it, and feed upon it. 8. It is by being and abiding in Chriſt that beleevers come to partake and poſſeſſe the love of the Father; and when they wander away from him, it is no wonder if a cloud come over their good condition; Therefore are theſe conjoyned, <hi>That the love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be in them, and I in them.</hi> 9. Chriſt is ſo tender and liberal toward his people, that he communicateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with all he giveth them; His love (ſo to ſay) being given over again with his love, and his heart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with all he beſtoweth: For this cauſe alſo are they conjoyned, <hi>The love in them, and I in them,</hi> to ſhew that he giveth himſelf with that love which is laid up in him, to be derived through him to them. 10. As Chriſt knoweth to whom he prayeth, ſo he knoweth well, who and what they are for whom he prayeth, and on whoſe behalfe the Father will hear him; And he would have all his people, who expect the benefit of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, to make ſure their acquaintance with God, and their ſeparation from the evil manners of the world: Therefore, as he takes up a <hi>righteous Father</hi> in this ſute, ſo he recommends theſe he prayeth for, as not like the world, who <hi>have not known the Father,</hi> to teach us, That however he intercede for the Elect who know him not, that they may know him; Yet none but ſuch as this change is wrought upon, can make comfortable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the benefit of his interceſſion. 11. It is the great ſin of the world and men unconverted, that they do not know God, whatever they pretend: What they ſeem to know, is but by hear-ſay, they have no ſolid impreſſion of it; They do not know God in Chriſt practically and ſavingly, and therefore all they know beſide is nothing; They do not affect and love God, and true knowledge in Scripture language imports alſo affection; and, They do not practice what they know, and ſo are but really ignorant. For theſe cauſes, and in theſe reſpects, it is ſaid, <hi>The world hath not known thee.</hi> 12. As Gods ſoveraignty doth ſhine in with-holding the knowledge of himſelfe from whom he pleaſeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. So alſo his righteouſneſs is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in it: For the world doth not love to know God, and therefore juſtly are they filled with their own waies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. They will not be at pains to know him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. And what wonder they ſuffer hunger becauſe of their idleneſſe? and, They abuſe what light they have, and therefore it is juſtly taken from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.—24. &amp;c. Therefore, as in other reſpects before mentioned, ſo in this reſpect alſo, he is called
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48148:187"/>
                     <hi>righteous Father,</hi> in that <hi>the world hath not known him,</hi> 13. Albeit the world do not know nor acknowledge God, yet he is content with the acknowledgement he gets among his people; and it is their commendation that they do know him, when ſo many are ignorant of him: In both theſe reſpects is their condition here held out and commended to the Father, in oppoſition to the world. 14. The beſt of Saints within time will finde no perfect oppoſition betwixt the world and them in themſelves, but only in Chriſt, and what he is for them and for their behoofe; Therefore, to ſupply their defect in knowledge, (which is here ſuppoſed) the oppoſition begins with this, <hi>but I have known thee.</hi> 15. Chriſt doth perfectly know the Father, that he may cover and rectifie all our ignorance, in our uptaking of him, and addreſſes to him; and that he may be aſſured he will give no falſe character of him: for, it is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the diſciples behoofe and advantage, <hi>I have known thee.</hi> 16, Whatever degrees of ignorance Saints lye under, yet it doth commend them to God, if they know Chriſt as Mediator and Ambaſſador of the Father, and ſo know God in Chriſt, and in order to ſalvation; for, in this, Chriſt commends his rude diſciples, <hi>theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. 17. What ever meaſure of knowledge of God, beleevers have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, it cometh all from Chriſt; who is the fountain of all the light the Church receives; and, who only can manifeſt him truely and ſavingly unto ſinners; for, ſo doth he commend their weak knowledge from the cauſe of it, <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name.</hi> 18. As what Chriſt hath been, or is, that he will ſtill be, to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; (for, <hi>I have declared, and will declare,</hi> ſaith he) So he is an undertaker to his Father for his people, and engageth himſelfe to be forth-coming for what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them; that ſo their imperfections may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of his allowance: Therefore, that they may not be deprived of what here he deſireth to them, he undertakes for what they want, <hi>I have declared, and will declare it</hi> 19. Albeit the knowledge and grace of beleevers be but ſmall, yet if it be growing, it will not want the reward of a larger meaſure; Therefore doth he undertake for the encreaſe of their knowledge, <hi>I will declare thy Name,</hi> that upon this conſideration they may be admitted to pertake of this prayed for mercy. 20. Chriſt hath ſo abſolute power over the hearts and underſtandings of his people, that he can when he pleaſeth, break in with light upon them, and cauſe their hearts take with it; for, he undertakes, <hi>I will declare thy Name,</hi> which is not only a promiſe that he will afford ſufficient means, but alſo that he will effectually make them know the Father, and ſo put them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for receiving this deſired mercy, which the offer and having opportunity of means could not do. 21. As the true knowledge of God in Chriſt is an evidence that men are converted, and ſo have acceſſe to the poſſeſſion of the Fathers love, and communion with Chriſt; So, in particular, the true knowledge of him will beget ſaith in him and love to him, whereby the ſenſe and aſſurance of his love is made clear to their hearts: In both theſe reſpects doth Chriſt on theſe grounds recommend them to the Fathers love, <hi>I have declared thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the love may be in them,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe this knowledge did evidence them to be converted, and ſo to have right to this love, and becauſe it did put them in a neer capacity and fitneſſe to partake of the ſenſe and fruits thereof. And ſo their poſſeſſion of this love depends and followeth upon this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

He came there well guarded, to take him, <hi>v.</hi> 3. I need not here inſiſt to deſcribe this garden, nor yet to ſhew that as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned in a garden, ſo Chriſt would ſuffer in a garden, to expiate the guilt of this ſin in all his people. But we may from <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of Chriſts followers, not to expect alwayes ſo ſweet a life as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, communicating and prayer, but to lay their account that after ſuch exerciſes, they may be called to ſuffer, and after fair blenks, may meet with black ſtormes; for, ſo much doth Chriſts example teach, who, <hi>when he had ſpoken theſe words,</hi> (in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, and had inſtiſtute and celebrate the Supper) <hi>he went forth,</hi> &amp;c. to his trial. 2. Such as have committed themſelves to God, and leſt any of whom they have charge, on him, may very ſafely leave them in the midſt of hazards, and themſelves hazard to look trouble in the face; for, more particularly, <hi>When Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words,</hi> (in the former prayer, wherein he had prayed to the Father for himſelfe, and left his diſciples upon him) <hi>he went forth</hi> to encounter death, and is not affraid to be taken from his diſciples, and leave them in the world, ſince he had put them in ſo ſure a hand. 3. It is the duty of the Lords people to be reſolute in undergoing ſuffering, and to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves voluntarily to God, to underly it, in ſo far as they have a calling; And herein Chriſt is an eminent pattern, who <hi>went forth over the brook Cedron</hi> (a little brook running betwixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the mount of Olives, of which ſee 2 <hi>King</hi> 23.6. and elſewhere) and <hi>entred into the garden,</hi> where he was to meet with ſeveral conflicts. 4. His taking <hi>his diſciples with him,</hi> and their following of him, may ſerve to teach; Partly, how affectionatly Chriſt is to be followed, when he is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of his departure; for, on their part it imports their hanging on him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22 39. as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did on <hi>Elijah</hi> till the fiery chariot parted them. Partly, That we ſhould be thrifty in ſpending every moment of our time, whatever encumbrances we have; for, Chriſt in all this throng, took them with him, that by the way he might informe them of their ſcattering, and appoint the meeting place after his reſurrection, as it is recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31, 32. Partly, That Chriſt hath ſanctified in his own perſon, the deſolate and low condition of his people, wherein they would be glad of the meaneſt encouragement, even from the company of weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet cannot have it; for, he alſo took them with him that they might watch with him in his agony, wherein yet they diſappointed him, as is recorded <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38, 40. And partly, That as naturally we are averſe from trouble, eſpecially from ſuffering for Chriſt; So it is his peoples duty to train and breed themſelves for ſuch lots, both by the obſervation of the courage of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. and 12.1. (which, no doubt, made many in the primitive times ſo ſtout) and by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own weakneſſe in leſſer aſſayes, that being humbled thereby, they may put themſelves in Chriſts hand, who may make notable inſtruments of theſe who at firſt are very weak; Therefore alſo did he take them with him, not that they might ſuffer at this time, but that they might be bred for their after ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by beholding his courage and power, and by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a taſte of their own weakneſſe, to make them more ſelfe-denied, and eager to recover themſelves at another time. 5. Such as would bear out under trial and perſecution, ought not to be found ſleeping, but in the firſt place ſhould make all ſure with God, that trial do not ſurprize them, while they have not entreated the face of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12. Therefore alſo doth he <hi>enter into the Garden,</hi> that there he may endure his agony, and wraſtle with his Father, before <hi>Judas</hi> came, as is cleared by the reſt.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As it is our duty to be very diligent with God when troubles are eminent or incumbent; So we ought not to leave all to the pinch of extremity, but ſhould be making ready before-hand; for, <hi>Jeſus oft-times reſorted thither with his diſciples.</hi> See <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.37. and 22.39. And this he did, not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48148:188"/>
only to ſanctifie unto his followers ill entertainment, notwithſtanding the ſervices they do to the world, as he preached all day, and yet lay in the fields all night, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.37. or, to ſanctifie eſſayes of hazards and trials, whereby they are fitted for greater trouble when it cometh; as he was long before ſo purſued, as he could not conveniently lodge by night in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> But further, he did this, that in the night time he might give himſelf there to prayer, (as was his cuſtome,) <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3.) and that before his Agony came. 2. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ought not to ruſh upon trials without a calling, ſo they ought not timerouſly to decline them, but ſhould ſet their face toward them, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.32. for he went where <hi>Judas knew the place,</hi> to ſhew that as he would not run to <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo he would not go out of his uſual way, though he knew his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would afford him an advantage. 3. Chriſt may be perſecuted by men who have been very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his ſervice; even by one of his twelve Apoſtles, as <hi>Judas</hi> was, and by them who in their office were types of himſelf, ſuch as the <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> were. And this ſhould prevent our ſtumbling at the defection of ſuch, and by this all are warned, that were they never ſo eminent, or had ſtood never ſo long, yet they ought to take heed of an entertained idol, leſt that draw them in the ſnare, as theſe Prieſts were by their credit, and <hi>Judas</hi> by his love to the world. 4. Wicked apoſtates and perſecutors are not aſleep in their deſignes and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but are very vigilant and active, when, it may be, Chriſts followers are aſleep and careleſſe; for, in the dark night <hi>Judas cometh</hi> with his crew, and that at the time when Chriſt could not get his diſciples kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, as is recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.45, 46, 47. 5. Chriſt will not ſtand to let perſecutors have all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages of him, that ſo his victory over them may be more conſpicuous; for, therefore is there a <hi>Judas</hi> who knew his retiring places, to lead out a <hi>band of men,</hi> (of theſe Romanes who kept the Tower next the Temple, whether with <hi>Pilates</hi> conſent or not, is not needful to determine) and <hi>officers</hi> or <hi>ſervants from the chief Prieſts and Phariſees,</hi> and that <hi>with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, and torches, and weapons.</hi> And all this againſt Chriſt him alone. They made uſe of <hi>lanternes and torches,</hi> although it was full moon at the time of the feaſt, that ſo they might be ſure to finde him out. 6. Perſecutors want not their own feares and toſſings, in the violent courſes they undertake againſt Chriſt and his people; but may have, ofttimes, more perplexity, then the ſufferers have in bearing what they are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inflict; for, therefore alſo was it that <hi>Judas</hi> came, and they ſent him thus attended and provided; even out of fear leſt the matter ſhould miſcarry.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond thing premitted to Chriſts taking in the Garden, is, a conference betwixt him and them who came to take him. The conference is twofold, or the ſame conference twice repeated, in order to his twofold ſcope in it. His ſcope in the firſt conference (in theſe verſes) is, to give a proof of his Deity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this his low condition, as may be gathered from the progreſſe. In it we may conſider, 1. The poſture wherein Chriſt was at their coming, <hi>v.</hi> 4.— which was the cauſe of his ſo couragious going out to them, and his conferring ſo mildly with them; where it is to be conceived, as is recorded by the reſt, that he is now a little eaſed of his Agony, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. and that (as is here recorded) he ſaw clearly through all the ſufferings he was to meet with, and ſo is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his minde. 2. The conference it ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. wherein, enquiring and getting an account that they were ſeeking Jeſus, he meekly informes that it was he. 3. The effect that followed upon this declaration, <hi>v.</hi> 6. his meek word is accompanied with ſo much divine power, that upon the hearing thereof, they fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the ground.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Peace with God in a trial will make all the reſt of the trial, in ſo far as it is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, very eaſie; for, his ſtout and meek <hi>going forth</hi> to encounter trouble, followeth upon his eaſe of his Agony. 2. The Lord can ſo order the exerciſes of his people, as however they may have heavy preſſures upon their minde; yet he can intermit the extremity thereof when they need ſtrength for outward difficulties, and let it return again when the ſtrait is over; for, ſo it ſeemeth did he deal with his Son, who though he had an inward Agony all the while of his paſſion, yet the violence thereof is intermitted in the Garden, when they came to him, and we hear no more of it till they leave him on the Croſſe, where again he is made to cry out of it. 3. The conſideration of the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of trouble, in Gods providence, ought to make us willingly ſtoop thereunto; eſpecially, when we have taſted of former gracious deliverances and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, we ought to ſtoop when his houre cometh, and not ſeek alwayes to be free; for, <hi>Jeſus therefore knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth;</hi> That is, knowing that this was the time of his ſuffering, and that now he was not to be preſerved and hid as formerly, he went forth to them, and not away, as at other times he had done. 4. There is nothing makes us more readily to be daſhed with trouble, then our not knowing or conſidering what trouble is: when we miſrepreſent trouble, it terrifieth, but when we look, not only on the neceſſity and inevitableneſſe, but on the uſefulneſſe, meaſure, and event of it, it will appear much more tolerable, and rather a friend then an enemy; for, ſo much alſo is imported in this, <hi>Jeſus knowing all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such as are at peace with God, and have ſeen through their ſufferings, will be in a very compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed frame, and at themſelves, in the height thereof;

for, this conference and enquiry, <hi>Whom ſeek ye?</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not any ignorance or curioſity, but, that on his part, he was meek and compoſed, his Agony being ſomewhat ſetled, and he ſeeing through his trouble. 6. It concernes perſecutors to take good heed what they are doing, and eſpecially to conſider with whom they have to do, and againſt whom their attempts are; for, this queſtion, <hi>Whom ſeek ye?</hi> as to them, imports that they ſhould have conſidered whom they were ſeeking, which if they had well conſidered, they had not done as they did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. 7. The Lord, when he pleaſeth, can hide and preſerve his people, not only among li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and in ſires, but even in the midſt of their foes; for, their anſwer importeth, that at firſt, albeit <hi>Judas</hi> ſtood with them, yet they knew him not, otherwiſe they had not ſo ſpoken, we <hi>ſeek Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> but we <hi>ſeek thee.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.11. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.18, 19, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.26. 8.

Chriſt our Lord did not ſhift trouble, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offered himſelf when he was ſought in his peoples ſtead, that ſo enemies might blame themſelves if they were not ſatisfied; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I am he,</hi> and ſhifts it not. 10. It is ſubjoyned to this anſwer, that <hi>Judas which betrayed him, ſtood with them,</hi> not only to point out Chriſts meekneſſe, who gives this anſwer, though provoked by his preſence. And to point out the Providence of God, who hid him that he could not be known, though <hi>Judas</hi> was with them. But further it points out, That Apoſtates will grow very impudent, and that this is taken notice of by Chriſt; Therefore, it is marked, that in this black courſe, <hi>Judas</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>ſtood with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>v,</hi> 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It was not the power of men prevailing over Chriſt, but his own willingneſſe, that brought him to ſuffer; nor would Chriſt have any thing to out ſhine his affection in his ſufferings; Therefore before he is taken, he cauſeth them <hi>go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fall to the ground,</hi> to teſtifie that they could not have taken him, unleſſe he had conſented to it. 2. It is a very dreadful and terrible thing to be in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Chriſt, how con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beleevers may expect that much of divine power will be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon and about them, in their ſufferings; for, ſo did Chriſt their forerunner finde in his ſufferings. 4. Proofs of Gods power are to be expected by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not ſo much to exempt them from ſuffering and trouble; as (beſide their being inwardly ſupported thereby) to convince enemies, if poſſible, and to let ſee what he can do, if it were needful; for, ſuch was the proof Chriſt got here, in that <hi>they went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> whereby he convinced them of the evil of their way, and how ineffectual he could make it, if he pleaſed, though he let the trial go on. 5. The Word of Chriſt, how contemptible ſoever it ſeem to be, is full of Majeſty, and accompanied with divine power, and terrour to his enemies, when he pleaſeth to let it out; for, <hi>Aſſoon as he ſaid to them I am he, they went backward, &amp;c.</hi> And if his Lambs voice was ſo terrible, how dreadful will he be, when he roares as a Lion? and if that ſweet word, <hi>I am he,</hi> which comforted the diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 6.20. be their terrour, how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible will it be, when he ſpeaks to them as they deſerve?</p>

Chriſt himſelf is the great Butt of perſecutors malice; ſo long as he was in the world the ſtream of their malice ran againſt him, and when they aſſault his followers, it is becauſe they cannot reach him. He is firſt hated of the world, and they for his ſake, and could the world reach him in heaven, they would not much trouble themſelves with his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for, ſo much may be gathered from their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>we ſeek Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> being compared with what Chriſt makes out of it, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that the diſciples muſt be free, as not minded by them, nor put in their Commiſſion by theſe who ſent them. 3.

                     </gap>ing of his diſciples, if there had not been a commanding power with it to bound them, as it did. 5. Chriſts offering of himſelf to undergo his bitter ſufferings, doth indeed exempt his people from the like; and he goeth betwixt them and all ſtormes in ſo far as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying: for, ſo much may be gathered from his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in this particular, <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way.</hi> Albeit he do not exempt his followers from outward troubles, as he did the diſciples at that time; yet his offering himſelf unto, and underlying that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death, did exempt them, and all his own, from that puniſhment due to ſin, and ſatisfaction required by juſtice for it. So that when juſtice challengeth them, they may ſend it to Chriſt who was taken for them all. And as for outward afflictions, all that they meet with are but ſome few drops, ſanctified and ſweetned to them, by his eſſaying of that lot before them. 6. Chriſt is ſo tender of his followers, that he will not put them to any trial, till they be ripe and fitted for it; ſo that when he ſends a trial, we are to reckon that we will be enabled for it, if it were but becauſe he ſends it, provided we do not caſt away our ſtrength, nor ſin it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us; for, therefore would he have them <hi>let theſe go their way</hi> for this time, becauſe they were but yet weak, till after his reſurrection, that the Spirit was poured out upon them. 7. Chriſt is a faithful Keeper and Performer of his Word, and they are not ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, who have but his naked word to uphold and aſſure their hearts in greateſt extremities; for, this was alſo a reaſon why he would exempt them at this time, <hi>That the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake, Of them which thou gaveſt me, I have loſt none.</hi> 8. What Chriſt hath done for his people, may be looked on as a pledge of what he will ſtill do, according as they need; for, that account which Chriſt makes of his by-paſt diligence, <hi>ch.</hi> 17.12. is here looked on as a promiſe <hi>to be fulfilled</hi> in their preſervation at this time alſo. And that not only becauſe in that paſſage he gave an account of his whole care till his removal from them, and ſo of this alſo, though not yet manifeſted, but alſo, that we may be aſſured that he will never change his way with his people, ſo long as they need it. 9. That ſweet word, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.12. is here applied to bodily preſervation from an outward trouble, though it chiefly point at their ſouls preſervation from the evil, as he explains it, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.15. when he prayes for the continuance of that preſervation from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe that not only during the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, he did indeed hide them from outward troubles, as here was verified. But further, in ſparing them outwardly at this time, he had alſo a reſpect to their ſouls, which might have been cruſhed, had they been engaged in trial, as <hi>Peters</hi> experience makes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And ſo it teacheth, That as to tender the body and outward man with prejudice to the ſoul, is great cruelty: ſo where Chriſt vndertakes the charge of mens ſoule, he will alſo have a care of their body and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, in ſubſerviencie to their ſoules welfare. He will reſpect their very bodies and outward man, and will not expoſe them to hazards, ſave when it is for their ſouls good, and when he is to get ſervice thereby, And he will make it evident at laſt, that he is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of their bodies, nor caſts them away, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them to ſuffering.</p>

                  <p>The third thing premitted to Chriſts taking and binding, is, his reprehenſion of <hi>Peters</hi> raſh behaviour. Chriſt being a taking (as it is, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.46, 47.) the diſciples enquire if they ſhould fight, and before Chriſt return an anſwer, <hi>Peter,</hi> in his furious zeal, breaks forth, (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.49, 50.) and cuts off the right ear of one of the ſervants of the High Prieſt, whoſe name is here recorded, for further confirmation of the truth of the Hiſtory. This carriage Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, bidding <hi>Peter</hi> put up his ſword, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a fitter time, to be employed in any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hands, but to teach him, that theſe were not his weapons. And whereas the other Evangeliſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſeveral reaſons of this reproof and command; (Namely, that this fact was without the bounds of his calling; That he needed not ſuch poor ſhifts, having other help enough, if it were needful; That he would not have the Scripture made a liar; and, That he ought to ſuffer this far, being not yet hardly handled, or ſuffer them to go ſo far as God hath permitted them; all which are held out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.52, 53, 54. <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 51.) The beloved diſciple takes moſt notice of that reaſon wherein love ſhined ſo conſpicuouſly; That he would drink that cup of affliction which the Father had given him to drink for the good of his people.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men may do things which ſeem to ſpeak much zeal and affection to Chriſt, which yet are full of droſſe, and reprovable before him; for, albeit it was great ſtoutneſſe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to offer their ſervice to Chriſt againſt the whole band, with their two ruſty blades, and in <hi>Peter,</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life among them; yet Chriſts entertainment of this offered ſervice ſheweth how unſavoury it was. 2. It is a great fault in men, to run upon a ſervice to which they have no calling, did the ſervice ſeem to ſpeak never ſo much zeal; for, it was <hi>Peters</hi> fault, being a private man, to run to a ſword to fight for his Maſter. 3. It is a great blemiſh in men, not to be ſolid, but full of flaſhes, and ſudden violent reſolutions and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which as they ordinarily drive men to debord in going about that which is right, ſo they oft-times end in as great an extremity of turning their back on what is right; for, this was alſo <hi>Peters</hi> fault: Others of them (no doubt) had as much love to Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt, and as much valour as he, had they been called to ſhew it; But he was a raſh and forward man, ſoon ſet on foot
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48148:189"/>
to what ſeemed good, but with much of his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and wrath, which worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God, and aſſoon driven to an extremity of fear and fainting, as afterward we will finde. 4. Men cannot go right (whatever their way, or zeal in it, ſeem to be) who wait not upon direction, but either neglect to ſeek it, or having ſought it, do neglect to wait for his light, and run the way unto which their own ſpirits encline; for, ſo alſo did <hi>Peter</hi> here, all of them having enquired at Chriſt, he prevents an anſwer by following his own inclination, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 5. It is a great evidence of mens diſtempers, when they will not learn to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſuffering, but would repel one injury with another: when all the out-gate of trials they look for, is how to bear them down, or fall upon the inflicters of them, but know not that to ſuffer and ſtoop is an out-gate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19, 20, 21. for, this alſo was <hi>Peters</hi> fault, that he could fight, but not ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is a great ſigne of Chriſts love, that he reproves his people for their faults; for, he reproves not <hi>Judas</hi> and the band ſo ſharply, (though he give them a check, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53) as he doth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Then ſaid Jeſus unto Peter, put up thy ſword into the ſheath, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Afflictions are meaſured by God to his people, both for quantity and quality: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are they called <hi>a Cup,</hi> which, as it is a comfort to the godly, that their lot is in a friends hand, ſo it may terrifie the wicked, whoſe lot is alſo carved out, and who will not get ſo much affliction as they pleaſe; but ſo much as the juſtice of God ſeeth meet to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75 8. 3. It may ſweeten the lot of Chriſt and his followers, that even the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt potions come not from God as a Judge, but as a Father: for, even all that Chriſt drank (and it was very bitter) was <hi>the Cup which my Father hath given me.</hi> 4. Subjection unto God doth well become his people, and to ſee them endure that willingly, which he calls them unto; for, by this means the croſſe is made ſweet, whereas rebellion and want of ſubjection is the very curſe of croſſes; Therefore doth Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo eminent in ſubjection; <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 39, 45. 5. Love to God, and faith in his love, will make any condition carved out by him, ſweet to us, and us ſubmiſſive to undergo it; conſidering that nothing but good can be expected from him, who is goodneſſe and love it ſelfe; for, ſo doth Chriſt argue, <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> His love to his Father, and his ſeeing him a Father in it, made him ſtoop to it. 6. Chriſt did ſo love his Father, and to ſuffer for his people, as he would not be hindred to ſuffer, but drank that cup heartily, as minding to be often refreſhed with his peoples love to him again, who had ſo loved them; for, when <hi>Peter</hi> did what he could to impede his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, he ſaith, <hi>Should I not drink that Cup?</hi> 7. Such as would entertain ſubmiſſion in bearing hard lots, ought to repel all thoughts of outgate and eaſe, and hold their eye ſtill upon their trial, leſt ſquint-looks toward a poſſibility or probability of deliverance, do blunt their reſolutions; Therefore doth Chriſt repel any thing that <hi>Peter,</hi> by his carriage, might ſuggeſt of eſcaping that danger, <hi>Should I not drink the Cup?</hi> See alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23.</p>

The Parentheſis in our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which hath no ground in the Original, and is contrary to the way of placing it in our old Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) would ſeem to imply that <hi>Annas</hi> was he, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before this time had this office, and was before <hi>Caiaphas</hi> in dignity, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2. And afterward we finde him in office, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.6. But for clearing of it; in general, it need not ſtumble us that we finde in Scripture both of them called High Prieſts at once. For in the Jewiſh Church the High Prieſt, (called alſo the <hi>chief Prieſt</hi>) had his <hi>Sagan,</hi> or deputy, who in caſe of his infirmity or pollution, did miniſter for him, and is called the ſecond Prieſt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.24. and ſo both of them might be in place at once. Now in particular, not only the Jewiſh hiſtory, but the Scripture it ſelf makes it apparent, that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the High or chief Prieſt at that time; for, ſo he is called, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.49 and here alſo, the parentheſis being laid aſide, 1. Therefore alſo it is that Chriſt is ſent by <hi>Annas</hi> to him, <hi>v.</hi> 24. as to the High Prieſt, and it is before him, and the Councel convened in his houſe, (as the other Evangeliſts record) that Chriſt is examined and condemned, whereas the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel might have been convened at <hi>Annas</hi> houſe, had he been in chief office. So the meaning of <hi>v.</hi> 13. is only this, That Chriſt being taken is brought firſt to <hi>Annas</hi> his houſe; partly, as being neareſt to them, and partly, out of reſpect to him, as having been ſometime High Prieſt, and now father in law to the High Prieſt; and to refreſh him with a ſpectacle ſo grateful to him, ſeeing (as may be gathered from <hi>v.</hi> 24.) he went not to the Councel himſelf, but ſent Chriſt thither. Conſider, 2. As for the place wherein <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, and Chriſt was examined before the High Prieſt, Albeit <hi>John</hi> do inſert <hi>Peters</hi> firſt fall, and part of Chriſts examination, before he mention that he was ſent to <hi>Caiaphas, v.</hi> 24. and ſo ſhould ſeem to paſſe over any thing he endured in the hall of <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be all one, as to the truth of the doctrine in it ſelf, whether theſe things fell out in <hi>Annas</hi> or <hi>Caiaphas</hi>

hall: Yet the other Evangeliſts make it clear (ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.57, 58. &amp;c.) that theſe things were done before <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and in his hall. And we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Chriſt being brought to <hi>Annas,</hi> he ſent him immediatly to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> his houſe where the Councel was conveened, where <hi>Peter</hi> denied him, and he was examined. And ſo that <hi>v.</hi> 24, is immediatly to be ſubjoyned to <hi>v.</hi> 13. it being ſubjoyned there to his examination, not as done after that, but only th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t <hi>John</hi> may clear how Chriſt came to be examined before the high Prieſt, even becauſe <hi>Annas</hi> had ſent him thither, though he had not mentioned it before. And for this cauſe alſo it is, that, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> is deſcribed, from his inveterate malice, as ſuppoſing that Chriſt was now brought before him, as is alſo ſet down in the Margent of our Bibles, out of ſome Original copies.</p>
                  <p>From this purpoſe <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord ſeem not to regard who wrong his children and people; yet he doth take notice of all of them, in due time to requite it; for, here, he takes notice who took Chriſt, both of <hi>the band,</hi> and their <hi>Captain,</hi> and of <hi>the officers of the Jews.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.6. 2. Chriſt being <hi>taken and bound,</hi> doth ſerve to teach; Partly, that every one of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, is by nature a bond-ſervant and ſlave to ſin, and liable to juſtice; for, he behooved to be <hi>bound,</hi> to expiate this ſlavery of his own. Partly, That by Chriſts being bound, ſuch as are given to him, have a right pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to be free from this ſlavery and bondage, whereof they are made partakers by coming to him; for, by his being <hi>bound,</hi> his own are freed. And they ought to be ſo much the more ſtrictly tyed in the bonds of love to him, and ſhould endeavour to enjoy their priviledge, and freedome from the ſlavery of ſin and terrours of the Law, and from a ſpirit of bondage. 3. As it is a ſad judgement on men, when they delight to ſee the bonds of Chriſt and his followers; So it may be their lot to be made a grateful ſpectacle to their enemies, and this Chriſt hath ſanctified in his own perſon; for, <hi>they led him away to Annas firſt,</hi> &amp;c Which was an evidence of his wicked diſpoſition, that he longed for ſuch a ſight; And is an inſtruction to Saints, informing them what their lot may be, ſince their Head and Lord was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from place to place, (even to <hi>Herod,</hi> as is marked by the reſt) to be a ſpectacle to his enemies. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. 4 Let Churches or perſons glory never ſo much in their priviledges; Yet all men are but liars, and the moſt eminent of them may degenerate ſo far, as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Ordinances of God, and become moſt bitter enemies unto Jeſus Chriſt and his truth; for, albeit the Church of the Jews had as fair promiſes as any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church; yet even there, the Ordinance of the Prieſthood is degenerate from the firſt inſtitution, and become an annual or <hi>yearly</hi> office; and the high Prieſt and his Father-in-law are they who take moſt pleaſure in beholding the ſufferings of Chriſt; Yea, who have greateſt hand in them. 5. Chriſt, in his ſuffering, met with all extremities and diſadvantages, that ſo he might ſanctifie ſuch lots unto his people, and might purchaſe to them (when he ſaw it good for them) more tender uſage in their ſufferings; for, therefore it is marked, <hi>v.</hi> 14. who this <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was, Not only to ſhew that the malicious deſigns and projects of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are not forgotten by God, however he ſpare them for a time; But that we might know, Chriſt had to do with an inveterate and bitter enemy. And from this it floweth, that ſometime his followers finde bitter uſage and extream violence, very eaſie and ſweet, and, (on the other hand) that ſometime they finde even enemies and perſecutors more milde and compaſſionate.

In theſe verſes is declared how <hi>Peter</hi> cometh to get into the place of trial: Namely, that (with another diſciple known to the high Prieſt) following his Maſter a far off, he is ſtopped at the door when the other got in, till that other diſciple, making uſe of his acquaintance in the houſe, removeth that ſtop. For clearing whereof, Conſider, 1. As for that <hi>other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple known to the high Prieſt</hi> (and, as appears by his dealing with the maid, to his family alſo.) Albeit it may ſeeme to have been <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, who uſeth thus to ſpeak of himſelfe in the third perſon, as <hi>chap.</hi> 20.2, 3, 4. and elſewhere: Yet there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to think that it was either he, or any other of the eleven. For it is not very probable that obſcure men, who for three years and an halfe had been diſciples to Chriſt, ſhould yet (any of them) be ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the high Prieſts houſe, who was ſo cruel an enemy to Jeſus. And therefore it ſhould ſeem he was one of Chriſts hidden diſciples (of whom <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.42.) who hearing of the buſineſſe, followed on with <hi>Peter</hi> (whom it ſeemeth he met by the way) and got eaſie acceſſe by reaſon of his acquaintance there. Conſider, 2. As for this practice of <hi>Peter;</hi> (or of <hi>John</hi> either, if ſo be that other was he) Albeit it was not unmeet Chriſt ſhould have ſome witneſſes there, to mark all that was done, and an hidden diſciple might act that part well enough: Yet ſeeing all the eleven Diſciples were diſmiſſed at that time, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and warned of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and the tryſting place aſſigned after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31, 32. and particularly, <hi>Peter</hi> being forewarned of his fall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33, 34. and that he could not follow his Maſter now, <hi>John</hi> 13.36. It may be concluded that he did raſhly, (however, it ſeem, affectionatly) thus to hazard in ſuch a place of trial: Eſpecially, having no other errand, (as is marked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.58.) but only to <hi>ſee the end,</hi> to applaud and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Maſter, if he eſcaped, and to ſhift for himſelfe, if it fell out otherwiſe. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The Lords people
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48148:190"/>
may draw themſelves under many ſelfe-created croſſes and trials; Not only in ſo far as by ſinne they procure they ſhould be inflicted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. or by their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unbelief do render their own condition grievous unto them, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did: But more eſpecially, when they run without a calling, and caſt themſelves upon tentations, in enſnaring places and company; for, thus did <hi>Peter</hi> here, when he <hi>followed Jeſus</hi> into the high Prieſts hall; Whatever zeal or affection ſeem to be in it. 2. We are bound to have charity, that even many who have much acquaintance with greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, may yet in their hearts be friends to Chriſt, though their faintneſs and reſervedneſs cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; for, there is <hi>another diſciple known to the high Prieſt,</hi> who <hi>went in</hi> (without interruption) <hi>with Jeſus into the palace of the high Prieſt.</hi> So there an <hi>Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> court, and a <hi>Rahab</hi> in <hi>Jericho.</hi> 3. Albeit Chriſt in his ſuffering ſeem to be deſerted of all, and his enemies may think they have driven his followers from him, and now he is in the power of them and their complices; Yet he wants not, even in ſuch ſocieties, ſome who are friends, and witneſſes of their injuſtice; for, here, one <hi>known to the high Prieſt,</hi> who <hi>went in with Jeſus,</hi> was a <hi>diſciple,</hi> and was a witneſſe to all their procedure. 4. When the Lords people are running upon ſnares, it may pleaſe him to lay an impediment by his providence in their way; whereof they ought to make uſe, to examine their way better; for, ſo much did the Lord call <hi>Peter</hi> unto, when in his providence the other got in, but he <hi>ſtood at the door without,</hi> the gate, it ſeems, being ſtrictly kept, ſo that no ſtrangers got in, poſſibly out of fear leſt Chriſt be reſcued. It is of general verity, that impediments laid in our way; cals us to examine it, though it prove not alwayes ill becauſe impeded, but the Lord thereby would only exerciſe our dependance and other graces. 5. As when the voyce of conſcience is often ſleighted, it may be ſtricken dumb, that it moleſt not the ſinner; So when providential diſpenſations, croſſing our way, are not regarded, the Lord may take away theſe impediments, and let men go on without difficulty, though little to their profit; for, he ſtanding without ſtill, the other diſciple interpoſeth and obtaineth acceſſe for him to the place where he fell in the ſnare. 6. It is the duty of friends to take heed leſt, in ſeeking too much to pleaſure their friends, they prove inſtruments of their deſtruction, at leaſt, of their real hurt; for, ſo this diſciple, by his kindneſſe and care of <hi>Peter,</hi> helped him into the ſnare.</p>

                  <p>The firſt branch of the firſt part of this Chapter, is here cloſed with an account of <hi>Peters</hi> carriage after this his ſlip: Namely, that he continued ſtill warming himſelfe among the reſt in a place ſo full of ſnares, which alſo did occaſion his repeated denials of his Maſter. He had been ſtanding there at his firſt denial, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.67. but having withdrawn a little into the porch, where he heard the cock crow the firſt time, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.68. he return: back again and continueth with them, till he is aſſaulted of new, as we find here, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as are carnal perſecutors of Chriſt, may yet be furniſhed with ſtore of outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, that ſo Saints may not doat upon theſe things which are ſo frequently caſt to dogs; for, <hi>the ſervants and officers</hi> (who had taken Chriſt) had <hi>a fire of coales, to warme themſelves, for it was cold.</hi> See <hi>Joh</hi> 18.18. 2. One given up to a tentation of fear, may have large more vexation and toſſing with ſhifting of trouble, then a reſolute ſufferer with enduring it; for, ſo appeares in <hi>Peters</hi> carriage, who ſometime ſhifts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from among the crowd (as is marked by the reſt) and again, fearing leſt that might render him ſuſpect, he cometh among them, and <hi>ſtands with them,</hi> either that he might be hid in the throng, or might bear out his denial with his confident carriage. 3. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of 2 childe of God may be ſtrangly deaded and laid by for a time, by a ſinne againſt light, and not become ſoon tender again; for, though he had denied his Maſter, and the cock had crowed once (as is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where recorded) to give him warning, yet he <hi>ſtood with them,</hi> and went not out to mourn. Thus was it with <hi>David</hi> in the matter of, <hi>Bethſhabe</hi> and <hi>Uriah:</hi> And in <hi>Peter</hi> it is eſpecially to be obſerved, that his care and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48148:191"/>
toſſing about his own preſervation, hindred his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do its duty, which teſtifieth that that care was a ſnare unto him. 4. The children of the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments and accomodations are, many time, ſo dear bought, that it were far better to want them, then to go out of Gods way to finde them; for, <hi>Peter ſtood and warmed himſelfe,</hi> but the high Prieſts fire was a ſnare to a diſciple, and he was forced to vomite up that morſal, when he left the fire, and went out and wept bitterly.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond branch of this part of the Chapter, <hi>John</hi> gives an account of a conflict betwixt Chriſt and the high Prieſt, (omitting ſeveral other paſſages record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſt) <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. and with one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24. In this verſe is recorded the high Prieſts examination of Chriſt, and putting him to give an account of his <hi>diſciples</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi> as ſuppoſing him guilty of ſedition and ſchiſme in gathering diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and of hereſie in his doctrine whereby he gathered them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt and his followers may expect no fair procedure of law from perſecutors, even when they ſeem to obſerve ſome forme of it; for, though it was the high Prieſts office to examine ſuch caſes, yet there is much informality here; Not only in that they had taken him before, and would have him now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer before an armed guard, and in that their minde was preoccupied not to let him go on any tearmes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.67, 68. But in that they have taken and arraigned him, before they have any articles of accuſation to lay to his charge, and to prove by witneſſes, (as is alſo clear from the reſt) putting it upon himſelfe to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and accuſe himſelf. 2. It is not unuſual for the beſt of doctrines and practices to paſſe up and down in the world under the moſt odious names and imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; So that we ſhould not take notice of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the names uſually given them; for, ſo is Chriſt here in his practice ſuppoſed guilty of ſedition and ſchiſme, in gathering diſciples and followers, and his doctrine inſinuate to be unſound, and ſuch as could not abide the light, and therefore had been taught in corners, as Chriſt in his anſwer underſtands his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Thus alſo was the Goſpel and preachers thereof eſteemed of, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.6. and 24.14. and 28.22. though yet upon clear information, theſe imputations did eaſily evaniſh, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.28, 31, 32. 3. It pleaſed Chriſt to underly the imputation of ſedition, ſchiſme, and hereſie, as a perturber both of Church and State; That ſo he might not only ſanctifie ſuch a lot to his followers, but might expiate our ſeditious revoltings, and rentings from God, and one from another, and that falſe doctrine and theſe corrupt principles which our firſt Parents hearkened unto, and all of us by nature do entertain; for, ſo much may be gathered from his being accuſed in the matter <hi>of his diſciples, and of his doctrine.</hi> 4. Whatever zeal to Religion and ſound doctrine perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of Chriſt and his followers do pretend, yet it is ſome other thing that pincheth them; And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, corrupt Church-men do oft-times make a great noiſe about Religion as wronged, when yet the thing that troubleth them moſt, is the decay of their own reputation among people: for, Therefore doth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, firſt, <hi>of his diſciples,</hi> and then, <hi>of his doctrine,</hi> as being indeed not ſo much troubled with the matter of his doctrine (had it been never ſo unſound, as it was indeed the truth of God proceeding from truth it ſelfe) as that thereby diſciples were made, and ſo the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him and his complices leſſened among the people.</p>

He gives a brief account of his way and manner of preaching, <hi>v.</hi> 20. That he had not (as the accuſation indirectly implyed) gone into corners with it, but had taught openly to the world, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in the Temple and Synagogues, where the Jewes were his ordinary hearers, and ſo had not carried himſelfe as if he durſt not avow his doctrine. 2. From this he gathereth an inference, <hi>v.</hi> 21. wherein he accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their illegal procedure, who would have him to accuſe himſelfe, and would not proceed legally in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining witneſſes in ſo publike a matter, to whom he appeals. For clearing this purpoſe, Conſider, 1. While Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I ſpake openly,</hi> and declines to have ſpoken any thing <hi>in ſecret,</hi> his meaning is not to condemne mens preaching of truth ſecretly, in a time of violent perſecution; Yea, and that private teaching and exhortation be joyned with publike preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. But his ſcope is only, in matter of fact, to ſhew what his practice had been, that ſo he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the high Prieſts proceeding. And withall, by this he would ſhew, that however men may preach in ſecret in ſome caſes, for the preſervation of their perſons, yet they ought not ſo to do, as deſiring to have truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, as if it were not juſtifiable, nor might be avowed in it ſelfe. Conſider, 2. This profeſſion of Chriſt, doth nothing contradict his practice elſewhere, in teaching the diſciples ſecretly, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.34. for he taught his diſciples no other thing, for kinde of doctrine, but what he taught publikely, only he expounded it to them. And withall, he did ſo, not that it might be concealed, but that they might proclaime it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.27. Conſider, 3. Chriſts refuſing to give an account of his doctrine, is no way a denying or diſavowing of his doctrine, but only a legal defence.

who are lying in wait to enſnare and ruine them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſt doth not anſwer concerning his diſciples, which was the firſt part of the high Prieſts interrogatory; We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reaſon to be, Not ſo much becauſe, poſſibly, he intended it, after he had anſwered firſt to the matter of his doctrine, but was impeded by the uncivil carriage of the high Prieſts ſervant, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Nor yet only becauſe he would not enſnare and betray them, by giving an account of them: But chiefly, to ſhew, that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being well conſidered, that other queſtion needed not be anſwered, nor would he be found ſeditious in gathering diſciples thereby; for, not only had he in his doctrine taught theſe whom he healed to go unto the Prieſts according to the law, and theſe who converſed with him, to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, But his doctrine being the doctrine of the Meſſiah, there could be no ſedition or ſchiſme, though all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould embrace him and it. And ſo it teacheth, That a mans doctrine and grounds would be firſt conſidered, before any effects or conſequents following thereupon, be judged. For albeit, ſometime, a man may have truth on his ſide, which yet is not of that importance, nor ſo relevant a ground, as to make an open ſchiſme and rent upon it; Yet where weighty matters of truth are held out by a man in his ſtation, his cauſe is ſufficient to ward off all imputations ariſing from odious-like conſequents fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon the publiſhing thereof. 2. Saints, in their ſufferings, ought to account of truth and their cauſe, as the precious treaſure, carefully to be owned and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it ſuffer nothing by them; Therefore, albeit Chriſt ſometime would not anſwer their calumnies and accuſations, partly, as being frivolous, and, partly, to teſtifie that being conſidered as our ſurety, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, there being nothing charged on him, but his people were guilty of it, or their ſins deſerved it: Yet here (as at other times alſo) he <hi>anſwered,</hi> to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that however he yielded his perſon, yet he would not yield his cauſe as unworthy to be owned. And hereby giveth his followers an example what to do in their ſufferings. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19, 20. 3. Such as have truth on their ſide, may ſpeak it boldly and freely, as that which may be avowed, and will bear them out who own it; And men ought thus to ſpeak it, as they have a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſpeak openly,</hi> or <hi>confidently,</hi> both <hi>to the world</hi> in general, and particularly, <hi>in the Synagogue and Temple, whither the Jewes alway reſort.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 4.29. 4. Whatever care ſhould be had that pearles be not caſt before ſwine; Yet the truth of God ought to be publiſhed by his ſervants indifferently to the world, in their ſtations, as being debtors to all, and not knowing upon whom the Lord may make their Miniſtry ſucceſſeful; and however it ſucceed, a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is to be left againſt the incorrigible; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſpake openly to the world,</hi> or to all, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently and freely, to whom he had a commiſſion. 5. It is a commendable practice of members of the viſible Church, to frequent the publike Ordinances and places appointed for that end; And herein, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of men who live in a degenerate and corrupt Church, may condemne the negligence of others; for, it is here ſuppoſed, that in this time, <hi>the Jews did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſort in the Synagogue,</hi> for their ordinary Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſervices, <hi>and in the Temple,</hi> where their more ſolemne and ceremonial wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſts preaching not only <hi>openly to the world,</hi> but more eſpecially, <hi>in the Synagogue, and in the Temple,</hi> where there were Jewes of ſeveral tempers, and many of them ſet to enſnare him, and jangle with him; May ſerve to teach, not only, That his love was great, who ſought them ſo earneſtly, who yet were about to crucifie him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. and, That the power accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his doctrine is ſuch, as there may be hopes of prevailing thereby, even among the moſt corrupt ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men. As he publiſheth his doctrine among his moſt cruel enemies, where (no doubt) he prevailed with ſome, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. But further, it teacheth, That truth muſt be preached, as men have a calling, where there are many diſadvantages, and ſtrange humours of people, to encounter; And, That faithful Miniſters muſt not alwayes expect ſuch auditories as they would deſire, for tractableneſſe and ſubjection: for, Chriſt, the Prince of Teachers, <hi>taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple.</hi> 7 Miniſters of the Goſpel, in their preaching thereof, ought to renounce the hidden things of diſhoneſty; Either, in conveighing lawful duties in a clandeſtine baſe way, which is apt to render them ſuſpected; Or, by their ſo ordering their way, as they may decline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or hatred, or may compaſſe ſome baſe by-ends; for, ſo much doth Chriſts example teach, who <hi>in ſecret ſaid nothing,</hi> as is before explained. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From <hi>v</hi> 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. A mans publike carriage (eſpecially if he be one whoſe carriage is, for moſt part, not our and known) being examined and found right, it is full of hazard, and evidenceth great want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſuſpect his integrity or his carriage in other things, unleſſe there be good ground for it. Therefore, Chriſt carrying himſelfe openly in his doctrine, he counts it very informal to judge him as a heretick or ſeditious perſon, unleſſe it could be inſtructed by his hearers. And herein men ſaile exceedingly, by their envy and ſecret whiſperings, of which ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. 2. A man being by the law of nature obliged to ſelfe-defence, and againſt ſelfe-murther; ought therefore not to accuſe himſelfe before a Judge; Therefore Chriſt declineth ſo to do, <hi>why askeſt thou me?</hi> 3. Whatever liberty men have to decline ſuch witneſſes as do profeſſe their malicious and partial diſpoſition, and that they will not make conſcience of lying, ſo they may condemne the innocent: Yet the carriage of Chriſts followers ſhould be ſuch, as they need not decline any witneſſes who will declare the truth: Therefore Chriſt appeals indifferently to his hearers, be who they will, if they would tell what he ſaid, <hi>Ask them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them.</hi> 4. It is the duty of hearers to be able to give an account of what they hear, as they are called to it; for, Chriſt ſuppoſeth this of them, <hi>Behold, they know what I ſaid,</hi> though few of many hearers attain to ſo much.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes is recorded Chriſts conflict with one of the high Prieſts officers, who ſmites Chriſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, and challengeth him for ſpeaking in ſuch a manner to the high Prieſt, <hi>v.</hi> 22. The reaſon whereof is not to be taken from this, that Chriſt appealing to his hearers, <hi>v.</hi> 21. (of which ſort theſe officers alſo had been, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.32, 46.) he, by this practice, will clear himſelfe of any reſpect to his doctrine. But the cauſe of it was his reſpect to the high Prieſt his Maſter; And he thus dealeth with Chriſt, becauſe he anſwered not reverently, as he conceived, and becauſe he carried himſelfe ſo confidently. Chriſt, in his anſwer, (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) doth taxe this way of procedure, urging, that if he had ſpoken wrong, the Court was now ſitting legally to examine him, and he might orderly accuſe and bear witneſſe, and not abuſe him: and if he had ſpoken right, it was a great injury ſo to uſe him, eſpecially before a Judicatory.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Corrupt Maſters have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily corrupt ſervants; and as ſometime ſervants may corrupt their Maſters, ſo it is as frequent that ſervants are corrupted by their Maſters, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.12, for, here, the <hi>officers</hi> are ſuch as their Maſter was. 2. Mens greatneſſe (though accompanied with no goodneſſe) doth ordinarily ſo dazzle the eyes of others, that they think it intolerable any ſhould not doat on them as themſelves do, were their courſes never ſo evil; for, that he was <hi>the high Prieſt,</hi> is enough to make this officer take it ill that Chriſt did not (as he thought) give more reverence to him, and that although he was unworthy and nothing like that office, and was even now perſecuting Chriſt. 3. Great ones, and their adherents, do think their authority contemned, if they be not abſolutely humoured and get all their will, though to the prejudice and quitting of truth; for, albeit Chriſt, in his anſwer, do only taxe their illegal proceeding, and adhereth to truth and the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in a legal way; Yet this officer cannot endure he ſhould thus ſtand to his point, and not yield to the high Prieſt: And therefore with a buffet enquireth, <hi>anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo?</hi> 4. Chriſt did endure buffeting and contemptible uſage, even from enferiour ſervants, giving his check to the nippers; to teſtifie that ſhame and reproachful uſage was our due; yea, even to be buffeted with Satans Meſſengers; and that ſuch as flee to him, have the curſe of ſuch a lot removed, and it ſanctified unto them; for, to teach and purchaſe this, was our ſurety <hi>ſtricken with the palm of this officers hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. However men may think to drive Chriſt and his followers from truth and duty by buffeting, yet that will not prevail, ſo long as they cannot be convinced that God is againſt them; which would prevail with a conſcience that otherwiſe will not be beaten from truth: Therefore, Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus abuſed, inſiſts mainly on this, <hi>if he had ſpoken evil or well,</hi> as the thing to be diſcuſſed, before he could alter his way. 2. Albeit Chriſt require that his people reſiſt not evil, yet his meaning is only to binde up their hands from private revenge, and not to ſhut their mouthes from complaining to Authority; for, here his own practice expounds that precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.39. in that, though he will not avenge himſelf; yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the injurie, before their Judicatory, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the man, not to ſtrike him illegally, but to <hi>bear witneſſe of the evil.</hi> 3. There is no cauſe that cometh before men, but (for the moſt part) it is like to have fairer juſtice then Chriſts cauſe, all men being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and abſurd here, who have not faith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. for, ſo much doth Chriſts arguing import, where, by an argument pinching on all hands, he intimates he got foule play, whether he had <hi>ſpoken evil or well.</hi> 4. Chriſt in his own perſon hath underlien unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able uſage, that he might expiate our deſert hereof, and our abſurd walking contrary to God; and might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie ſuch a lot to his followers, and aſſure them that he (having drunk this cup for them) will ſee them righted and get faire play, one way or other; for, ſo much may we gather for our uſe, from this uſage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he complains.</p>

                  <p>Before that <hi>John</hi> proceed to the laſt branch of this part of the Chapter, he doth here ſubjoyn how <hi>Annas</hi> (to whom Chriſt was ſent, <hi>v.</hi> 13.) had ſent him bound to <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> Not (as hath been cleared on <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14.) as if the things formerly recorded had been acted upon him before he was brought thither; But only, by way of concluſion to the former purpoſe. and by way of tranſition to what followeth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that Chriſt before this had been brought to the High Prieſts hall, where he was examined and injured by the High Prieſts ſervant, and where <hi>Peter</hi> denied him, though he had not mentioned his bringing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before. From the purpoſe in this verſe. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It pleaſed the Father to expoſe his Son Chriſt to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his enemies, who ſhewed him no mercy, but the uttermoſt of their rage; that ſo he might purchaſe a better lot for his people: for, therefore it is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as he came bound to <hi>Annas, v.</hi> 12, 13. ſo he doth not releaſe him, but <hi>ſent him bound to Caiaphas</hi> his mortal enemy. 2. God will not only mark what cruelty people exerciſe againſt Chriſt and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves, but how they contribute to, and are inſtrumental in their ill uſage from others; Therefore it is marked, to the perpetual infamy of <hi>Annas,</hi> that when he had inſulted a while over Chriſt, he <hi>ſent him bound to Caiaphas,</hi> where he might be yet more cruelly handled. 3. It pleaſed our Lord in his ſufferings, to condeſcend to come bound as a delinquent before an High Prieſt, that ſo he might teach his people what delinquents they were before the Tribunal of God, and

                  <p>Followeth in theſe verſes, the third branch of this part of the chapter, wherein <hi>Peters</hi> ſecond and third denial of his Maſter are recorded. <hi>John</hi> doth in brief declare, that <hi>Peter,</hi> after his firſt denial, ſtaying ſtill in the crowd, and warming himſelf, (as is alſo former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked, <hi>v.</hi> 18.) was the ſecond time aſſaulted and challenged as one of Chriſts diſciples, and doth againe deny it: And that after a while, (as is marked, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.59.) he is the third time aſſaulted by one who had intereſt in the man whom <hi>Peter</hi> had hurt, and who had ſeen him in the garden with Chriſt. But he perſiſts in his denial, till the cock crew the ſecond time, which being accompanied with Chriſts looking on him, and his remembring what Chriſt had foretold, is a mean to draw him to repentance, as is marked by the reſt. For clearing this purpoſe, Conſider, 1. Whereas in his ſecond aſſault, as is ſaid in general, that <hi>they</hi> (to wit, who were preſent) <hi>ſaid to him, &amp;c.</hi> and yet two of the reſt aſſert this aſſault to have been by a maid, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.69. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.71. and another, that it was by a ſervant, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.58. This difficulty may be thus reconciled, that a maid and a ſervant aſſaulting him, and he ſeeming to neglect them, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or many of them, do charge him with it, which puts him on the ſnare of an open denial. 2. As for the third aſſault, the differences betwixt the Evangeliſts may be thus reconciled, That being challenged to be one of Chriſts followers, as being a Galilean, whoſe ſpeech bewrayed him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.73. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.70. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.59. this ſervant which ſaw him in the garden, (and belike, ſaw him alſo cut off his kinſmans eare) confirmeth the challenge: All which importunity, and poſſibly ſome intimation that it was known what he had done in the garden, precipitates him upon a third denial. 3. As for the manner of his denial, there is no great difficulty; for, it is the ſame thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that he is ſaid to deny by all of them, to wit, that he was Chriſts diſciple, or with him. Only while the reſt obſerve that he denied to have known Chriſt, or to underſtand of what they ſpake when they challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, it points out to what an abſurdity his feare drave him, in that he profeſſeth his ignorance of him, of whoſe fame and report almoſt none in the land were ignorant. And his ſwearing and curſing, recorded by them to have accompanied his denial, doth further point out what the violence of the tentation was, and what ſtuffe may lurk in the boſome of Saints, ready to break out when there is a tentation.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord takes ſtrict and conſtant notice of mens deportment and walking upon ſnares, however they little heed it themſelves; and the longer they do ſo, he is the more offended: Therefore it is yet again remarked, that all this while, <hi>Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> yet <hi>ſtood</hi> and <hi>warmed himſelf</hi> in that place, among ſuch company. 2. Such as do caſt themſelves in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable company, and continue among them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of their accommodations, do not readily eſcape without a foule trial and ſlip, and that moe then one; for, <hi>Peter ſtanding and warming himſelf,</hi> his carriage caſts him upon the ſnare of a new denial. 3. Men are ſo much the nearer a fall, as they continue among ſnares and tentations, when the Lord is eminently calling them to their duty, and to mourn for their former fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and ſo their carriage is nothing anſwerable to what their condition, or the Lords diſpenſations calls them aloud unto; for, this addeth to his guilt, and ripens him for a new aſſault and fall, that <hi>he ſtood and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf,</hi> when he ſhould have been mourning for his former denial. 4. As Satan is alwayes tempting beleevers, as he hath opportunity; ſo eſpecially, when he hath gained any ground upon them, he is an eager purſuer of them by his fitted means and inſtruments, and their falling in any degree, is but a preludie to greater tentations; for, Satan having prevailed by the voice of a weak damoſel, doth now the ſecond time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, by a maid, a ſervant, and many together; <hi>They ſaid therefore unto him, Art thou not alſo one of his diſciples?</hi> 5. As Satan is ready to tempt and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault ſliding diſciples; ſo they being once entred in a courſe of defection, are ready to perſiſt and go yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong, eſpecially when they are not ſenſible of their former failings; for, <hi>he</hi> again <hi>denied it, and ſaid, I am not,</hi> and that with an oath, as is recorded by the reſt. 6. It is the great ſin of Chriſts diſciples to deny their Maſter, or themſelves to be his diſciples and followers; for, this was <hi>Peters</hi> fault, <hi>He ſaid, I am not one of his diſciples.</hi> And albeit it was his eminent ſlip to renounce his Maſter by an avowed denial; yet others have need to look to it, who though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him, yet their practice doth refute their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. And namely, when they practiſe not ſuch duties as are required of diſciples: ſuch as, hearing and abiding in his Word, <hi>John</hi> 10.27. and 8.31. ſelf-denial and bearing of his croſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. mortification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. walking after his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. meekneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. mutual love, <hi>John</hi> 13.35, and ſeveral other duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Satan is inceſſant in purſuing, ſo he knoweth how to fit tentations to every mans humour, that they may take; Therefore, <hi>Peter</hi> being all this while poſſeſſed with fear, he hounds out <hi>his kinſman, whoſe eare Peter cut off,</hi> (whereof, belike, he had ſome intimation) and one who <hi>ſaw him in the garden,</hi> that theſe conſiderations working yet more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fear, might drive him to a new and more groſſe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48148:193"/>
denial. 2. As it is Satans element to ſin and draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to multiply ſin after ſin; ſo Saints, eſpecially, may expect that when they ſlip, they will be moſt, of any, inceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntly purſued, to adde ſin after ſin. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satans delight to engage them eſpecially in ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and by the throng of tentations, to keep them from recovering their feet; Therefore doth he thus purſue <hi>Peter</hi> the third time. 3. It is the duty of the Lords people, when they are tempted, to conſider what impediments the Lord layeth in the courſe of their ſinning, that ſo they may be aſhamed to go on; And it is their great ſin, when they do otherwiſe; for, whatever was Satans aime in chooſing this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to aſſault him the third time; yet the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by would ſhame him from his denial, by bringing in ſo clear evidences againſt him that he was a diſciple, which he could not ſhift without much impudence, and without open wronging of his Maſter as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be owned, and that before them who certainly knew he had been one of his followers. All which did contribute to make his ſin of denial the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 4. Saints weakneſſe is ſuch, as being aſſaulted, they may fall again and again in the ſame ſin; as here <hi>Peters</hi> threefold denial teacheth us, <hi>Peter then denied again.</hi> It is, indeed, more grievous, when men fall often again into the ſame ſin, even after they have repented for their former falling into it, (though the Scripture declareth not that to be inconſiſtent with the ſtate of grace in a perſon) but it may be more frequently inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Saints, to relapſe often while they are ſtill kept going under the power of tentations, without getting liberty to draw their breath, or recollect themſelves; which was <hi>Peters</hi> caſe here, and pleads for more pity. 5. A gap being once made in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by ſin, it will eaſily grow wider, and one ſin will prove a needle to draw in the thread of another ſin; as here <hi>Peters</hi> experience doth witneſſe, who by one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial is drawn to another, and who from ſimple denial, proceeds to denial with an oath, and then with curſing, as the reſt obſerve. 6. When Saints begin to ſlip, and do not make conſcience of repentance for it, God may let their defection riſe to a very great height, till they ſee cauſe to abhorre themſelves indeed; for, ſo much alſo doth this experience teach. He, not heeding, nor being affected with his firſt denial, the Lord gives him up to mee denials, and that with ſwearing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; that ſo his conſcience may be alarm'd with the groſſeneſſe of his way. And indeed, ſolid repentance in a backſliding way is ſeldome attained, till the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come to ſome height of groſſeneſſe. 7. Whatever be mens conceit of themſelves, yet the event will clear that Chriſts verdict concerning mans frailty, is true, and that their preſumption is a liar; for, here, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the cock crew,</hi> to witneſſe, that before this time prefixed by Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> had denied him thrice, according to his prediction, <hi>John</hi> 13.38. 8. Albeit the Lord ſuffer his own to ſlip through tentation, that he may correct their proud conceit of themſelves, and teach them to abide more in him; yet he will not utterly loſe, but will recover them; for, <hi>the cock crew;</hi> to put <hi>Peter</hi> in minde of what paſt betwixt Chriſt and him: which being accompanied with other meanes, draws him to repentance, as is marked by the reſt. 9. The ſame means which men have had, and yet have profited nothing by them, may yet be much uſeful when God commands a bleſſing; for, albeit <hi>Peter</hi> was alarm'd by the cocks crowing firſt, after his firſt fall, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.68. yet he never remembreth Chriſts words, but goeth on, and the ſame mean, with Chriſts look, is bleſſed. 10. The Lord is, oft-times, in mercy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to recover his people by very ſpeedy repentance, after their trial for diſcovering of their weakneſſe, is over; And particularly, ſuch as through violence of tentations are driven upon ſin, do readily ſooner recover by repentance, then they who upon reſolution, and with deliberation engage in a courſe of ſin; for, <hi>Peter</hi> being under a violent tentation in this his ſinning, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the cock crew,</hi> to give him warning to repent, which accordingly ſucceeds.</p>

It may be taken up in foure branches. In the firſt whereof (in this verſe) is recorded how they led Jeſus unto the <hi>hall of judgement,</hi> (or the place where the Romane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours uſed to ſit in judgement) to have him ſentenced and condemned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and executed accordingly. Before all which, we are to conceive, (as is marked by the reſt) that the chief Prieſts and their Councel, had (beſide their examination of himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 19.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined falſe witneſſes againſt him, and adjured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to declare what he was; and upon his confeſſion condemned him of blaſphemy, and adjudged him to be worthy of death. And then, with all ſpeed they bring him to the Roman Governour, as is here marked. Unto which <hi>John</hi> ſubjoyneth, that they themſelves would not enter into the judgement hall, leſt being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed they ſhould be kept from the Paſſeover, which they did not eat till this day, as hath been cleared on <hi>chap.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It may ſhame the Lords people in their negligence in going about his ſervice, to ſee the activity of wicked men in their ill courſes, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their oppoſition to Chriſt; for, here, having been at it all night, they do not yet weary, but <hi>led him</hi> away, <hi>and it was early,</hi> and they go themſelves, and do not ſend officers only. 2. It pleaſed the Lord ſo to order, as Chriſt ſhould he brought before a pagan Judge, and be by him condemned; one reaſon whereof is given, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. which I remit to its proper place, And do adde, 1. Chriſt would not be ſlain tumultuouſly, as the Jewes cut off <hi>Steven, Acts</hi> 7. but would be judicially condemned, that ſo ſin might be condemned in the fleſh, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.3. and he might fully ſatisfie for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and abide a full proceſſe in Law. 2. By this lot he would expiate our being under the dominion of forreign powers of ſin; Satan, and the kingdome of darkneſſe. 3. Chriſt by getting his innocency aſſerted
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48148:193"/>
by <hi>Pilate,</hi> (which the Jewes would never grant) and yet being by him condemned, would have it cleared, that he ſuffered not for himſelf, but for others. 4. By this means both Jewes and Gentiles had an hand in his death, that both might have an occaſion to look to him whom they had pierced, to excite them to repentance and mourning. 5. Hereby alſo he hath ſanctified unto his people their being brought before judgement-ſeats, (even of unfriends or ſtrangers to Religion) for his ſake: All theſe conſiderations may be read in this, that <hi>they led Jeſus from Gaiaphas, unto the hall of judgement. Doct.</hi> 3. Men may pretend to very much zeal in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performances of Religion, who yet are but naughty, yea, and cruel bloody perſecutors; for, ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in theſe here; <hi>They themſelves went not into the judgment-hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſſeover.</hi> It is not needful to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether it was a Tradition of their own, or a determination by God, that entring into the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-hall ſhould defile them, that they might not eat the Paſſeover; or whether they apprehended pollution, from ſomewhat they might meet with there, rather then from entring ſimply to the place; But this is clear in it, that they pretend to reſpect the Paſſeover, and are careful to avoid pollution; when yet they are ſeeking the life of the Lord of glory.

It may be taken up in a twofold propoſition of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and their anſwer thereunto. In the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (in theſe verſes) <hi>Pilate</hi> will not ſtand on termes with them, but goeth out unto them, and deſireth they would produce an accuſation againſt Chriſt, upon which he might formally and legally proceed, <hi>v.</hi> 29. The Jewes in anſwering, ſuſpecting that probation might ſucceed but ill, as it had before themſelves, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.55. — 59. do interpoſe their own credit and reputation with <hi>Pilate,</hi> in ſtead of an accuſation, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly taking it as an affront that he ſhould require an accuſation from them, or think that ſuch men as they, would bring any before him to be condemned, but an evil-doer, <hi>v.</hi> 30. From <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of Rulers, not only to do juſtice, but to be ready to do it timouſly, and with as great expedition as may be: for, this is commendable in <hi>Pilate,</hi> that though <hi>it was early,</hi> when they came, <hi>v.</hi> 28. yet he is ready to hear them. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.13. 2. It is alſo commendable in men of power and eminency, not to ſtand on termes with their inferiours, nor carp at their ſcruples and weakneſſes; but to paſſe over all theſe, and do them juſtice; for, this is alſo commendable in him, that when they ſcruple to enter into <hi>the judgement-hall, v.</hi> 28. he ſtands not on that, but <hi>went out to them,</hi> far contrary to the practice of many great ones, who, if their inferiours croſſe any of their humours, will be ſure to give them a meeting when they come in their hands. See <hi>Job</hi> 31.13, 14. 3. It is agreeable to juſtice, that no man be condemned without an accuſation produced and proven againſt him, and that men in power do not <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a man to death</hi> (as the words wil read, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.16.) nor make uſe of their Authority to pleaſure friends, or ſatisfie their own luſts, ſeeing judgement is not theirs, but the Lords; Therefore, <hi>Pilate,</hi> an heathen, is clear to follow this order, <hi>What accuſation bring you againſt this man?</hi> From <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Jewes could lay nothing to Chriſts charge before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> but either that he was againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which was a lie, or that he called himſelf the Son of God, which was indeed a truth; yet here he is preſented <hi>as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour,</hi> or a notorious and noxious evil-doer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would, partly, teach, what we indeed were in whoſe room he ſtood: even ſuch notorious delinquents, unworthy to live on the earth: And partly, he would ſanctifie unto his people their lying under unjuſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; calumnies, which he eſſayed, being traduced as an enemie to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and would ſanctifie unto them their living in times, wherein cleareſt truthes are perſecuted under odious names; as his calling himſelf the Son of God was accounted blaſphemy. 2. Men may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laviſh in blaſting the reputation of others, who yet would be loath to be ſo dealt with by others; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, they who make an idol of their own credit, do regard leaſt the credit of others; for, they ſtand not to traduce Chriſt <hi>as a malefactour,</hi> who yet tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is an old trick of corrupt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and perſecutors, to abuſe civil powers, and to make uſe of any reſpect they have from them, to give them bad impreſſions of the godly, and ſet them on edge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; as here theſe corrupt rulers do make uſe of any reſpect <hi>Pilate</hi> had to them, to condemn Chriſt on their word; <hi>If he were not a malefactour, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</hi> 4. Men ought to take heed how they employ any credit God hath given them with men, as being a talent for the uſe whereof they will be called to an account; And it is an evidence that mens credit, authority, or parts, are plagued to them, when they hang at their wrong ſide, and they labour to turn men againſt Chriſt and his truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as they are againſt him; as here, notice is taken that they employed their credit in this wicked way.

                     <hi>Pilate,</hi> in his ſecond propoſition, remits the trial and cenſure of Chriſt to themſelves, to be gone about according to their law. But they, in their anſwer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that they had power to put any man to death, <hi>v.</hi> 31. in which a ſpecial providence is remarked, <hi>v</hi> 32. For clearing of this propoſition and anſwer, and the whole purpoſe, Conſider, That it is aſſerted by many, that the Jewes being now under the power of the Romans, though they had not power to inflict capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for crimes condemned alſo by the Roman Lawes; yet they had power not only to judge of leſſer faults, and to inflict puniſhments which were not unto death, but might alſo put men to death for blaſphemy againſt God and their own Law, whereof they judge Chriſt to be guilty. Therefore they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this ſpeech of the Jewes, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</hi> as importing, not that they might not do it at all, nor yet only that they would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Pilate,</hi> by renouncing their power, that they might engage him for them; But that they might not do it at that time, in regard of the holineſſe of the feaſt, for which cauſe alſo it ſeems that <hi>Herod</hi> delayed the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed execution of <hi>Peter,</hi> till after <hi>Eaſter, Acts</hi> 12.4. And they ſtrengthen this aſſertion from this conſideration, That ſuppoſe this power had been taken from them, yet in this caſe they could not object want of power or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unleſſe it had been becauſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the time, ſeeing <hi>Pilate</hi> had granted them liberty to judge him. But whatever be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this purpoſe, yet upon accurate ſearch of the Jewiſh Records, and other paſſages, it will be found, That they had indeed power of leſſer cenſures, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as may be gathered from <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. That they had alſo power in capital crimes againſt their own Religion, to examine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of the offence, and to determine what it deſerved, as they did in Chriſts caſe, <hi>John</hi> 19.7. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65, 66. and in doing whereof in the caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> they complain that they were interrupted by <hi>Lyſias, Acts</hi> 24.5, 6, 7. Neither is it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied alſo, that in their practice they ſomewhat went further, and in a tumultuous way did cut off capital offenders, (as they conceived them to be) in the matter of their Religion, without any legal proceſſe, or owning of the Roman Governour. But as for matter of right or liberty granted then by the Romans, they had no power at all to put any to death, till he were brought before the Governour, who was to take cognition of the cauſe, and to give out ſentence, and ſee it executed. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth all along here, in their bringing Chriſt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> after they had condemned him, in their very clear profeſſion of the want of power in this place, and in their proſecuting Chriſt inceſſantly before <hi>Pilates</hi> judgement ſeat, till he pronounced ſentence againſt him. We do not finde <hi>Pilate</hi> in the firſt entring of this proceſſe, give any hint of any ſuch power; nor is it to be doubted, but if they had any ſuch power, or had they looked upon <hi>Pilates</hi> ſpeech, as giving them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put him to death themſelves, they would greedily have embraced it, rather then put the matter in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, wherein they think themſelves ſo much concerned; eſpecially now when they finde <hi>Pilate</hi> like to ſtand ſo much on points with them; to ſay nothing that they were very tender in the matter of their liberty and power, and therefore would not willingly quit any right they had, or ſlight any liberty granted them. And if they who did perſecute Chriſt to death in the time of the feaſt, could not ſentence him at that time, yet (no doubt) on the former conſiderations, they would have kept him till the feaſt was over, for which they might have a guard of <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, as well as they had one for apprehending him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being conſidered, I take the ſcope and meaning of theſe verſes to be this, That <hi>Pilate;</hi> partly, having no will to meddle with Chriſt, whom he knew to be delivered to him for envy, and partly, being irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate by their preſumptuous and illegal anſwer to his propoſition, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. doth remit the matter back to themſelves, that if they judged him worthy only of ſome leſſer puniſhment, they might inflict the ſame according to the liberty yet continued with them: Or if they meant that he deſerved more, even death, when they called him <hi>a malefactour,</hi> he, (in a bitter taunt) declares that if that were their way according to their laws and Religion, to condemne a man upon truſt, and put him to death without an accuſation and formal proceſſe, he he would let them do on; But as for him, if he knew not the crime to cognoſce upon it, he would never be their executioner to pronounce ſentence and execute it, ſuch procedure being no wayes agreeable to the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtome, <hi>Act.</hi> 25.16. And ſo his ſpeech is rather a ſharp reflection upon them and their laws, then any permiſſion to them to execute any ſuch power. The Jewes, in their reply, declare that they had no power at all to put any man to death, and therefore had brought him to him. Whereby they both intimate that they thought that he deſerved more then they had power to inflict, and withal, they would pacifie <hi>Pilate,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his power, and declaring how they were content he ſhould exerce it among them. But in all this <hi>John</hi> obſerveth a providence of God, Not that the Jewes employed not the power which they had, or was now permitted to them, to put him to death. Nor yet only that they did it not tumultuouſly; But that they had no ſuch power at all; that ſo he might (according to his own prediction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32.) die under a Pagan Ruler, and might dye a <hi>Roman</hi> death and be crucified, which was more ſignificant then ſtoning, the ordinary death inflicted by the Jewes for blaſphemy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.16. which was the crime they falſly charged on Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65, 66. and would have ſtoned him for it before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33.</p>
                  <p>From theſe verſes thus cleared. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even Pagans may be more clear and juſt in their proceedings with Chriſt and his followers, then corrupt men in the Church, who have abuſed the offer of much grace; for, ſo doth appear here in <hi>Pilate</hi> and theſe Rulers of the Jewes; He doth not ſuppoſe Chriſt to be guilty of ſo much as they intend, nor is he ſo forward and informal as they are. 2. It is the great ſin of many men, that having no true piety, they will yet pretend to much of it; Whereby, and by their unanſwerable walking, they expoſe Religion to reproach, and render it deteſtable, even to Pagans: for, their preſumptuous commending of themſelves, to commend an injuſt procedure againſt

It is no ſtrange thing to ſee many idols of men ſtoop and give place to greater idols, coming in competition therewith; And, particularly, malice againſt Chriſt, his truth and followers, is ordinarily ſo violent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, that they will renounce their credit and pack up injuries very grievous to them, to get that ſatisfied: for this ſpeech, <hi>it is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</hi> is not only an ingenuous acknowledgement, that they had no power to deal with Chriſt as they thought he deſerved, but points out alſo, how they ſtartle not at this check given them, but inſinuate with him, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcing in their want of power (which yet was the thing they moſt affected) that ſo they might get him on their ſide, to condemne Chriſt. 5. The Lord hath a ſupreme hand and providence in the leaſt things which concerne Chriſt and his followers, and eſpecially in their ſufferings; for, that they want power, and he is left in <hi>Pilates</hi> hand, there was a providence in it, <hi>That the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled,</hi> &amp;c. 6. In this way of Chriſts dying under a ſtranger, and by crucifying, omitting what hath been ſaid on <hi>v.</hi> 28. and may be further ſpoken of his being crucified, in its proper place. Theſe paſſages of providence come to be obſerved. 1. That Chriſt is a faithful keeper of his word, and will not faile to ſee that performed which he ſpeaks therein; for, ſo appeareth in the firſt place; all theſe things were, <hi>that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled,</hi> and he might be found true in his predictions. 2. That Chriſt is the true Meſſiah, as being ſent into the world, when now the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. for, he foretold this death, and his delivering to the Gentiles to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, when the Jewes wanted power, as here they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this might contribute to the confirmation of this great truth. 3. Chriſt would be put to a moſt curſed, ignominious and painful death, that he might teſtifie his love to his own, and fully ſatisfie for them, and might lead them to inherit a bleſſing; for, all theſe concurred in this death; A more eaſie way of it being long ago pronounced accurſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. he would chooſe the moſt accurſed kinde of it, which withall was moſt ignominious and painfull. 4. Chriſt alſo by his poſture in this death, being lifted up with his armes ſtretched out upon the croſſe, would invite all his people to look and come to him, who ſtands with open armes ready to receive them, and make them partakers of his purchaſe.</p>

It may be taken up in three diſcourſes betwixt him and Chriſt: In the firſt whereof (in theſe verſes) <hi>Pilate</hi> enquireth if he was the King of the Jewes, and would grant that crime whereof they accuſed him; Chriſt deſires, in the firſt place, before he anſwer, whence that accuſation might flow, whither from his own apprehenſion, or from the Jewes: Whereby he would put <hi>Pilate</hi> to it, to conſider, either his own ſimplicity, if he himſelfe did ſuſpect him to be a King, ſuch a one as he dreamt of, when yet he ſaw nothing in him like ſuch a ſtate; or, his levity and credulity, if he did receive ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable report and delation from others; or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, if to pleaſe malicious delators and accuſers, he intended that proceſs againſt him <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a plague upon the children of men, that all of them by nature have ſtill ſomewhat to make them jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of Chriſt, and afraid of him and his company; for, as the Phariſees feared the blaſting of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him, and others are afraid that he will not give liberty to their luſts, ſo <hi>Pilate</hi> hath his own prejudice, in that he is accuſed to be <hi>the King of the Jewes.</hi> Happy are they who are delivered from prejudices at him. 2. It is, in particular, the great prejudice of Rulers and great men againſt Chriſt, that they apprehend that his Kingdome and power in his Church is prejudicial to their authority and power in the earth; for, that is the thing <hi>Pilate</hi> fears, when he enquires, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jewes?</hi> 3. It is exceeding reproachful either lightly to take up, or lightly to receive and hearken unto calumnies and reproaches, caſt upon men, or yet to gratifie theſe who are known to purſue the innocent maliciouſly; for, ſo much doth Chriſts queſtions to <hi>Pilate</hi> point at. 4. Men ought not to be born with, in their dallying with conſcience and juſtice, eſpecially in matters which concerne God and his truth, but ſhould be put to it, either altogether to diſclaime conſcience, and equity, or elſe to walk according to the rules thereof; for, ſo much alſo do Chriſts queſtions drive <hi>Pilate</hi> unto, that he would not dally in this proceſſe, if in his conſcience he knew it but frivolous and invented by malice.</p>

declines being the author of this accuſation, as being no Jew, nor acquaint with their contraverſies, nor caring for their Religion, or the King they expected; And fathers this whole buſineſs on the Jewes; Chriſts own countrey-men, and their Church-Rulers, withal deſiring to know what he had done which might ſo incenſe them againſt him, <hi>v.</hi> 35. Chriſt, having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the man, doth now come expreſſely to anſwer to the accuſation concerning his Kingdome, and ſpeaks ſo much of it, negatively, as might ſatisfie <hi>Pilate;</hi> that it might well enough conſiſt with the ſafety of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſtate: Therefore he ſheweth that his Kingdome was not a worldly Kingdome, and for proofe thereof, he inſtanceth how far he was from aſpiring to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by force of armes, in that he would not ſo much as permit his ſervants to fight in his defence, as they offered to do, when the Jewes came to take him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. <hi>Pilates</hi> commotion, evidenced in his reply, <hi>Am I a Jew?</hi> did not only flow from his reſpect to his credit, which he could not ſuffer that Chriſt ſhould touch upon, how juſtly ſoever; but alſo that his natural conſcience was touched, and that he is not willing Chriſt ſhould put his conſcience to it, ſeeing he could not follow it, and yet keep his politick ſmooth way. It teacheth, That they who not only are ſinfully tender of their credit, but they to whom a conſcience (what they have of it) is a vexation, and a croſſe to their deſignes, will readily meet with many vexations by reaſon thereof, and in end make ſhipwrack of it; As it fared with <hi>Pilate,</hi> who is here, irritate, knowing that Chriſt touched him in the quick, and afterward giveth up himſelfe, to go over the belly of his conſcience. 2. Even moral civility in men will account it as great a reproach as may be, and a matter of ſhame, to be the author and inventer of calumnies and reproaches againſt others; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> declines this, and faſtens it upon the Jewes, <hi>thine own nation, and the chief Prieſts have delivered thee unto me.</hi> 3. Such is the iniquitie and corruption of time, that hardly ſhall the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt aſperſion be caſt on any, but it will leave ſome impreſſion of guilt, at leaſt with ſome; Therefore, albeit <hi>Pilate</hi> knew the Jewes accuſation to be frivolous, and of envy, yet it gives him occaſion to ſuſpect ſome quarrel, which cauſeth to enquire, <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi> 4. Not only hath Chriſt, as <hi>God,</hi> an univerſal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of power and providence, even over the higheſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. But, as Mediatour, he hath a donative Kingdome in and over his Church, to the preſervation and propagation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his Kingdome of power is ſubſervient, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. for, ſo is here imported, that even in his ſtate of exinanition, he hath a Kingdome, <hi>my Kingdome.</hi> 5. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee truth ſo miſrepreſented as may ſtumble many, which yet being heard and cleared, will offend none; for, whereas this truth, that he is a King, was ſo repreſented as might offend <hi>Pilate,</hi> Chriſt lets him ſee that this needed not at all ſtumble him. 6. Albeit Chriſts Kingdome be in the world, yet it is not of the world; Not only in reſpect of the ſubjects, who ought not to be of the world, but chiefly, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to worldly Kingdomes; The benefits thereof not being earthly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. it being managed in a ſpiritual way, and with ſpiritual weapons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. and coming without external pomp and obſervation, like unto the Kingdomes of the world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20, 21. for, ſo much is imported in this aſſertion, <hi>my Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> whereby he removeth all cauſe of fear in <hi>Pilate.</hi> 7. It is the property of Chriſts ſubjects and ſervants, to be affectionate to their Lord and Maſter, and to be ready to do whatſoever is lawful for the good of his Kingdome; for, ſo is imported in that <hi>his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants would fight,</hi> if it had been warrantable. And hereof all made offer, and <hi>Peter</hi> gave a raſh proofe, as we heard on <hi>v.</hi> 10. 8. It is an evidence that Chriſts Kingdome is ſpiritual, that it is carried on not by force of armes, as worldly Kingdomes are, but by ſpiritual means; Therefore, doth Chriſt confirme his aſſertion (not by Scripture, which <hi>Pilate</hi> knew not, but) by that known inſtance, <hi>If my Kingdome were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Jewes.</hi> Whereas private men aſpiring to a worldly Kingdome, do uſe violence and force of armes, he had prohibited his diſciples to fight in his defence in the Garden. This is not to be underſtood, as if Chriſt diſallowed that they to whom he hath given the ſword, ſhould defend his Kingdome therewith; for, if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, even as Magiſtrates, ſhould be nurſing Parents to the Church, and ought to kiſſe the Son, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do record, then certainly they may and ſhould employ their power as Magiſtrates, for removing of Idolatry, and ſetting up the true worſhip of God, and for defending thereof againſt violence. But Chriſts purpoſe and ſcope in this may be fully taken up in theſe. 1. Chriſt in his preſent ſtate of humiliation, came into the world, not to get viſible powers on his ſide, but to abaſe himſelfe and ſuffer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. And to this the words in the text relate, while it is ſaid, they did not fight, <hi>that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jewes.</hi> But in his ſtate of exaltation, he hath given, and will give more ample proofes of his power, even in cruſhing Kings and Potentates, who oppoſe him and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9, 10, 12. and 110.5, 6. (which is ſometime brought to paſſe by warre) and in employing the Kings of the earth to hate the whore and burn her with fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. 2. Chriſt by hindering his ſervants to fight, who were but private men as to any civil power and officers in his Church; hath taught; That private men are not warranted to draw the ſword, were it even in defence of Religion, but they ought to maintain it by ſuffering, when called to that extremity. And, That the ſword is not the weapon put in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hands for the defence of Religion. 3. By this inhibition alſo, as it relates to <hi>Pilates</hi> apprehenſions, we are taught, That it is not lawful for profeſſours of Religion to take up armes for this end, that they may, under pretext of Religion, ſet up any ſuch Kingdome as <hi>Pilate</hi> might apprehend, to the prejudice of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrate; But it is the will of Chriſt, That they enjoy their power and dignity (they allowing Chriſt the exerciſe of his ſpiritual Kingdome) That Religion commend it ſelfe by loyalty to authority, and by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſedition; and, That Religion or Saintſhip be no ſufficient ground to warrant men to entitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any power in the State, to which they have no lawful calling; but rather, That it teach them to keep and adorne their ſtations. 4. Whatever caſe may warrant fighting in defence of Religion, yet the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof is but very accidental, as to this great end
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48148:195"/>
of promoting the ſpiritual Kingdome of Chriſt; for, not only did the Goſpel overſpread much of the world, by the preaching and ſufferings of profeſſours, before Magiſtrates did befriend it; but even their power, when it is employed, can but reach to ſet up the outward exerciſe of Religion, and to the repelling of external force, but can, its alone, do nothing to the conſcience, or to the keeping out of Satan, which is effectuate only by Chriſts Spirit accompanying and bleſſing his own ſpiritual weapons. <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. Mens practice is the cleareſt proofe of their way and inclinations, whereby men ought in charity to judge of them, unleſſe they have ſtrong evidences to the contrary: Therefore upon this, that his ſervants did not fight, Chriſt clearly inferreth, <hi>But now is my Kingdome not from hence.</hi>

                     </gap>, more particularly, that he came into the world, to beat witneſſe to this truth, that he was a King, and ſo to publiſh that decree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, 7. and avow it to the death. 2. He addeth, that <hi>every one that is of the truth heareth his voyce;</hi> whereby he prevents an objection that might be moved againſt the truth of his doctrine and witneſſe, as being ſo ill entertained; and cleareth, that, however few do receive it, either his doctrine in general, or this in particular, that he is a King: Yet, this doth not make void the truth thereof, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all who are of the truth, or borne of God, and begotten by the Word of truth, and who love the truth, and do not delight in lyes, will hear him, and embrace his doctrine and teſtimony. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers may expect they will have to do with politick and quick ſighted men, who will ſift all their diſcourſes, and draw out their minde concerning theſe things wherein they think they may have moſt advantage of them; for, ſo doth <hi>Pilate,</hi> upon Chriſts former diſcourſe, urge him to ſpeak it out, <hi>Art thou a King then?</hi> Yet not ſo much (as appears from the ſequel, in that he troubled him not for it) becauſe of any fear he had of his Kingdome, as to try if he would adhere to ſuch a ridiculous-like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which in his judgement might expoſe him to mockery and contempt. 2. Truth ought to be ſtoutly maintained and avowed, when we are called to it, how abſurd ſo ever it ſeem to be in it ſelfe, and how unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſo ever it ſeem to be unto men; for, ſo doth Chriſt here anſwer, <hi>Thou ſayeſt that I am a King,</hi> or, it is ſo, as thou ſayeſt, and thou tightly gathereſt it from my words. A ſtout confeſſion, as to the matter of it, and yet modeſt, as to the manner, in that he doth it not vauntingly, but ſimply, <hi>thou ſayeſt it,</hi> and after cleareth that he did it out of conſcience and duty; to ſhew that courage and modeſty muſt go together in owning of truth. 3. Chriſt is indeed King of his Church; And where he gathereth his Church, there he ſets up his Kingdome, wherein his laws are to be obeyed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by his ſubjects, and which he will protect and defend, in deſpite of all his enemies; for, this truth is clearly held out here, for the Churches comfort, <hi>thou ſayeſt that I am a King.</hi> 4. By perſecution the Lord giveth occaſion to his ſervants to publiſh truth, and make it known to the greateſt of men, who poſſibly otherwiſe would never hear ſo much of it, as is then ſpoken in their own audience; for, by Chriſts ſuffering, <hi>Pilate</hi> cometh to hear his doctrine, and that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Kingdome. And beſide this alſo, their very ſufferings invite men to enquire after their doctrine for which they ſuffer; which probably otherwiſe they had not taken notice of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12, 13. 5. Every man is ſent into the world, and employed by God, for ſome end and ſervice, which they ſhould much minde, and labour to be faithful in their employment and truſt, upon all hazards; Therefore doth Chriſt, as man and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, look to the <hi>end</hi> for which he was <hi>born,</hi> and <hi>the cauſe</hi> for which he <hi>came into the world;</hi> which being <hi>to bear witneſſe unto the truth,</hi> therefore he will here avow it on all hazards, even before <hi>Pilate.</hi> 6. As it is the eminent imployment put upon all profeſſours of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they bear witneſſe to the truth, or give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the worth thereof; Partly, by their open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing of it and ſuffering for it, when they are called to it in times of hazard; and partly, in their ordinary carriage, by publiſhing truth in their ſtations, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their walking, thoughts, and reaſonings to it, and by magnifying the truth thereof, in oppoſition to their tentations and diſcouragements, which when men neglect, they will never prove ſtout in ſuffering for it; And particularly, they are bound to bear witneſſe unto the Kingdome of Chriſt: So Chriſt himſelfe is the great Captain of theſe witneſſes; He is the great preacher of truth, whoſe powerful Scepter, as a King, is the Word of truth; who ſtands for the maintenance of truth, and particularly this truth, that he is a King over his own Church, to order the affairs thereof; and, who did ſeal this, and the whole truths of God, by his blood: for, he declareth this to be one of his great ends and works in the world, <hi>to bear witneſſe unto the truth,</hi> as a pattern to all others in their ſtations, and an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all who follow his pattern, that they have ſuch a Champion of truth, who yet doth maintain it, though he come no more into the world in perſon, nor ſuffer any more. 7. Albeit the moſt part of the world do little regard Chriſts doctrine, yet it is the very truth, and all the lovers and friends of truth will own it, and who ſo do otherwiſe, they bewray their own eſtrangement from truth, and are indeed delighters in lyes; for, <hi>every one that is of the truth, heareth my voyce.</hi>

                  <p>In the laſt branch of this part of the chapter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Pilates</hi> carriage and dealing with Chriſts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, after his examination of him, and that in two particulars: The firſt whereof is, that <hi>Pilate</hi> abruptly breaking off the Conference with Chriſt, diſdainfully enquiring what truth is, he goeth forth to the Jews, and abſolveth Chriſt, declaring that he judged him innocent. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt and his followers may ſeem oft-times great fooles in their ſufferings, as ſuffering for things of no moment in the eſteem of men, who (as the Lord oft-times draweth the controverſie for which the godly ſuffer, to a very ſmall haire and point of truth; ſo they account it great folly for men to ſuffer for any divine truth; for, ſo much doth <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> queſtion, <hi>What is truth?</hi> import. He propounds it, not ſo much for ſatisfaction, ſeeing he went out not waiting for an anſwer, as teſtifying that he looked on truth, and particularly, that which Chriſt now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed, as a very trivial thing for him to hazard ſo much upon. 2. Mens own wit and knowledge is ſo great an idol to them, that they can hardly endure to be reputed ignorant, or to eſteem of any truth as excellent, wherewith they are not acquainted; for, this alſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned <hi>Pilates</hi> diſdainful queſtion, to which he will not ſtay for an anſwer. He could not endure to heare that truth commended, the knowledge whereof (as he might gather from Chriſts laſt words) was wanting in him, and the Romanes, who were reputed ſo wiſe a people. 3. Chriſt was cleared, even by his enemies and perſecutors, to be innocent in his own perſon, that beleevers may be confirmed in the faith of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and his ſtanding in their room, and of his fitneſſe for that work, being a ſpotleſſe ſacrifice; Therefore, it is recorded, <hi>that he went out again to the Jewes,</hi> (who would not enter to him, <hi>v.</hi> 29.) <hi>and ſaith unto them, I finde in him no fault at all.</hi> 4. Mens paſſions, and particular prejudices and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments againſt perſons, ought not to blind their judgements, nor byaſſe them in cognoſcing upon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for, this is commendable in <hi>Pilate,</hi> that though he had been ſomewhat commoved, <hi>v.</hi> 35. and not much taken with what Chriſt ſaid of <hi>truth,</hi> yet when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, he ſaith, <hi>I finde in him no fault at all.</hi> 5. The Lord can make uſe, not only of mens natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but, even of their Atheiſtical diſpoſition and contempt of truth and Religion, to bring about the good of ſufferers, when he pleaſeth, in the vindication of their innocency; Whereby he teacheth them to eye him much, who can make what uſe he pleaſeth of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; for, it was <hi>Pilates</hi> contempt of what Chriſt preached of his Kingdome and truth, in the beginning of the verſe which concurreth with his natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to make him think nothing of the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and abſolve him.

If we look on <hi>Pilates</hi> part in this procedure, it may teach; partly, That humane policie, and carnal friends, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing, will readily do Chriſt and his followers little ſucceſſeful ſervice in a ſtrait; for, he doth but deal for Chriſt in a politick way; which did not avail. Partly, that whatever men have of a conſcience of duty, yet that doth not avail before God, ſo long as they put not forth themſelves to the utmoſt, in their ſtations, to ſee that done which is right; for, albeit <hi>Pilates</hi> endeavors ſerve indeed to clear Chriſts innocencie, and that <hi>Pilate</hi> in conſcience judged him ſo; yet all that is not enough in him, ſeeing he did not employ his authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er to reſcue and defend the innocent, but doth only eſſay oratory and policie: and partly, that ſuch as would faithfully follow conſcience and light, had need to hold a looſe g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ip of all other enjoyments and intereſts, and particularly, to avoid affectation of popularity; for, this was <hi>Pilates</hi> ſnare, that though he judged Chriſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48148:196"/>
innocent, and that he ought to be delivered, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to loſe the people; he only uſeth inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and policies, <hi>will ye that I releaſe unto you the King of the Jewes?</hi> 3. If we look on the Jewes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this buſineſs, it may teach, partly, That men obdured and hardned by Gods judicial ſtroak, will neither regard civility, reaſon, nor common ſenſe; light will not convince them, nor equity perſwade them to what is right; for, ſo appeared in theſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jewes: albeit <hi>Pilates</hi> procedure was very effectual in its kinde; for he propounds to their choice with Chriſt, a man whom common civility might make them aſhamed to own, or ſeek to exempt from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and preferre him to Chriſt; He inſinuates his own inclination, and that it ſhould be a courteſie to him, if they would ſeek Jeſus to be releaſed, <hi>Will ye that I releaſe him unto you?</hi> Withal, he names him <hi>the King of the Jewes,</hi> inſinuating that his death would tend to the diſcredit of their Nation, being one bearing ſuch a name, (which they afterward reſent, <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 21.) and accuſing the multitude of levity, who not long ſince had proclaimed him their King and now would have him crucified; And yet all this prevailes not with them, <hi>They cried all again,</hi> (that is, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him, or, <hi>again,</hi> after that former cry, that he would obſerve their cuſtome, in releaſing ſome one, of which, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15 8.) <hi>ſaying, not this man, but Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas. Now Barabbas was a robber;</hi> partly, it teacheth, That no perſons, how vile ſoever, are ſo odious in the eyes of the enemies of God as Chriſt and his followers and friends; for, ſo much did Chriſt find in his own perſon, <hi>Barabbas a robber</hi> being preferred to him. 4 If we look to the hand of God and Chriſt in all this (without which nothing was done in this buſineſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28) it may teach, 1. Chriſt would have it evidently ſeen by us, that he ſuffered by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, and that he loved to do ſo, in that he would not ſuffer any endeavour for his releaſement to ſucceed. 2. He would alſo not be <hi>releaſed,</hi> but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, at the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> that he might prove himſelf the true Paſſeover ſacrificed for us, and dying at ſuch a time, the ſmell of his death might ſpread far and near, by reaſon of the great concourſe at this time. 3. Chriſt hath ſanctified unto his people diſappointments in the matter of deliverance, when otherwiſe it might ſeem probable; hereby alſo encouraging them to ſuffer, when by theſe diſappointments it is clear they ſhould ſuffer; for, he in his own perſon is not releaſed, albeit the Governour endeavoured it. 4. While <hi>Barabbas a robber</hi> is preferred to Chriſt, it may ſerve to put us in minde, that however in himſelf, and as to them who ſought his life, he was moſt innocent; yet conſidering him in his Suretiſhip, he had more to ſuffer for, then ever <hi>Barabbas</hi> committed, and therefore is arreſted by divine juſtice, while the other is permitted to eſcape; And this ſhould invite every one who claimeth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his death, to lay to heart his ſhare in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and crimes which were then charged upon Chriſt. 5. Chriſt hath ſanctified unto the godly, their being worſe eſteemed of in the world then the worſt of men, and their being held unworthy to live on the earth, where many wicked men are tolerate, (See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. — 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.22.) and that even by corrupt Church-men; for, they preferred <hi>Barabbas a robber</hi> to himſelf.</p>

                  <p>The firſt part of this Chapter may be ſummed up in theſe four branches: The firſt whereof (in theſe verſes) containes <hi>Pilates</hi> cruel uſage of Chriſt, by ſcourging of him, <hi>v.</hi> 1 by cauſing to crown him with thornes, and cloath him with purple, <hi>v.</hi> 2. hereby pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his affecting of a ridiculous Kingdome, as he ſuppoſed, and affronting him with ſalutations as a mock-King, and by injurious ſmiting, <hi>v.</hi> 3. If we look on <hi>Pilates</hi> ſcope in all this, it was mainly to gratifie the Jewes by ſome leſſer puniſhment, and to induce them to pity Chriſt thus grievouſly afflicted for their pleaſure, as will appear in the following purpoſe. Hence it is ſubjoyned to the preceding purpoſe with a <hi>Therefore, v</hi> 1. intimating that ſince <hi>Pilates</hi> deſigne ſucceeded not to get him releaſed in ſtead of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> he eſſayed this as another mean, thinking to ſpare his life by ſcourging of him; And albeit ſome of the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts mention this ſcourging after his condemnation, yet <hi>John</hi> doth ſet it down in its own order, which they only recapitulate as a thing done before that. But if we look upon this uſage in it ſelf, it was a part of Chriſts ſuffering for us, both painful, and loading him with contempt and ignominy. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Great men in Gods account are guilty of the faults of their inferiours, when they connive at them, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and repreſſe them, much more when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and enjoine them: Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Pilate took Jeſus and ſcourged him,</hi> becauſe the ſouldiers did it; (as it is <hi>v.</hi> 2. and in the reſt of the Evangeliſts) at his <hi>command,</hi> and he, being preſent, (as is implied, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) gave way to all their cruelty in it. See 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9. 2. As this ſcourging and painful crowning of Chriſt, doth not warrant any to think baſely of him, as if he were without any deſireable form or beauty, (as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2.) but doth rather point him out to his people, as white and ruddie, white in his innocency, and ruddie in his ſufferings, and therefore he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the chief among ten thouſand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. and fairer then the children of men, <hi>Pſal</hi> 45.2. ſo in particular, <hi>his ſcourging,</hi> (which was a reproachful uſage of any ingenuous, and free man, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.37. and 22.25. and was no doubt painful, and ſo much the more painful and violent, as <hi>Pilate</hi> thereby intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to move the Jewes to pity) may point out, 1. The peace of rebel-man was not to be purchaſed at an eaſie rate, nor could his wounds be healed, but by ſharp ſtripes and ſore wounds on his Surety; for, ſo much did his <hi>ſcourging</hi> for our ſakes point out; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. 2. Sin in fallen man hath univerſally ſpread it ſelf through the whole man; ſo that as no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoul, ſo no member of the body is free of it; ſo much may be gathered from this, that all the parts of Chriſts body, (many whereof ſmarted in this <hi>ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> and the reſt by other means) behoved to ſuffer for expiating thereof. 3. Chriſt in his own perſon hath ſanctified that method of proceeding with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, that every one of them who are received by the Father, be alſo ſcourged by outward trials and other exerciſes; for, he their Head and Lord, was <hi>ſcourged. Doct.</hi> 3. His <hi>being crowned with thornes,</hi> beſide what may be gathered from it with the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, ſerveth to teach, 1. That he is the truth and ſubſtance of that type of the ram caught in a thicket by the hornes or head, who was offered up inſtead of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22.13. as he is in ſtead of his people. 2. That his ſufferings, however ſharp, are indeed his <hi>crown</hi> and his glory, and he accounted ſo of them, that we might learn to glory in his croſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. 3. That his Kingdome on earth is but contemptible in outward appearance, and managed and promoved by much thorny trouble. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.21, 22. 4. Thorns being a curſe following upon mans ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. his bearing thereof in a crown, would teach, that by his ſufferings, he turneth all the curſes of his people into crowns and bleſſings. 5.

The Kingdome of Chriſt, being ſpiritual, is accounted but folly and matter of deriſion to the world; for, ſo much doth their carriage toward him, as a King, teach. 2. Chriſt in his perſon hath ſanctified unto his people, their being made ſpectacles and a matter of deriſion to the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, 13. <hi>Pſal</hi> 123 4. for, he in his own perſon did endure this bitter ſcorn. 3. Chriſt by ſuffering for alledged affecting of Royaltie and a Kingdome, hath expiate the high preſumption of his people, in affecting to be like God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5, 4. His enduring of this mockage for his people, points out what contempt and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion abides them who are not in him; for, if this be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</p>

                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:48148:197"/>In the ſecond branch of this part of the chapter is recorded what was <hi>Pilates</hi> ſcope in all this; to wit, not that he might revenge or puniſh any real fault in Chriſt, but that having gratified them this far, by afflicting the innocent, leſt they ſhould be accounted injuſt in accuſing him, they would now in pity be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and crave no more to be done to him. For which end, having thus dealt with Chriſt in the judgment-hall, he goeth forth <hi>again,</hi> (after the former time, <hi>chap.</hi> 18.28, 29.) to the Jewes who ſtayed without, declaring how he had found Chriſt innocent, and therefore could not condemn him, but would preſent him to them, to ſee if they would be perſwaded to let him go; and withal, he would let them ſee what he he had done to him, to gratifie them, and to move them to pity. And accordingly, he is brought forth in that ſad poſture, and preſented as an object of pity and compaſſion. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The tenderneſſe of mens conſcience cannot be known or tried ſo much by their propounding of a good end, as by their chooſing of cleanly and warrantable means, for attaining their end, for, <hi>Pilates</hi> end was good in ſeeking to have Chriſt delivered, but he chooſed wrong means, in that he dealt ſo cruelly with the innocent, and cared not to ſend him away with ignominy and great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo he got him delivered. 1. It is no new trial for innocents, to meet with many affronts and injuries in their trials, if it were but to gratifie their accuſers, and ſalve their credit; for, Chriſt is here found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and yet he muſt not come off, nor be brought out to be delivered by them, but when he is all pained and bloody, and <hi>wearing the crown of thornes, and the purple robe,</hi> leſt they ſhould be rubbed upon, as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him injuſtly. 3. Chriſt in his ſufferings was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of any perſonal crime, even in the conſciences of his perſecutors; whereby the Lord made it clear, that his ſufferings were for others; for, ſaith <hi>Pilate,</hi> not only here, but often, <hi>I finde no fault in him;</hi> and he <hi>brought him forth that they might know</hi> this, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by bringing him forth, that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, and that he deſired they would reſt ſatisfied with what he had done. 4. Whatever men may have of a natural conſcience, yet well-doing is above the power thereof, it will only tend to further their own condemnation; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> acquits him, <hi>I finde no fault in him,</hi> and yet he abuſeth him, and bringeth him out, wearing <hi>the crown of thornes, and purple robe, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Carnal policie in Gods wayes will never do any good, but rather tend to greater trouble; for, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> policie in ſcourging and abuſing of Chriſt, and bringing him out with <hi>the crown of thornes, and purple robe,</hi> is ſo far from delivering him, that it augments his trouble, and he is both ſcourged and crucified, whereas he might otherwiſe have been crucified only. 6. It is an evidence of monſtrous cruelty in men, when not only the innocency of ſufferers, but their bitter ſufferings, though innocent, will not molliſie their hearts, and aſſwage their fury; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> propounds Chriſt thus abuſed, as an object pleading for pity, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man.</hi> And whatever uſe they made of this ſight, yet we ſhould behold the Son of God in that his deep exinanition, not carnally to pity him, but in his example and lot, to learn condeſcendence and ſtooping, and obedience and ſubjection to the Will of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 25.6, 7, 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. to ſtudy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſin, that we may abhorre it, and to reade his love toward his peuple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.</p>

Perſecutors will not be ſatisfied with any meaſure of affliction, ſo long as Chriſt, or his truth, or cauſe have anie life in them; for, <hi>when the chiefe Prieſts and officers ſaw him, they cried out, ſaying, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, crucifie him,</hi> as thirſting for his death, though he was already ſore afflicted; and what they cannot obtain with reaſon, they will endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in it by impudent importunity, and tumultuous out-cries. 2. Chriſt ſubmitted to be denied all pity in his ſufferings, and to have mens face hid from him; not only that he might ſanctifie ſuch a lot to his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but that they might finde bowels of pity under their troubles, in ſo far as ſhall be for their good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.11. and 31.20. for, ſo much may be gathered from this part of his ſuffering, that he found no compaſſion, but was cruelly purſued. 3. Divine juſtice, purſuing ſin, could not be ſatisfied, but only by the death of the Surety of ſinners, nor could that burning fire be quenched but by his blood, for, there was an over-ruling hand of God, craving for compleat ſatisfaction to juſtice, in his being <hi>crucified.</hi> 4. A natural conſcience may cleave long to truth and duty, againſt much oppoſition, and yet at laſt quit it; for, ſo much appears in <hi>Pilate,</hi> who notwithſtanding all this vehemency, yet ſtands by his point, <hi>Take ye him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and crucifie him,</hi> (of the meaning whereof, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 18.31.) <hi>for I finde no fault in him.</hi> He declines for their pleaſure to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie an innocent, and will rather let them do it, then put his hand to it. Only it is to be marked, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this permiſſion point out chiefly a ſad reflexion on their cruelty and injuſtice; yet it inſinuates alſo that his chief ſcope was to be rid of this proceſſe, ſince he could not get his will; but that ſucceeds not, ſince he employed not his power to reſcue the innocent. And indeed, when men have any light or conſcience in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48148:198"/>
trying times and caſes, they will not get leave to lurk, but muſt either cloſely follow their light, and act by it in their ſtations, or elſe they will be given up to go over the belly of light and act againſt it, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did. 5. Perſecutors are inceſſant and endleſſe in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, plots and calumnies, againſt Chriſt and his followers; And when one plot or accuſation miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrieth, they will be ſure to finde another; for, ſo do they here, when the former challenge, that he made himſelfe a King, avails not, they bring another, and do not claime to any power upon <hi>Pilates</hi> conceſſion, but do take upon them only to point out the law. 6. Where Religion keeps not the firſt place, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no zeal, whatever men do pretend; for, in this they bewray their unſoundneſſe, that this accuſation of blaſphemy cometh in the ſecond place, after that of his being an enemy to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> which they firſt propounded, as was cleared on <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.33. 7. Such as are indeed blaſphemers, and do arrogate to themſelves what is proper to God only, by the law of God they ought to be put to death; for, it was indeed agreeable to the law, and may be taken in as a branch of that law againſt blaſphemy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.16. that he <hi>ought to die,</hi> who <hi>maketh himſelfe the Son of God.</hi> But Chriſt was not guilty, who did not <hi>make himſelfe,</hi> but was indeed, <hi>the Son of God.</hi> 8. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee corrupt and bloody men cry down moſt neceſſary and ſaving truths as blaſphemous errours, and to abuſe and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply Scriptures for that end, and to deceive others; for, they reckon that ſaving truth of Chriſts Godhead to be blaſphemy, and wreſt the Scriptures to draw <hi>Pilate</hi> to be of their minde, <hi>we have a law, and by our law he ought to die,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt branch of this part of the Chapter, we have recorded ſome conſequents and effects following upon this laſt accuſation, before <hi>Pilate</hi> is perſwaded to condemne him. And in the firſt place, (in theſe verſes) is declared, that <hi>Pilate</hi> hearing this, is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to their deſire, that he is the more afraid, hearing tell of the divinity of him whom he judged to be innocent, and of whoſe fame he (no doubt) heard much, <hi>v.</hi> 8. And, that ſtudying to informe himſelfe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, by conference with Chriſt himſelfe, he gets no anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is evident to right diſcerners, that all the deſignes and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived plots of perſecutors would little availe, but rather turn to their prejudice and diſappointment, if the Lord ſee it ſit to exempt his people from trial; for, albeit God would not have Chriſt delivered, yet this new accuſation doth not make <hi>Pilate</hi> more forward to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Chriſt, but <hi>more afraid</hi> to meddle with him. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30. 2. Such as do but halt in following their duty, will have more fear and trouble, then even ſufferers who walk ſtreightly; for, it is inſinuate that <hi>Pilate,</hi> who did not cloſely follow his light, had fear before, and now <hi>he was more afraid</hi> upon this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as having walked upon ſo unſafe grounds. 3. Serious thoughts of a deity will ſtrike terrour, even in a natural heart and conſcience, eſpecially when they are following a courſe which their own conſcience cannot approve; for, <hi>when he heard that ſaying,</hi> of his making himſelfe <hi>the Son of God, he was the more afraid,</hi> conſidering what he had done to him, and that contrary to his light. And albeit it be not ſufficient, that men have a fear or horrour only upon the thoughts of a Godhead, unleſſe it be ſeaſoned with love; Yet they come far ſhort of <hi>Pilate</hi> who have not ſo much. 4. Impartial obſervers, and even the natural conſciences of men, might have had ſtrong apprehenſions of the divinity of Chriſt, notwithſtanding the abject-like condition of his perſon; for, albeit Chriſt was in the forme of a ſervant, and now in a low condition before <hi>Pilate,</hi> yet <hi>when he heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid,</hi> as ſuſpecting it might be true that he was the Son of God. And this he might conjecture, not ſo much becauſe Pagans did fancy that their idol gods did deſcend in humane ſhape, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.11. as that his minde was illuminate to conſider what they ſaid, and compare it with the ſame that went of Chriſts miracles. 5. Such as have any ſmall beam of light concerning Chriſt, ought to help and encreaſe it by enquiry and ſearch; for, ſo doth <hi>Pilate</hi> enquire, <hi>whence art thou?</hi> or, what is thy Original and parentage. 6. The beſt way to know Chriſt, is, to learn it from himſelfe, who only can reveal himſelfe, and declare what he is; for, ſo much may be gathered from <hi>Pilates</hi> practice, though he ſaw not ſo far into it himſelfe, <hi>He went again into the judgement hall, and ſaith unto Jeſus, whence art thou?</hi> 7. That Jeſus gave him no anſwer, may hold out, 1. On Chriſts part, He ſtood not there now to defend himſelfe, or impede his ſufferings; and therefore he will not diſcover that which might deterre him; So willing was he to pay that ranſome for his people. 2. For beleevers cauſe, He was content to anſwer many queſtions and accuſations with ſilence, that he might purchaſe unto them the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and liberty and boldneſſe to ſpeak unto God. 3. On <hi>Pilates</hi> part, it may not only be conceived that <hi>Pilate</hi> was incapable of ſuch a myſtery; but further, 1. His ſeeking of light in this particular flowed not from love; and ſuch ſeeking hath no promiſe to come ſpeed. 2. He had ſleighted truth when it had been revealed to him before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.38. and ſuch as do ſo, are juſtly deprived of further information. 3. By this refuſall of an anſwer, Chriſt would diſcover ſome naughtineſſe in his heart, as appeareth from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe. And this is Chriſts uſual way with thoſe that converſe with him, to try and cauſe them diſcover what is in their boſome; And he doth this very often by ſuſpending the ſatisfaction of their deſires, at leaſt for a time.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, <hi>Pilate</hi> being offended at Chriſts ſilence, and that (as he judged) he conſidered not whom he miſregarded, and that he had power to diſpoſe of him at his pleaſure; Chriſt, out of zeal to his Fathers honour, and in oppoſition to <hi>Pilates</hi> pride, Anſwers, 1. Concerning his power, that he had no power againſt him, unleſſe it were given him of God: Whereby we are to underſtand, in general, that he had no abſolute power or authority (as no man elſe) over him or any other, but he was ſubordinate to God in it, from whom it was given. Hence in particular, it followeth, partly, That he had no right or authority over him who was an innocent, to do him wrong, ſince no ſuch authority was given him from above; Nor had he power to judge of him or his cauſe, who was God alſo, without eſpecial diſpenſation of God, but he might have eſcaped their hands, as oft-times formerly he had done. And partly, That however, notwithſtanding he had no right, he would be at it, to act againſt him; Yet it was not in his power to execute any ſuch purpoſe, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God. And ſo in ſumme, Chriſt refutes his proud boaſting of his power, by letting him ſee, that there was a power above him, to whom his power and authority was ſubordinate and ſubject, that it was by a particular diſpenſation he had any power over him; and, that he had no right to do wrong as he pleaſed to any, (though he boaſted of it) nor could he execute any ſuch purpoſe, without the permiſſion of God. 2. Chriſt anſwers concerning <hi>Judas</hi> and the Jews who had delivered him into his hands, and declareth that however he ſhould ſin in employing his power to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, yet they had greater ſin who put him in his power, and had treacherouſly betrayed and given him up. This is ſubjoyned to the former, by way of inference and concluſion, <hi>Therefore he hath the greater ſin,</hi> And it concludes not only thus upon <hi>Pilates</hi> proud boaſt, that the greater his power was, as he alleaged, <hi>v.</hi> 10, the greater was their ſin who put him under the hazard of ſuch a power; But more clearly upon Chriſts former ſpeech, thus; If his power was of God, they ſinned the more, who would have him abuſe that power, by crucifying of him, and eſpecially they who knew more from the Scriptures of the ſubordination of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane powers to God, and what Chriſt was, then <hi>Pilate</hi> did. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Superficial tinctures of good in unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed men will ſoon appear what they are, if they get a tentation; for, albeit <hi>Pilate</hi> had even now been <hi>afraid,</hi> of what he had heard ſpoken of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 8. yet now, when he is irritate with his ſilence, he appears in his own colours, <hi>ſpeakeſt thou not unto me,</hi> &amp;c? 2. Mens pride and conceit of their own greatneſſe and power, if they be in any authority, will readily cauſe them miſcarry, upon the leaſt appearance of provocation; for, this did miſlead <hi>Pilate</hi> here, <hi>Speakeſt thou not unto me? knoweſt thou not that I have power,</hi> &amp;c? 3. It is the great ſinne and ſnare of men in power, that they think they may employ their power as they pleaſe, and may diſpoſe of theſe who are under them, according to their own humour and will, without controulment or oppoſition; for, this was <hi>Pilates</hi> reckoning here; Albeit in his conſcience he had abſolved Chriſt as innocent, and therefore would have had him releaſed as one whom he might not wrong, yet when his pride is aloft, he thinks he may do what he pleaſeth, <hi>knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee?</hi> 4. Men in their proud fits, care not what ſnare they run upon, nor what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience they follow, ſo their pride get a vent, and they get leave to inſult and boaſt; for, <hi>Pilate,</hi> in this proud boaſting, doth not conſider nor regard that his own confeſſion that he <hi>had power to releaſe Chriſt,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him if he did not releaſe him, but he muſt ſpeak out his proud thoughts, whatever be the conſequents. 5. Proud and inſolent boaſting of men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill not finde Chriſt ſilent, but whatever elſe it be that he ſeem to take no notice of, he will be ſure to appear againſt pride, eſpecially when it reflects upon God, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and protection his ſuffering people enjoy in him; for, Chriſt, who even now would not anſwer any thing, doth in this caſe <hi>anſwer,</hi> and is not ſilent. 6. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men on earth boaſt of their power and authority, yet in their higheſt ſtate, they are ſubordinate and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God, and muſt be accountable to him, and are overruled by him; for, ſo much is held out here, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all, except it were given thee from above.</hi> 7. As no man can have any lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but what is warranted by God; So no authority or power which men have, doth warrant them to do any thing againſt innocent men or juſtice; Nor ſhould they reckon that they can do any thing, but what they may warrantably and lawfully do; for, ſo much alſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this, Men <hi>have no power</hi> (or <hi>authority</hi> or right) <hi>except what is given from above,</hi> and ſo, as they may not uſurp power, ſo they may not employ it as they pleaſe, (<hi>Mic.</hi> 2.1.) but as God approveth. 8. That Chriſt was under the power of any man, how eminent ſo ever, did ſlow from the peculiar diſpenſation of God, who ordered it to be ſo for the Redemption of his people, and not becauſe he was obnoxious to their power, being the true God, and innocent in his own perſon as man; for, this holds true of him in a peculiar way, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> 9. When Chriſt or his followers are in the hands of men, they ſhould ſo look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their hands, as being firſt and chiefly in the hand of God, without whoſe permiſſion they can neither conclude nor execute any thing; But either he will overrule and diſappoint them, or what they do, his people ought to ſee his hand in it: for, ſo much further may be gathered from this, for the comfort or beleevers, that however great men, oft-times, will not reſpect what is right or wrong, yet it may ſtill be ſaid, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> 10. Albeit all be guilty of ſinne who have hand in perſecuting of Chriſt; Yet the ſame ſin may be more hainous in one then another, and is capable of many aggravations, conſidering the perſons who act it, and other circumſtances: for here. <hi>Judas</hi> and the Jewes <hi>have the greater ſin;</hi> Albeit <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſin in it, yet they had greater ſinne, and their ſin was the more odious, conſidering who they were, and what they did, 11. Such as treacherouſly betray Chriſt and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48148:199"/>
and do inſtigate civil powers againſt them, may be more guilty, in Gods account, then they who deal with open violence againſt them; for, this was a part of the aggravation of their ſin, that they betrayed and gave him up to the civil power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He Judas,</hi> or the Jewes, who are ſpoken of indefinitly and in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) <hi>that delivered me unto thee, hath the greater ſinne.</hi> 12. It is a very great aggravation of the ſin of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when they will not content themſelves to ſatisfie their rage by violence upon any terms; but will have mens authority, which is the Ordinance of God, proſtitute and abuſed to ſatisfie their cruelty, and will have oppreſſion and perſecution acted under the ſpecious pretext of juſtice; <hi>Therefore</hi> (becauſe thou haſt no power, except it be given thee) <hi>he that delivered me unto thee,</hi> that thou mayeſt abuſe that power in crucifying me, <hi>hath the greater ſin.</hi> 13. As the greateſt height of impiety is readily to be found within the viſible Church; So all the aggravations of ſin are yet further heightned, when it is committed by ſuch, and by men who, having knowledge of what is right, do yet out of malice go wrong, and ſeek to draw others with them: for, <hi>Therefore,</hi> alſo, <hi>he that delivered me unto thee, hath the greater ſin,</hi> becauſe they were members of the viſible Church, and knew better whence men have their authority, and how far Chriſt was above his reach (except by particular diſpenſation) then <hi>Pilate</hi> did: and yet out of malice they perſecuted him, and ſtirred up <hi>Pilate</hi> againſt him.</p>

Mens moral principles and natural conſcience may lead them for a long time to cleave to what is good, notwithſtanding any oppoſition or irritations from without, or ſtirrings of corruption from within; for, albeit <hi>Pilate</hi> in this endeavour, had been not only often oppoſed by the Jewes before, but his corruption had been ſtirred by Chriſts carriage toward him, yet he overcometh all that, and <hi>from thence forth ſought to releaſe him,</hi> though the means he eſſayed be not expreſſed. 2. Natural mens moral principles will lead them to own Chriſt but very ineffectually, and ſo as they may wrong no other important intereſt; for, albeit he yet ſtood for Chriſts releaſment, yet he who boaſted of his power to releaſe Chriſt at his pleaſure, <hi>v.</hi> 10. will not employ his power for that end, but only <hi>ſought to releaſe him,</hi> if it might be with their good liking. 3.

Chriſts enemies are ſo malicious and cruel, that they preferre his ruine to all intereſts and conſiderations whatſoever; for, ſo much doth this renewed challenge hold out, <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſars friend,</hi> &amp;c. They regard not to be accounted negligent and careleſſe in matters of their own law, but do paſſe from their accuſation of blaſphemy, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and return to that of his Kingdome, if ſo be it will carry their point better; and they appear mighty zealous for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and enraged that his Deputy did not regard his intereſt more (though indeed they had no great liking to him) and all that they may get Chriſt crucified, and <hi>Pilate</hi> excited to it. 5.

And in particular, that it was about <hi>the ſixth hour</hi> of the day; Yet <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.25. it is called <hi>the third hour,</hi> when they crucified him, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45. it was <hi>the ſixth hour</hi> when the darkneſſe came on, after he was crucified. For underſtanding and reconciling whereof, it is to be remembred that the Jewes did reckon twelve hours in every day, from Sun-riſing to Sun-ſetting, <hi>John</hi> 11.9. And accordingly ſo many alſo in the night And albeit theſe hours were, for the moſt part in equal, the hours of the day being ſhortned in winter and lengthned in ſummer, and contrariwiſe, theſe of the night; Yet at the time of Chriſts paſſion (being near or at the Aequinox) they were equal, the Sun-riſing about ſix a clock according to our account. Again, as they divided the hours of the night in four watches, reckoning three houres to a watch (of which ſee <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.19 <hi>Luke</hi> 12.38. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.25.) So they alſo divided the hours of the day in four quadrants or great hours, for ordering the time of their Sacrifices, and ordinary prayer, which they went about thrice a day. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. The firſt was called <hi>the third hour,</hi> anſwering to our ninth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.3. and was the time of morning prayer, and ſacrifice in the Temple. The ſecond was called <hi>the ſixth hour,</hi> Matth. 20.5. anſwering to our twelfth. And this alſo was an hour of prayer, <hi>Pſal</hi> 55.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 10 9. The third was called the <hi>ninth</hi> hour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.5. Anſwering to our three afternoone, and this was the time of evening prayer and ſacrifice, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. and 10.3. And the laſt (anſwering to our ſixth at night) was called the twelfth, being the time of their retirement from labour, and beginning of the firſt night-watch, and ſo they who wrought but one hour are ſaid to be hired at the eleventh hour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6, 12. Now theſe differences among the Evangeliſts may eaſily be reconciled thus, That the time of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying was when the third (or ninth) hour was paſſed, and the time interveening betwixt that and the ſixth (or twelfth) hour was begun, or poſſible much of it ſpent; and, That this time interveening is ſometime named from the third hour already paſſed, and ſometime from the ſixth or twelfth current, which is the cauſe of the ſeeming difference; So Chriſt was condemned and nailed to the croſſe ſometime after the ninth hour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our account, and before the twelfth, after which the darkneſſe followed at or about the ſixth hour, or ſome ſhort time after it. The difference alſo may be reconciled by taking in the <hi>Roman</hi> way of reckoning the hours with that of the Jewes. They reckoned (as we do) from mid-night to mid-day, and again from mid-day to mid-night, aſſigning to each of them twelve equal hours. And ſo we may conceive that <hi>John</hi> reckons the time of <hi>Pilates</hi> ſitting down in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat to ſentence Chriſt, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> account, that it was about our ſix in the morning, and the Jewiſh firſt hour of the day, and that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> reckon the time after the manner of the Jewes. And as it needs not ſeem ſtrange, that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of the action of a <hi>Roman,</hi> do deſigne the time thereof according to the <hi>Roman</hi> account; So this reckoning leaveth ſufficient time for all that is related by any of the Evangeliſts to have been done betwixt <hi>Pilates</hi> ſitting down in the judgement ſeat, and their crucifying of Chriſt. 3. We have to conſider ſome previous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Pilate,</hi> after he is ſet in judgement, before he give out the ſentence, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15 Wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Chriſt to the Jewes as their King, and they refuſing him, and crying out that he ſhould be crucified, he againe urgeth how unmeet it was they ſhould deſire him to crucifie their King; but they rejecting him, and acknowledging <hi>Caeſar</hi> only, he proceeds to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In all which we are to conceive, that <hi>Pilate,</hi> being reſolved not to incurre <hi>Caeſars</hi> diſpleaſure, wherewith they threatned him, is but ſeeking ſome ſhift to ſatisfie or quiet his own conſcience. And therefore he will offer him unto them as their King, being willing to deliver him, if they will accept of him; but ſeeing they, who were more concerned then he, do reiect him, he thinks he is not bound to inſiſt any longer. To which, other conſiderations, blindfolding him, are to added, as they are marked by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt: Namely, that he waſhed his hands in teſtimony of his innocency, and laid his blood upon them, and they took it on; and, that he thought he could do no good by ſtruggling, but rather occaſion a tumult, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.24. and therefore (as natural men will not hazard on a duty unleſſe they ſee ſome probability of ſucceſſe, far leſſe will they hazard where difficulties occurre) he thinks it better to let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then to loſe the people, and run the hazard of <hi>Caeſars</hi> diſpleaſure. 4. Unto all this the ſentence it ſelfe is ſubjoyned, <hi>v.</hi> 16.—that he delivered him to them to be crucified, or gave out ſentence, and delivered him over that it might be executed. He delivered him <hi>to them,</hi> or, to the Jewes, not that they were the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, for the Souldiers acted that part; but in all this he gratified them, and he committed it to them, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee and ſatisfie themſelves in the execution, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they went along with the Souldiers, to ſee that nothing was omitted.</p>
                  <p>From this purpoſe, thus cleared, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men who ſeem to act for Chriſt, and yet entertain an Idol, may expect that it will be touched ere all be done, to try whether they reſpect Chriſt or it moſt; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> meets with a <hi>ſaying,</hi> that touched the very Idol of his intereſt and credit with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> 2. Men are never throughly tried, till their duty come in competition with their Idol and intereſt; And they who ſtand out very ſtoutly before, may then ſuccumb and give over, as all men who want ſaving grace will do; for, <hi>when Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late therefore heard that ſaying, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſate down in the judgement ſeat</hi> &amp;c. He could ſtand it out no longer, when avowing of Chriſt come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour. So that they lay ſnares for themſelves who entertain Idols. 3. Albeit natural men may oft-times, wiſh well to Chriſt and his intereſt, yet they will not part with any thing for him, if the matter be in their choice; And particularly, they will not incurre the diſpleaſure of great ones for his ſake; for, albeit he deſired Chriſt might be releaſed, yet he will <hi>ſit down in the judgement ſeat,</hi> and condemne Chriſt, before he hazard the loſſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour, and what might follow upon that. Natural men may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be involved in the common calamities of a war with others, in defence of Religion, and may lye under
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48148:200"/>
the neceſſity of loſing much that way; but they will not freely undergo any thing, in a way of ſuffering of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and particular perſecution. 4. Albeit the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of mens intereſts and idols withdraw them from duty to Chriſt, as thinking thereby to preſerve them, yet ordinarily ſuch projects ſucceed not, but whatever it be that tempts men to forſake and relinquiſh their duty to Chriſt, it doth juſtly diſappoint and ruine them; for, the keeping of <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour, and to pleaſe the Jewes alſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.15. made <hi>Pilate</hi> condemne Chriſt, and yet (as Hiſtories record) he loſt that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affections, and they by their complaints made him to loſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour, ſo that he cut off himſelf. 5. Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemies of Chriſt are moſt obſtinate in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and violence againſt him, and this is to be expected from them; Therefore is the time marked, that <hi>it was the preparation of the Paſſeover, and about the ſixth houre,</hi> to point out the Jewes obſtinacy, that albeit they had been at it all night, and now the day of their preparation is come, yet they endure all this, and lay aſide all other things till they be ſatisfied in this. 6. Chriſt ſtooped to be kept long in pain and bonds, and to have his ſufferings lengthened by all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that were uſed for his releaſe; That ſo he might expiate our guilt, which deſerveth indeed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſufferings, if it were laid on us; That he might, by his example, warn us to prepare for trials of long continuance, and by his going before us, ſanctifie them unto us; That he might be a meet High Prieſt for them who are ready to weary and ſink under the continuance of their trials: and, That he might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie unto his people the lengthening of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by any means uſed for their deliverance; for theſe cauſes alſo it is marked, that after all his toile in the preceding night, he is kept in bonds, wearied and pained with ſcourging, crowning with thornes and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till <hi>the ſixth houre,</hi> and that before he come to the extremity of his ſuffering. 7. The conſciences, even of natural men, after they have begun to point out duty, will not ſoon be ſatisfied nor ſilenced, no, not when they meet with ſtrong tentations; for, albeit <hi>Pilate</hi> be ſo daſhed with the fear of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that he ſits down on the Judgement-ſeat, yet his conſcience will not let him proceed to ſentence, till he follow ſuch a courſe as he thinks may ſatisfie it, as hath been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo that men who have made defection from a good courſe, have certainly more diſquiet from their conſciences then every one knoweth. And if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a Counſellor and Informer be ſo difficult to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, it will be much more ſo, when it turnes a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor and executioner. 8. When men are once broken, and reſolved to go contrary to conſcience, they will finde ſtrange ſhifts, and deviſe principles of light, to heal the wound of conſcience, and that they may not ſeem to croſſe it; for, ſo much do <hi>Pilates</hi> Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them point at, as hath been explained. It is dangerous when men are once engaged in their wicked reſolutions, for then their wits are ſet on work, not to finde out what is right, but, what may make their way plauſible to themſelves or others, and may ſtop the mouth of conſcience. 9. It is but a poor ſhift for men to think to ſatisfie their conſciences with their good wiſhes, and weak endeavours about their duty, when yet they ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with the importunity of others, and do not effectually ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what is right; for, herein <hi>Pilate</hi> ſatisfieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he offers their King to them, <hi>Behold your King,</hi> and evidenceth an averſeneſſe from proceeding, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> but is croſſed with their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Away with him, &amp;c.</hi> 10. It will not ſatisfie conſcience, that men have others more concerned and knowing then themſelves, (upon whom they think they may lay the blame of any evil) ſo long as they ſuffer any thing to be done contrary to their truſt and power; for, this is another ſhift of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that ſince the Jewes, who were more concerned in their King, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood theſe things better then he, will have Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, he thinks they ſhould bear the blame. But it was his dutie to have employed his authority and power to hinder injuſtice. 11. When men begin to faint in their duty, and to ſeek ſhifts, it is righteous with God they finde many, and that Satan and his inſtruments be let out to importune them, till they be quite broken in all their reſolutions; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> being in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, juſtly meets with their importunate cries, <hi>Away with him, away with him, crucifie him, we have no King but Caeſar,</hi> to drive him on into the ſnare. 12. It is the great and crying ſin of the viſible Church, that they contemn and neglect the offer of ſalvation, and the meſſengers thereof; and particularly, that they reject Chriſt from reigning over them; for, this was the great ſin of the Jewes here, that they cried, <hi>Away with him, away with him, crucifie him,</hi> and in contempt of him profeſſe, <hi>we have no King but Caeſar.</hi> And this ſin is repeated by all theſe in the viſible Church, who reject and deſpiſe his offer of himſelf in the Goſpel, and who crucifie him afreſh unto themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. 13. Malicious perſecutors will not be mollified in their rage by any conſideration; nor will their political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts or diſcontents, (though otherwiſe weighty in their eyes) engage them to Chriſt or his cauſe, but they will rather ſacrifice all their intereſts, and digeſt all their other diſcontents, then not have Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for, albeit they were exceedingly averſe from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> power over them, and did affect liberty and a King of their own: yet that they may get Chriſt crucified, they digeſt all this, and profeſſe, <hi>we have no King but Caeſar.</hi> And albeit their being under the forreign power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was a clear proof that <hi>Shiloh,</hi> or the Meſſiah was come, yet they are ſo violent as they regard not that. 14. No leſſe was ſufficient to ſatisfie divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the ſins of the Elect, then the death of their Surety; and Chriſt having undertaken this work, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did purſue him to the death: Therefore was it ſo over-ruled, that they cried, <hi>crucifie him,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he is ſentenced and <hi>delivered to be crucified,</hi> after all his former ſufferings. 15. Chriſts followers ſhould reſolve, after they have ſuffered much, to ſuffer yet more; And they ſhould not decline to have all their other ſufferings crowned with a violent death, at laſt, if called to it: for, ſo much alſo doth the example of Chriſt their Head teach them. 16. When a mans conſcience, who ſeemed to befriend Chriſt, is once lulled aſleep, he will be ready to run as great a length in cruelty as any other: And who hath once made ſhipwrack of any kinde of a good conſcience, will come behinde with no enemie, if he turn not worſe; for, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> now overcome, ſatisfieth all their deſire in this
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48148:200"/>
particular, <hi>he delivered him to be crucified.</hi> 17. It may be the lot of Chriſts followers, and an addition to their trial, to be given up to the power of their moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies, to execute all their ſpite upon them; for, ſo fared it with Chriſt in his own perſon, he was <hi>delivered to them,</hi> (or, to the Jewes) <hi>to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond branch of this part of the chapter is contained the execution of the ſentence; That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned, they led him away to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> bearing his own Croſſe, and there crucified him with two other with him, one on either hand. Not to repeat what hath been ſaid of this way of Chriſts ſuffering on <hi>chap.</hi> 18.28. and on <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. where a Providence is obſerved in it; we may from this purpoſe, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Sufferers may expect not only to have cruel reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken, and cruel ſentences given out againſt them, but to have them cruelly execute; for, ſo was it with Chriſt, he being condemned, <hi>they took him and led him away:</hi> And he met with this, not only to ſhew that our ſins deſerved not only threatned, but real inflicted puniſhment: or, to purchaſe to his followers many a ſweet diſappointment in their ſufferings; but that he might ſanctifie ſuch a lot to them, when ſufferings are permitted to come to an extremity. 2. As the Lord marks the activity of perſecutors againſt Chriſt, and propounds it to be marked by his people, to ſhame them when they are negligent for him; (for, therefore doth he record that after his condemnation, <hi>they,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, <hi>took Jeſus and led him away</hi>) ſo his eye is moſt upon them who are moſt malicious againſt him: for, albeit the ſouldiers were actors in this buſineſſe, yet for this cauſe he marks ſpecially, that <hi>they</hi> (or the Jewes to whom <hi>Pilate</hi> delivered him) <hi>took him and led him away.</hi> 3. Chriſt ſubmitted to be accounted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable perſon, and in an execrable condition, and one whom none would own; that ſo we might inherit a bleſſing in him; Therefore <hi>went he forth, bearing his Croſſe,</hi> as one accurſed, whom none in all the company would help to bear his Croſſe, till one was compelled to help him, as the reſt obſerve. 4. It may pleaſe the Lord to let trial and great weakneſſe tryſt together, and to lay on croſſes when we ſeem very unmeet for bearing of them; for, Chriſt after he is wearied all night, and ſpent with former ſufferings, is made to <hi>bear his Croſſe,</hi> till he faint again. 5. Sufferers may get few ſympathizers, even of deareſt friends; and Chriſt endured this lot, that he might be a tender friend to us; for, <hi>he bare his Croſſe,</hi> without any of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to help him, but another muſt be compelled when he needs it. 6. Whatever be our weakneſſe and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement under trial; yet it is our great victory volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to ſubmit and bear it; for, notwithſtanding this his low condition, yet <hi>he bearing his Croſſe, went forth,</hi> and was not drawn, but bears on till he faint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. 7. The place to which he is carried to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is called <hi>the place of a skull,</hi> (which is the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alſo of the Hebrew or Syriack name, <hi>Golgotha,</hi> to which alſo the name <hi>Calvary, Luke</hi> 23.33. agreeth) And it gets this name, not ſo much becauſe the forme of that mountain reſembled a <hi>skull,</hi> as becauſe there were many ſculls of execute malefactours lying or buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. He was brought to this place to ſuffer, not only to ſhew how loathſome we and our ſins are before God, in that our Surety muſt ſuffer in ſo loathſome a place; But further it teacheth, 1. Our Lord is the true ſubſtance of that ſacrifice ſlain without the camp, whoſe blood was brought into the Sanctuary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11, 12. And however he was eſteemed of among men, in ſuffering here; yet his blood hath made way, and opened an entry into heaven. 2. By this he hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the contempt of his people in the world, and taught them to go out unto him, bearing his reproach, who ſuffered without the gate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12, 13, 14. 3. By this he hath ſhewed how by his death he will be death's death, in that he ſuffered and triumphed over death in <hi>the place of a skull,</hi> where there were many monuments of deaths triumph over others. <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. Chriſt by his ſuffering this death of being <hi>crucified,</hi> hath taught us, 1. We by nature are under the curſe, and he hath undergone that curſe, that all who flee to him, may be freed from it, and that all their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be bleſſed, and their very croſſes turned into bleſſings; Therefore did he undergo this curſed death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 2. By his pouring out of his blood, even unto death, which flowed abundantly (as from other places, both before his being crucified, and after his death; ſo alſo) from his hands and feet, He hath pointed out to us, that as there is no remiſſion of ſins without the ſhedding of blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. ſo he hath opened up that fountain for all who come to him. 3. By this way of ſhedding his blood, by piercing of his hands and feet, which were ſenſible parts, and his being hanged up nailed to the Croſſe, to continue in pain for a long time, and his wounds continually wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the weight of his body till he died; we are taught, what the bitter fruit of ſin is, how great his love was that did ſubmit to endure this ſharp and long continuing pain, and, how we are bound to look on him whom we have pierced, till our hearts be pierced and bleed again. 4 His being faſtned and continuing there upon the Croſſe for a ſpace, before he died, may teach, how reſolute he was to endure that aſſault till juſtice were ſatisfied; That he kept and ſtood in the field there, to endure the uttermoſt that enemies could do againſt the work of Redemption, and to grapple with all of them, till they had no more to ſay againſt his people; and, That he would give a proof how certainly he is to be found at his Croſſe, with ſtretched-out armes ready to receive all them who ſeek for life in him, and through his death. 5. His being lifted up thus nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Croſſe, may teach, partly, That we deſerved no room, neither in heaven nor earth, and therefore our Surety was lifted up betwixt both, and hence alſo was the Sun darkned, (as for other cauſes, ſo) to ſhew that we deſerve not ſo much as that the Sun ſhould
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48148:201"/>
ſhine upon us: and partly, That his ſuffering was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his exaltation, he was lifted up in it by trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over his enemies there, and he is exalted in the world as crucified. <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. Albeit Chriſt in his own perſon was the ſpotleſſe Lamb of God; yet ſo hainous and ſo many were the ſins of the Elect charged upon him, that in divine Providence, he is not only reckoned among tranſgreſſours, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. but as the chief of them; Therefore it is ſo ordered, that he is <hi>crucified, and other two with him, and Jeſus in the midſt,</hi> as the moſt notable of them. And this may teach the Elect, not to mince or extenuate their own ſins, which were charged on Chriſt as ſo odious. 10. Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be accounted, and undergo the lot of a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour; not only that he might free us who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed evil-doers, but that he might ſanctifie unto his people their being looked upon, and intreated as evil-doers; Therefore alſo was he crucified in ſuch company.</p>

It is a good uſe to be made of the cutting off of delinquents, that juſtice be cleared, and the guilty aſhamed, and that others be warned to fear; for, upon theſe grounds it was a commendable practice in it ſelf, that <hi>a title was put upon the Croſſe</hi> of malefactours, containing their crime, and the cauſe of their death, and that <hi>it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latine,</hi> that all preſent, of different Nations and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, might reade and underſtand it. 2. Chriſt hath ſanctified his peoples being unjuſtly condemned as traitours, by ſuffering upon that account, and by having this title written over his head, <hi>The King of the Jews.</hi> 3. Chriſts intended ſhame doth tend to the real manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his glory; for, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſet up this title to brand him as an affecter of a worldly Kingdome; but hereby God would have it proclaimed that he is <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth the King of the Jewes;</hi> That he is a King in the midſt of his ſufferings, That he did indeed triumph in them, ſpoiling Satan, and converting one of them that was crucified with him; and, That the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this ſuffering King ſhould be conſpicuous and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all Nations, of all Languages, as this title was written in the three principal Languages. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate and violent enemies againſt Chriſt ſhall meet with perpetual reproach never to be wiped off; for, therefore doth <hi>Pilate</hi> write him <hi>the King of the Jewes,</hi> and that in three languages, that they reading it (as it is <hi>v.</hi> 20.) might reade their own reproach, in having one who was called King of their Nation, crucified, and that in Gods holy Providence, it might be their perpetual reproach to have crucified him who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their King. 5. The Lord leaveth cruel perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be ambitious and tender of their own credit, when he is to affront them; that as they have ſerved themſelves of their luſts and idols, ſo he alſo may ſerve himſelf of them, to make them the more ſenſible of their affronts: therefore it is marked, that when they read this title, the croſſe being near the City, <hi>v.</hi> 20. their ambition renders the affront of this more grievous to them, and they deſire to have it altered, <hi>Then ſaid the chief Prieſts of the Jewes to Pilate, write not, the King of the Jewes, but that he ſaid, I am the King of the Jewes.</hi> 6. Such as are not tender of Gods honour, and of Chriſt and his intereſt in the world, God in his juſtice will be little tender of them, their idols and intereſts, when they come to be rubbed upon; for, in this anſwer of <hi>Pilate, What I have written, I have written,</hi> we are not only to look to <hi>Pilate,</hi> as clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to their Romane cuſtomes, which did not admit that their publike Programmes or Tables ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered after they were publiſhed; nor yet only as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with inexotableneſſe, who had been ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable to his deſire of releaſing Chriſt: But we are chiefly to look to the hand of God, who will not have their ambition ſatisfied, nor allow any tenderneſſe in the matter of their ſuppoſed credit, who had ſo cruelly purſued Chriſt to death. 7. Gods decree, concerning the Kingdome of Chriſt, is immutable, nor will he have the glory of it obſcured or born down by any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for, ſo much alſo doth this anſwer of <hi>Pilate</hi> point out, that as Chriſt was the King of the Jewes, however they fretted, ſo the Lord in his Providence would not have the publication thereof on the Croſſe hindered by any entreaty of theirs, and therefore <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> is over-ruled to anſwer, <hi>What I have written, I have written.</hi>

                  <p>In the fourth branch of this part of the chapter, Chriſts ſuffering from the ſouldiers is recorded; That having ſtripped him of his garments when they faſtened him to the Croſſe, they do divide theſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which could be parted among them, and caſt lots for his woven coat which could not be divided. All which was done according to that foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.18. which whatever accompliſhment it had in <hi>David</hi> the type, yet it pointed ultimately at Chriſts ſufferings. Not to ſeek any Allegory, we may from this purpoſe, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Inſtruments will not be wanting to crucifie Chriſt, if it were but for his old cloathes, and theſe but little worth; for, theſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers crucifie him, though they got but his <hi>garments</hi> for their reward. 2. Chriſt did ſubmit not only to be crucified, but to ſuffer naked, the ſouldiers dividing his garments and coat among them, hereby to teach us, 1. That all fleſh are really naked before God by reaſon of ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.25. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.19. and therefore our Surety behoved to ſuffer naked. 2. That he offered himſelf a real captive in his ſufferings, that ſo he might fully ſatisfie juſtice, by being under the power of his enemies, till he redeemed himſelf by the ſtrong hand, having fully paid the price; for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he ſubmit to be ſtript naked, as Conquerours uſe to do with priſoners. 3. That by this ſuffering naked, he would expiate our abuſe of apparel, and purchaſe to us a liberty to make uſe of ſuitable ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as becometh us in our ſtation 4. That by this ſuffering naked, he would purchaſe unto them who flee to him, to be covered with righteouſneſſe and glory, and to walk with him in white for ever, and would point out the nakedneſſe of theſe, who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found cloathed with his righteouſneſſe, ſhall not be cloathed upon with immortality and glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. 5. He would alſo, by this, teach all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to reſolve on nakedneſſe in their following of him, as a part of their conformity with their Head, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. and that therefore they ſhould not doat much on their apparel when they have it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. A ſight of God and his Will, in the trials of Chriſt and his followers, will make them very ſweet unto them, and ſhould be a mean to prevent ſtumbling; for this cauſe is it ſubjoyned, that it was done, <hi>that the Scripture might be fulfilled, &amp;c.</hi> 4. God hath a providence about the ſmalleſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſuffering of Chriſt and his followers; for, Scripture had foretold, even concerning the <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts garments, and caſting lots for his veſture,</hi> to ſhew there was a providence in theſe things, though they were but very common. 5. When Chriſt and his people are very low, yet the Scripture ſtands firme, and will not be broken, if it were but about the matter of an old coat; And however Chriſt and his followers be put in the hands of wicked men, led by their wicked principles, yet the leaſt circumſtance of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are over-ruled by God, and men ſhall not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the bounds ſet by him; for, this being foretold, <hi>Theſe things therefore,</hi> (and no more then had been foretold) <hi>the ſouldiers did.</hi> And albeit they did this, and no more, freely, yet it was neceſſary, in regard of the prediction, that they did it, and went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>In the fifth branch of this part of the chapter we have recorded, what was Chriſts care of his mother, who, with two other women, and <hi>John</hi> the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, (as is gathered from <hi>v</hi> 26. with <hi>chap</hi> 21, 20 24.) did ſtand beſide his Croſſe.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) they retired to the reſt, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. This their <hi>ſtanding by the Croſſe of Jeſus,</hi> was not to be any wayes aſſiſting or helpful to him in that great work he was now about; nor yet did it flow only from natural affection, no, not in his mother, but from their faith ſeeing through his ſufferings, and unto what they did tend: nor yet doth it only ſerve as a pattern of Chriſtian practice, teaching us to ſtand beſide his Croſſe, and feed upon his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and our intereſt in them; But further, it may teach, 1. Chriſts followers may have many ſad dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſt and his intereſts; both for their own trial, and that the thoughts of many hearts may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; for, in this ſight, <hi>Mary</hi> found that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed which Chriſt had foretold, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.35. and ſo the reſt alſo, every particular of his ſuffering being a wound to their hearts. 2. Chriſtians are bound not to forſake nor deſert ſuch as ſuffer for truth, but they ſhould be comfortable to them by their ſympathy and countenance, when they can do no more; for, albeit they could not joine with Chriſt in that great work, yet they look upon him as a ſuffering man, and their <hi>ſtanding by the Croſſe,</hi> and their tender looks upon him, were, in their own meaſure, ſweet to him, who had cruel enemies round about him, and many a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and inſolent look upon him in that day, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.17. And their practice toward him is a pattern of our duty toward ſufferers. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. and 4.16,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48148:202"/>
17. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Albeit the generality, even of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, may turn their back upon ſufferers, and they are to expect that as a part of their trial; yet they will not want ſome to countenance them, when God ſeeth it meet; for, here of all his followers a very few did <hi>ſtand by the Croſſe of Jeſus,</hi> and yet a few ſtood by it, <hi>his mother, and his mothers ſiſter,</hi> (or kinſwoman) who was <hi>Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene, with the diſciple whom he loved.</hi> 3. Such as ſeem but weak in reſpect of others, may yet prove ſtronger then they in a trial; and theſe of the weaker ſexe may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to out-ſtrip others; for, all theſe (except <hi>John</hi>) who ſtood by him when the reſt are gone, are weak women. And albeit we are not to aſcribe this courage to any thing in themſelves, even of what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; yet it may be conſidered, that as all of theſe were eminently gracious, and as grace did excite <hi>his mother, and his mothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s ſiſter,</hi> to teſtifie their natural affection to him; ſo alſo in particular, <hi>John</hi> was much beloved of Chriſt, and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had ſeven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils caſt out of her by him: And it may be expected that ſuch as enjoy the ſenſe of Chriſts love, and do entertain the ſenſe of his ſpecial kindneſſe, will cleave to him as long as any. 4. Chriſt takes notice of all who ſincerely teſtifie their affection toward him, and doth indeed reſpect them, though poſſibly they get not all alike expreſſions of his reſpect; for, here all are recorded who <hi>ſtood by the Croſſe of Jeſus,</hi> as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he took notice of their affection, though he ſpeak to none but to his mother and <hi>John,</hi> and doth take particular care of her only, and becauſe of this it is recorded that <hi>he ſaw</hi> them. 5. That Chriſt, in the midſt of this his extream pain and agony, is at leiſure to take notice of his mother and <hi>John,</hi> and to expreſs his care of her; it may teach, partly, How wiſely the Lord doth order the trials of his own, and that he will give them ſuch intermiſſions of the extremity of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, as may be needful for them or their affaires; for, hereof hath he given proof in the ſuffering of his Son, who though he ſtill continued in bodily pain, yet he got ſome intermiſſions and caſe of that overwhelming cloud of ſoul-trouble which purſued him becauſe of our ſins, ſo that he can think of ſomething beſide. Partly, it may teach, That Chriſt, even in his extream ſuffering, began his triumph over it in part, and teſtified himſelf a Conquerour; for, ſo much appears, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that he was alwayes free of any ſinful perturbation which might confuſe his thoughts; but in that his ſinleſſe perplexities alſo are at his command as God, to moderate them when his thoughts were otherwiſe to be employed. And partly, it may teach, That Chriſts heart is at all times upon his people, to perform all duties toward them to which he is bound, either as a man under the Law, or as Mediatour; for, in the extremity of his pain, his free thoughts are upon his mother, to care for her, and upon a beloved diſciple, to give him a proofe of his love in this honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment. And if his thoughts were at this time thus employed, how much more are they ſo in glory, when he hath no exerciſe or ſuffering of his own to take him off? 6. By Chriſts care of his mother at this time, recommending her to <hi>John,</hi> as a mother to a ſon to be cared for, he would teach, 1. That it is the Will of Chriſt, that children honour their Parents, and have a care of them in their decayed and deſolate condition; for, ſo much doth he teach in his own perſon, who was not only ſubject to his mother and his ſuppoſed father in his life, but hath a care of his mother at his death. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. 2. No perſonal trouble or trial upon our ſelves, doth exempt us from the performance of duties toward others, in our relations, nor warrant us to lay thoughts thereof aſide; for, Chriſt in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſuffering, accounts it his duty to provide for his mother at his death. 3. Chriſt is ſo tender, as he will not faile to have a care of them who are little minding their own condition and trials but are chiefly taken up with what concernes him, for, while his mother ſtands by his Croſſe, afflicted and affected with his ſufferings, he is finding out a way how ſhe may be provided and cared for. 4. The Lord never removeth one comfort or mean of ſubſiſtence from his people, but he will provide ſome other to put in the room thereof, in ſo far as is for their good; for, now he is to be removed, who was not only her Redeemer, but comfortable to her as her Son; and albeit none could fill his room, even in that reſpect, yet he provides one who by taking her home, might ſupply her want in ſome meaſure as a Son to her, <hi>Behold, thy Son! Behold thy mother! Doct.</hi> 7. Chriſt calls her <hi>woman,</hi> and not <hi>mother,</hi> in this his care. Not becauſe he would reprehend any fault in her, as <hi>chap.</hi> 2.4. nor yet only becauſe he would not diſcover her to the ſouldiers, who were ſtanding by to be his mother; but that he might teach, That it is the duty of all, eſpecially in their ſuffering, to have the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their affections toward their relations, mixed with the conſcientious diſcharge of duty toward them; that ſo their affections may not blunt them in their great ſervice, and yet they may not neglect any needful or poſſible duty, which might b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing ſcandal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon what they ſuffer for, or their ſuffering for it, Therefore doth he call her <hi>woman,</hi> to teſtifie how far he was above theſe relations in his ſuffering, which teſtified his obedience to the Father, and his love to his people, and yet he neglects not to provide for her. 8. That <hi>John</hi> gets this truſt put upon him, and he takes it on, it may teach, 1. Such as are beloved of Chriſt, and do dwell in the faith thereof, may expect that peculiar advantages ſhall be caſt in their way daily by Chriſt; for, it is <hi>to the diſciple whom he loved,</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy mother,</hi> and puts him on this honourable ſervice. 2. Such as do poſſeſſe and feed upon the love of Chriſt, will deſire no greater benefit and advantage, then to be honoured to do ſervice to any of his; for, this is <hi>Johns</hi> advantage, that Chriſt will ſay to him. <hi>Behold thy mother!</hi> and it ſo affects him, that <hi>from that houre that diſciple took her unto his own home,</hi> or looked upon her, and took care of her, as his mother and one of his family.</p>

                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:48148:202"/>The ſixth branch of this part of the Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the accompliſhment of a Scripture-prophecy, in Chriſts thirſting, and their giving him vineger to drink, immediately before his death. In recording whereof, it is inſinuate, that his thoughts, in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, ran upon his work, and what was appointed him to accompliſh; And that, finding all was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which he was to do before his death, but only that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 21. He, for the accompliſhment thereof, intimates to them that he thirſted, and gets but vineger to drink, according to the prediction. It appeares here, that it was their cuſtome to have vineger at the place of execution; though it be not needful to determine for what uſe they had it; whether, to ſprinkle it in the aire, or for men to make uſe of it to prevent infection, or any evil ſmell by reaſon of the dead bodies; or whether, to apply it to the wounds of the condemned, either to haſten the effuſion of blood and their death, or (as ſome will) contrariwiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their pain, and keep them from fainting. It ſufficeth us to know, that it was not ſo made uſe of here, but given him for drink in their cruelty. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alſo from <hi>Mark</hi> 15.23. that before he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, they offered him <hi>wine mingled with myrrhe,</hi> whereof it ſeems they made uſe of to ſtupifie the ſenſes of the ſufferers, that they might feel no pain; and that they mixed this with vineger and gall when they offered it to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.34. But he refuſed it, and having taſted it would not drink of it; yet now he received ſo much of it, as may be an accompliſhment of the prediction. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All that Chriſt was to endure and ſuffer, came not at randome, nor at the pleaſure of men, but was fore-determined by God, and accordingly recorded in Scripture; for, ſo is imported in that he was about the <hi>accompliſhing of all things,</hi> which were recorded in <hi>the Scripture,</hi> and to <hi>be fulfilled. See Acts</hi> 4.27, 28. 2. Chriſt in his ſuffering did not reſpect his own eaſe, but his great care was to fulfil all things that were enjoyned &amp; appointed for Redemption of his people; that ſo he might teſtifie his love to them, which was not aſleep in his trouble: and might by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teach us, to make it our great care in ſuffering, rather to do our duty, then how to get eaſe and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. Therefore, upon the Croſſe, his ſtudy was to ſee that he did all things requiſite, till he might <hi>know that all things were now accompliſhed.</hi> 3. Chriſt is moſt faithful in fulfilling and making good whatever he hath ſpoken in his Word, and will not have that made void on any termes; for, <hi>knowing that all things were now accompliſhed,</hi> which were to be ſuffered before his death, only this one p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are accompliſhed, he will continue in pain upon the Croſſe, and endure this cruel uſage, <hi>that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</hi> 4. Chriſts extream thirſt may ſerve, partly, to point out unto us the extream vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his ſuffering, that he was ſo heated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward agony, and exhauſted with watching, pain, and effuſion of blood, as drew on a burning thirſt; In all which we ſhould reade his love and condeſcendence, and acknowledge that it is from him we have the eaſe of our ſuffering and exerciſe; partly, to point out, that as Chriſt ſuffered in all his members, to expiate our ſin, ſo particularly, he endured thirſt, which was a ſtroak on his tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15. that he might ſuffer for, and expiate the ſinnes of our tongue; And partly, to point out, that for expiating our ſin in eating and drinking and pleaſing our palate and taſte, and to purchaſe unto us the uſe of the creatures with a bleſſing, he would ſuffer this thirſt, which will be the eternal puniſhment of gluttons, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24, 25. and gets no refreſhment, as after followeth. 5.

ſuffering, but would be active and voluntary in it; that ſo he might commend his love, and teach us to avoid unſenſibleneſſe under trials: Yet now he <hi>receives the vinegar,</hi> and (at leaſt) taſts of it, in teſtimony of his ſubjection to God who had foreprophecied of this lot, and to teach us ſubjection to what God appoints for us in all things. 2. Chriſt cloſed not his ſufferings till all was finiſhed he had to do; He not only endured the utmoſt extremities of enemies malice, and bare them all, but, He fulfilled all Scripture-prophecies, and the ſubſtance of all the types were accompliſhed in him. He fulfilled all that God determined to be payed for expiating of ſin, ſo that no more ranſome is to be payed; And ſo did finiſh the work of our Redemption, and purchaſed that whereby we are perfected for ever: for, ſaith he, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> whereby he not only gives an account that he had finiſhed what was hitherto required or fore propheſied, but by this teſtament he gives a comfortable account of his immediatly enſuing death alſo. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. 3. Death, and no leſſe then death, is the wages of ſinne: Therefore, after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſufferings, our ſurety behooved alſo to <hi>give up the ghoſt,</hi> to finiſh his work. 4 Chriſt, by undergoing bodily death for his people, hath hereby purchaſed that however they muſt die, yet death is no puniſhment of ſin to them; for, his ſuffering of death hath taken that ſting out of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Followeth the third part of the Chapter, containing two conſequents following upon his death. The firſt whereof (to <hi>v.</hi> 38.) contains ſome paſſages tending to the confirmation of this truth, that he was really dead, and to clear the accompliſhment of ſome further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning him; In which, the Jewes, the Souldiers, and <hi>John,</hi> do each of them act their part.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe we have the Jewes part in clearing up this truth, and making way for the accompliſhment of theſe predictions. They deſire <hi>Pilate</hi> (who had power of the bodies of condemned men) to have the bodies of theſe now crucified taken away from the croſſe and buried; and leſt, by this deſire, they ſhould ſeem to encline to the ſparing of their lives, they propound that their legs may be broken to haſten their death, that ſo they might be removed. The reaſon of which deſire, was, that, ſeeing according to the law, the land was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with theſe who were hanged, (eſpecially if not timeouſly buried) <hi>Deut</hi> 21.22, 23. They judged more eſpecially, that their continuance on the croſſe on that high Sabbath, (when the ordinary Sabbath, and the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre together, as is mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed on <hi>John</hi> 13.2.) might pollute them and their feaſt: And therefore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their preparations and eating the paſſeover that night, they would have it ſpeedily done. And this deſire, and the granting thereof by <hi>Pilate,</hi> did make way for that which followeth. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Chriſt our Lord was content to be made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and to bear the curſe, that it might not be ours. He was looked upon as one who would defile all things, that he might expiate our peſtiferous and infectious diſpoſitions: And, he ſubmitted to be accounted a polluter of their ſolemn feaſts in his ſuffering, that ſo he might expiate our being ſpots in the feaſts of charity, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 12. So much may we gather from his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, and the Jewes eſteem of him, that his body (among the reſt) might <hi>not remain upon the croſſe on the Sabbath day.</hi> 2. It is a commendable care in all the members of the viſible Church, to endeavour that curſes or accurſed things abide not upon their land, or, that it be not defiled by others; for, ſo much doth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity of this law, upon which they found their deſire, point out in the general; And though the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be ceaſed, yet the ſubſtance remaineth, providing it be rightly applied in particular caſes. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 6, 7. 3. The Lord can make uſe, even of bloody enemies, to do ſervice to his ſuffering people as they need, whatever their intentions and deſignes be; for, Chriſt now hanging on the croſſe, with ignominy, and as a curſe, his very enemies are conſulting and careful to have him taken out of that condition, and that <hi>the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſſe,</hi> though they intend him no courteſie in ſo doing, but do it only upon other grounds; yea, they deviſe to put him to further pain, and that <hi>his legs might be broken.</hi> 4. God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth ſo by his providence, as he will prevent any cruel purpoſes of his enemies, which might make void his purpoſes concerning his own; Therefore, it is ſaid, <hi>Therefore the Jewes beſought Pilate,</hi> &amp;c. which doth not import any connexion with the former purpoſe concerning his death, as if they had known of it, but that God keept them off from any ſuch purpoſe, till the time that he was dead, and ſo prevented the breaking of his bones, which would have made void a prediction. 5. Men, through formality and cuſtome, may be ſtrictly bound to performe the duties of ceremonial or external worſhip, whoſe conſciences, notwithſtanding, never ſcruple to violate the moſt weighty precepts of the law; for, they obſerve the ceremonial precept, <hi>that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſſe,</hi> and therefore, <hi>beſought Pilate that they might be taken away,</hi> and yet they ſcruple not to crucifie the Son of God, yea, and to uſe him with all rigour, and <hi>beſought that their legs might be broken.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14, 18. 6. It is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48148:203"/>
to the will of God, that ſpecial reſpect be had to the obſervation of the Sabbath, and that it be remembred and thought of aforehand, that we may prepare for it; for, this in general and in it ſelfe was commendable, that they ſo reſpect the ceremonial precept concerning theſe who were hanged, as they account it a ſpecial pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <hi>that their bodies ſhould remain upon the croſſe on the Sabbath:</hi> And their ceremonial obſervance of the <hi>preparation,</hi> (not only to the feaſt of the paſſeover, but to the ordinary Sabbath) may put us in minde that we ought to <hi>remember the Sabbath-day,</hi> that we may keep it holy. 7. The more ſolemnities, or conſiderations exciting us to ſerve God, do, in his providence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre at one time, the greater ſhould our care be to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that time, and to obſerve it according to the rule; for, ſo much may we learn from their care of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, upon this conſideration, that <hi>that Sabbath-day was an high day,</hi> for the reaſon formerly given. And albeit it was but from a tradition of their own (as hath been obſerved on <hi>John</hi> 13.2.) that two ſolemnities concurred at this time, yet when ever, in following Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sabbath and ſome extraordinary feaſt fell to be on one day, they did obſerve it the more ſolemnly, as their practice in this caſe maketh evident; and this ſhould point out our duty unto us.</p>

In all which the Lord had an over-ruling hand, to ſee to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of prophecies, as is after cleared. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. All things outward may come alike to all, and however men may be in different conditions before God, yet he may let their outward lot be equal; for, here, albeit (as the reſt obſerve) there was great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt theſe two, the one being penitent, and the other not, yet they are alike handled, <hi>they came and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which was crucified with him.</hi> 2. Albeit where the Lord pardons ſinne, there remains no ſatisfactory puniſhment, to be payed by the ſinner to juſtice; yet the Lord may ſee it fit to purſue pardoned men with rods, for their own exerciſe, and the inſtruction of others; for, albeit the one was pardoned, yet he not only ſuffered death, but his legs were broken. 3. Chriſt our Lord was not only nailed to the croſſe, but did really die and give up the ghoſt, to ſatisfie divine juſtice; for, of this the Souldiers were witneſſes, who <hi>when they came to Jeſus,</hi> they <hi>ſaw that he was dead already.</hi> And that he was ſo ſoon dead, before the other two, doth not only evidence that he, having death at his command, might die when he liſted, and when he had done his work; But alſo, that he had more upon him then any of them, and therefore was the ſooner diſpatched by death, and taken away as a priſoner. 4. No oppoſition will make void the purpoſes of God, but oppoſition and difficulties in the way of what he hath purpoſed, are let forth for this very end, that he may manifeſt the immutability of his counſel; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Jewes deſire, <hi>Pilates</hi> command, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers intentions, concurred to break his bones; And albeit there was great hazard that they ſhould execute it, having broken the legs of theſe on every ſide of him; nor was there any great ground to expect that theſe bloody ſouldiers would not exerce their cruelty upon him, though dead, (as they did in piercing of his ſide;) Yet ſeeing God had determined the contrary, they are impeded, <hi>they brake not his legs.</hi> 5. The Lord needs not miraculous waies and actings, whereby to fulfill his purpoſes; But he may bring about his eſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and purpoſes in a very common way, and in the ordinary actions of men; for, this purpoſe of God is fulfilled of their own free accord, upon a clear and rational ground; <hi>when they ſaw that he was dead alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they brake not his legs.</hi> 6. Albeit Chriſt over-ruled his enemies, that they ſhould not make void his purpoſes; Yet no cruelty was omitted toward Chriſt, dead or alive, which might teſtifie the great deſert of our ſins; nor was there any needful evidence wanting, which might make clear the truth of his death; for, <hi>But one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide,</hi> &amp;c. Albeit they were over-ruled that they ſhould not break his legs, yet they ceaſe not to exerciſe cruelty upon his dead body, and they put the truth of his death out of contraverſie. 7. That Chriſts ſide was thus pierced, may point out unto us, how deeply he was wounded for our ſins; and that, as his ſide was pierced, and a paſſage opened to his heart, ſo by his ſuffering we may look into his heart wounded with love to us, and pouring out it ſelfe for us; and, That as an hole was made in <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, to take out a wife, ſo a hole was made in his ſide, to take in his beloved bride to his heart. All this may we gather from this, that <hi>one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide.</hi> 8. That <hi>water and blood</hi> came out at this wound, it ſerveth not only to confirme that he was really dead, the ſpear piercing his heart, and drawing out the blood thereof, and the water that was about his heart to refreſh it: But it may further point out that it is he who <hi>came by water and blood,</hi> 1 John 5.6. and that from the merit and efficacy of his death, there floweth out <hi>water,</hi> to regenerate and waſh us from our uncleanneſſe, and <hi>blood,</hi> for obtaining remiſſion, and for ſprinkling and quieting of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, we have <hi>Johns</hi> part in this buſineſſe, who, 1. Bears witneſſe of the certainty of his death, and of the truth of theſe proceedings confirming the ſame, for confirmation of the faith of others, <hi>v.</hi> 35. 2. He clears theſe proceedings of the Souldiers, by comparing the ſame with Scripture, ſhewing how they were accompliſhed thereby. And particularly, that their not breaking his bones, was an accompliſhment of the truth of that type of the paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Num.</hi> 9.12. and that the promiſe made to all the godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.20. was eminently accompliſhed in him. And that their piercing of his ſide was agreeable to that prediction, <hi>Zecb.</hi> 12.10. wherein it is foretold that the Meſſiah was to be pierced, which is all that <hi>John</hi> points at here; though there it be further intimate, that <hi>they</hi> (or, the Jewes, of whom the Prophet is ſpeaking) <hi>pierced him,</hi> their malice and cruelty being the chief wheel that moved in this matter, and ſet <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the ſouldiers on work; and therefore the Jewes are ſaid to crucifie him by the Souldiers hands, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36 There is alſo further intimate in that prediction, a promiſe of the converſion of theſe who thus pierced him, the full accompliſhment whereof is yet to come; and this imports further, that he was not only pierced by their cruel perſecuting of him, but by and for their ſinnes alſo, as hath been cleared in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> is ſo careful to adde his teſtimony concerning theſe things, and particularly his death; Not only to ſtop the mouths of cavillers, who might be ready to alledge that he was taken away before he was dead: But further, yet again to teach us, that it is a point about which faith ought to be much employed, that Chriſt truely died for our ſins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. that ſo we may ſee that divine juſtice is truely ſatisfied for ſin, and may employ faith to get ſin truely ſlain and ſubdued, by the vertue of his death. 2. It is alſo firmly to be beleeved, that Chriſt and his followers are not in the hands of enemies, to be diſpoſed of as they pleaſe, but that God over-ruleth all of them, to bring about his purpoſes by them; for, this alſo was a part of <hi>Johns</hi> remark and teſtimony, not only that Chriſt died, but that the Souldiers did omit or exerciſe cruelty toward him (in not breaking his legs, and yet piercing his ſide) according as had been purpoſed by God, and foretold in Scripture; as is after cleared. 3. The doctrine of the Goſpel, concerning Chriſt, is a doctrine of faith; And it is to be aſſented to by faith, whoever there be to ſay to the contrary; for, his ſcope in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this, as of other Goſpel truths, is, <hi>that ye might beleeve.</hi> 4. As faith loveth not to walk on ſlippery and unſure grounds; So, the Word affordeth ſufficient ground of certainty for faith to faſten upon; for, <hi>John</hi> here declareth the certainty of this truth, <hi>that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> 5. It is a great confirmation of the certainty of the doctrine of the Goſpel, that the Penmen thereof were eye and ear witneſſes of what they publiſh; for, <hi>he that ſaw, bare record,</hi> &amp;c. See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. 6. Such as are made witneſſes of any thing concerning Chriſt, it is their duty, and will be their care (if they be affected therewith) to publiſh the ſame in their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the edification of others; for, ſo did <hi>John</hi> in his ſtation, <hi>And he that ſaw it, bare record, that ye might beleeve.</hi> 7. Whatever exceptions unbeleevers have againſt the doctrine of the Goſpel; Yet is ſufficient to condemne them, and to encourage beleevers, That the doctrine is true in it ſelfe, That the publiſhers were aſſured of the truth thereof, both by ſight and by faith; and, That they were ſo guided by God, as they would have been loath to publiſh any thing for a ground of faith, which was not a truth: All theſe are imported here, <hi>His record is true,</hi> in it ſelfe, <hi>and he knoweth that he ſaith true,</hi> not only in reſpect of his ſeeing what he ſaith, but by the Spirit of faith comparing what he ſaw, with the Scriptures, (as after followeth) <hi>and he knoweth that he ſaith true,</hi> and publiſheth only ſuch things as he is ſo perſwaded of, <hi>that ye might beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The only beſt way of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being edified by the paſſages of providences about Chriſt and his followers, is, to compare the ſame with Scripture; for, ſo doth <hi>John</hi> clear theſe paſſages, <hi>for theſe things were done, that the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled.</hi> 2. Such is our weakneſſe and inadvertency, that we need help to take up theſe Scriptures, which point out Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, and which ſerve to expound the lots he met with, and to confirme our faith concerning him and his ſufferings; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> help the Church in all ages, by pointing at <hi>the Scripture,</hi> which ſhould be <hi>fulfilled.</hi> 3. Chriſt is the truth and ſubſtance of that type of the Paſchal Lamb, and the true paſſeover ſacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. in whom, and in his ſufferings, all that is really to be found which is pointed out and typified by that ſhadow; Therefore, what was ordained concerning the Paſchal lamb, is applyed here to him, as the ſubſtance of that type, <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi> 4. Chriſt was not cruſhed by or under his ſufferings, but did ſubſiſt under all of it, till he triumphed over it; for, whatever was the reaſon of not breaking the bones of the lamb, (as, their great haſt in going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they might not ſtay to break the bones and eat the marrow) yet in the ſubſtance it pointed at this, that he was not broken under his ſuffering, but his bones were keeped whole, as being ſhortly to riſe again and triumph over it. And to this alſo may that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.20. be applied, which proveth true of beleevers under their trials, that they are not quite cruſhed by them, becauſe it was true of him firſt. 5. Chriſt and his followers are in the hand of God in their ſufferings, who carveth out the meaſure, weight, and every circumſtance of their trouble, and leaveth it not to the will of adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48148:204"/>
for, ſo much alſo doth that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. hold out, that God ſo keeps them as not ſo much as a bone is broken when he will have it otherwiſe; And this is true of Chriſt firſt, and of others through him. 6. Albeit Chriſt endured ſo much from men, as might put him to death; Yet he would have it ſeen that he died voluntarily, and that he was not violently compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to die; for, ſo much further doth the truth and ſubſtance of that type point out, <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken,</hi> He voluntarily prevented their cruelty, by yielding up the Ghoſt, ſo that they needed not violent him, nor haſten his death, as they did with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt is pointed out, not in one only, but in many of the writings of the Old Teſtament; And they need to ſtudy much in all the writings thereof, who would underſtand what is foretold of him, and compare the ſame with the accompliſhment, for their own edification: Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> make uſe yet of more Scripture, to clear theſe proceedings, <hi>And againe another Scripture ſaith.</hi> 2. All the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are divine and of alike infallible verity, ſo that one of them will prove true and be accompliſhed, no leſſe then another; for, in theſe proceedings, as one, ſo <hi>another Scripture</hi> is fulfilled and gets accompliſhment. 3. God in his providence hath determined and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt circumſtance and manner of the ſufferings of his people; for, ſo appears particularly in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, concerning whom it was forepropheſied that he ſhould be <hi>pierced,</hi> as the Souldiers did. 4. The Scripture is the true and infallible determiner, who are moſt guilty of perſecution in Gods account; And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, it will be found, that malicious upſtirrers unto cruelty, are more guilty then the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant executors thereof: Therefore doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſcribe this act to the Jewes, <hi>they pierced him,</hi> by the hand of the Souldiers, as either giving a particular command for this deed, or being generally guilty of all that followed upon their malicious perſecuting of him, and by their interpoſing with <hi>Pilate,</hi> v. 31. occaſioning this cruelty. 5. The Lord may be ſo gracious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, as to give them a ſight of their cruelty, in mercy, and a ſight of mercy together with it; for, ſo is this prediction held out in a promiſe of their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is cleared on <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond conſequent following upon Chriſts death, is his honourable burial, performed by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> (who belonged to that place <hi>Arimathea,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Ramah,</hi> or <hi>Ramathaim,</hi> but dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as appears by his Garden and grave in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.59, 60.) and <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> the firſt whereof begged his body of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and, (as the other Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi>) provided fine linnen, and the ſecond brought fine ſpices; and they jointly wound and embalmed his body after the Jewiſh manner, and do bury him in a new grave near the City, where they lay him with ſome haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Jewes preparation.</p>
                  <p>In all this procedure, we may conſider, firſt, that it behooved Chriſt not only to die, but to be buried, and lie a while in the grave, as the loweſt ſtate of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: Whereby, 1. He would have all yet further confirmed of the truth and certainty of his death, which is ſo neceſſary to be beleeved; Therefore is all this ſolemnity uſed, and <hi>Pilates</hi> doubting of his death, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.44. with other circumſtances, are ſo narrowly marked. 2. He would teach us, that ſin doth not only deſerve death, but that the ſinner alſo ſhould remain deaths priſoner; As he continued under the power thereof for a ſeaſon. 3. He would accompliſh what was foretold in the type of <hi>Jonah,</hi> Matth. 12.39, 40. and would point out that by his death and burial he hath appeaſed the wrath of God which was burning againſt his people, as upon <hi>Jonahs</hi> caſting into the ſea, it was calmed and ceaſed from raging againſt others. 4. He would publiſh his entire conqueſt over death, in that lie purſued it into its place, and there triumphed over it, by his Reſurrection, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. and would aſſure us that the grave can retain none of his followers longer then he pleaſeth, ſeeing he hath looſed and broken the bands thereof. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. 5. He would ſanctifie and perſume beleevers graves, and make that cold bed ſweet unto them, by his lying down there. 6. As his loweſt ſtep of his humiliation was his paſſage toward his glorious reſurrection; So he hath purchaſed unto his people, that their low abaſements ſhould tend to their higher exaltation. 7. He would alſo by this point out that vertue and efficacy which is in his death, extending to the very burial of ſinne, as he himſelfe was not only dead, but buried. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to conſider the perſons employed in this action, the one being deſcribed by the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts to be a rich man, and an honourable counſeller, and (as here alſo) a ſecret diſciple, or one of theſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. And the other being a Maſter and Teacher of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and deſcribed here rather from that timorous act,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48148:205"/>
                     <hi>ch.</hi> 22. then from his more bold (though not yet full) pleading on Chriſts behalfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.50, 51. This conſideration, and their owning Chriſt, in the general, may teach us. 1. A ſuffering Chriſt is nothing the leſſe precious in the eyes of a right diſcerner; for, here, he is thought worthy to be owned by theſe eminent men, and they run much hazard, and beſtow much coſt upon his burial. 2. Such as are taught to live contentedly under want, and are ready to ſuffer, and to be forſaken of all, when God calls them to it, may expect Gods remarkable care of them when they need it, and to get needful proofes thereof, after their trial is over; for, ſo is verified in Chriſts experience, who being content to become poor, and being now in his ſuffering left, even by his diſciples, yet he wants not honourable perſons (perfumed with the ſmell of his death) who beſtow expence upon his burial, Theſe who reſolve, on theſe terms, to follow God, may expect all things to be theirs, as they need them. 3. The Lord may have ſpecial favours to bring about for his people, not only when they are aſleep, (as <hi>Adam</hi> was when the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him a wife) but even when they are dead, and ſo altogether without them; As here alſo Chriſts experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth teach, who when he died, had neither winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet nor a place of burial provided; and yet both are provided for him in an honourable way. And though this was ſingular in Chriſt, that he lived ſtill as God, to provide what was needful for him; Yet in this alſo hath Gods love kithed toward many of his people, in his care of their poſterity after they were dead and gone. 4. There may be many friends to Chriſt, who for a long time may lurk through fear and weakneſſe; and yet they may (through Gods mercy to them) become more bold afterward; for, here, <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea being a diſciple of Jeſus, but ſecretly for fear of the Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus which at the firſt came to Jeſus by night,</hi> do now at laſt openly avow and own him. 5. Such may be the Lords mercy toward his own, as they may become more couragious in a time of great trial, then they have been in times of leſſe hazard; for, they who before were timorous and fearful to own Chriſt, do now in this great hazard, openly appear for him, the one going to <hi>Pilate,</hi> (and that <hi>boldly,</hi> as it is, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.43) and both of them openly concurring to bury him: Such courage did then ſpring up out of the aſhes of Chriſts death. And indeed, when God looſeth the bonds of faint-hearted friends, how eaſie will it be for them to come over all their former fears?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we are to conſider the particulars of their preparation before his burial, here mentioned, Namely, That <hi>Joſeph</hi> craves liberty of <hi>Pilate</hi> to take away his body, and obtains it, and takes down his body; That <hi>Nicodemus</hi> brought abundance of fine ſpices; and, That both together wound his body in linnen cloath, applying the ſpices after the Jewiſh cuſtome, which was not to unbowed the dead, and then to enbalme them, but only to apply the ſpices outwardly, and it is like that being in haſt here, they took not ſuch leiſure as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was uſual. Theſe particulars may teach us, 1. It is the will of God that zeal and affection run in a right channel, and keep his way, being (as pure, ſo) peaceable and orderly; for, <hi>Joſeph</hi> goeth firſt and ſought <hi>Pilates</hi> leave, who had power of the dead bodies, <hi>v.</hi> 31. and obtains it, before he do any thing. 2. It is the will of God, and very commendable, that the living do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme due honour to the dead bodies of Saints; And ſuch as have received mercy from Chriſt, will think no expence too much, were it even beſtowed on his dead body; for, <hi>a mixture of mirrhe and aloes, about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound weight,</hi> is employed this way, together alſo with fine linnen, as it is <hi>Mark</hi> 15.46. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.2. 3. It was beleeved, even in the Church of the Jewes, that there ſhould be a reſurrection of the ſame bodies which were dead; for, ſo much alſo did this practice of embalming among the Jewes, point at, (though the Heathen alſo borrowed it from the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> albeit they were ignorant of the reſurrection) <hi>they wound his body with linnen cloaths, with the ſpices,</hi> in expectation of the reſurrection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though, it may be, not beleeving that he ſhould riſe on the third day. Only ſeeing Chriſt hath now given a clear pledge of our Reſurrection, by his own riſing from the dead, there is no cauſe why that cuſtome ſhould be continued for that end.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Their burying of him in a new grave in a garden, (which was <hi>Joſephs</hi> own, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.60.) may teach, Not only that he would be buried in a garden, to expiate <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne in the garden, and that he was buried in another mans grave, who ſuffered for the ſins of others. But further. 1. It is mens duty to acquaint themſelves with the thoughts of mortality in time, that ſo they may be the more ready when death comes; Therefore had <hi>Joſeph</hi> his <hi>ſepulchre</hi> ready <hi>in the garden,</hi> daily before his eyes. 2. Selfe-denying affection unto Chriſt, will quit any thing to him, that he calls for or needs; for, <hi>Joſeph</hi> quits his grave to Chriſt. 3. All ſuſpition of any others riſing in ſtead of Chriſt, or of his riſing by the vertue of any other, was prevented by his being buried in <hi>a new ſepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid:</hi> And ſo none could riſe out of it, but he, nor could be raiſed by any vertue from any other buried there before him, as a man was raiſed at the touch of <hi>Eliſha's</hi> bones, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.21.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a reaſon is given why he was buried there; Namely, That being the preparation day, wherein they could not attend long, therefore they haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid him there, as being near at hand, and, belike alſo, they did not, by reaſon of this, attend upon all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances required in embalming of him. This may teach, 1. Albeit ceremonial performances give place unto moral duties, and men may lawfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the one, when they come in competition with the other; Yet men ought ſo to follow the one, as they ſtrive (ſo far as is poſſible) to overtake all: Therefore, they ſo go about the burying of Chriſt, as they make all the haſt they can, to obſerve <hi>the Jewes preparation day.</hi> 2. When the Lord doth not let things frame with his people as they would, it doth oft-times prove to be ſo, becauſe they ſhall not need what he is not pleaſed to give; for, they got not leaſure to wait upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but haſtily laid him in that ſepulchre, <hi>for it was nigh at hand,</hi> becauſe he was not to need a grave long, nor to need that way of embalming which they would have uſed toward him. 3. The Lord alſo did ſo order, that every paſſage about Chriſts burial, and even theſe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48148:205"/>
which his friends would have had done otherwiſe, did contribute to his great ſcope of glorifying Chriſt; for, therefore alſo was it ordered, that they being haſtened, laid him in the ſepulchre, which was <hi>nigh at hand,</hi> that ſo he might riſe in the view of all his enemies, where they had the ſtone ſealed, and a guard to keep him in; whereas, had he been carried further off, the matter had been more obſcure, and might have ſeemed more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And thus alſo doth he bring about his glory, by that wherein his people could little expect it ſhould be ſo.</p>

               <p>In handling this begun exaltation of Chriſt, I ſhall (as formerly) ſpeak only to what is recorded by <hi>John,</hi> ſave in ſo far as may be needful for clearing the greateſt contrarieties which ſeem to be betwixt him and the reſt.

                  <p>In this verſe is recorded how <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early to the ſepulchre, on the firſt day of the week, purpoſing to ſee the ſepulchre, and anoint the body of Jeſus, (as is obſerved by the reſt) ſhe findes the ſtone rolled away, and (as appears from her report, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and is recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.2, 3.) findes alſo the grave em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty. Albeit the other Evangeliſts do declare that there were other women beſide, who went to the grave, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one or two companies, I will not determine) yet ſhe is only named here, as being moſt famous in this Hiſtory; for her affection, zeal and activity, and one who acts an eminent part in the ſubſequent paſſages. And as for Chriſts mother who ſtayed ſo ſtoutly by the Croſſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.25. albeit <hi>John</hi> had taken charge of her, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.27. we are not to ſuppoſe that ſhe was yet retired from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ſhe was ſtill there as well as <hi>John, v.</hi> 2. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. and yet we do not finde her ſtirring with this, or any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, about his grave. I ſhall forbear to determine, whether ſhe came not to anoint him, as beleeving his Reſurrection, (as faith will hold out in much needleſs anxiety and toile, though yet Chriſt made good uſe of their weakneſſe;) or, whether her great grief did ſo far ſurpaſſe that of the reſt, as ſhe could not be ſo active as they: as the greatneſſe of grief or love will readily obſtruct the expreſſions thereof: But it is greateſt ſobriety to leave the enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y of theſe things which God hath concealed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Affection may ſhine very eminently in weak inſtruments, and greateſt ſervices are ordinarily done by weak things, or theſe things wherein we moſt abaſe our ſelves; for, here weak women, and <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> among them, are on foot early, and ready to performe ſuch ſervice as they thought moſt ſuteable unto Chriſt, when the diſciples have not yet appeared. 2. Great things received in mercy from Chriſt, will ſhine forth in great activity for him in mens ſtations, and according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of light they have received; for, therefore is <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> only named here, becauſe of her activity and eminency, being eminently engaged to Chriſt who had caſt ſeven devils out of her. And albeit ſhe was weak in her undertakings, yet that ought not to obſcure her affection. 3. True affection toward
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48148:206"/>
Chriſt will not cool through length of time, nor will it be quenched by impediments caſt in the way. But will wait on and burn the brighter, when it gets oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; for, her affection being kept up from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe, by reaſon of the Jewiſh Sabbath, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.56. it doth not extinguiſh; but on the third day appeareth, and that <hi>early, when it was yet dark.</hi> They ſet out at that time, though it was toward Sun-riſing when they came to the ſepulchre, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.2. 4. As it is moſt agreeable to Scripture-Rules to begin the Sabbath in the morning; ſo it doth begin early, and we ought to conſider upon this, that we may begin early to the work of ſanctifying thereof; for, this time of their coming out is called, <hi>the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the firſt day of the week,</hi> Mat. 28.1. to intimate, that then the Jewiſh Sabbath end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the firſt day of the week, or Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, began; and albeit they ſet out <hi>the firſt day of the week early, when it was yet dark,</hi> yet Chriſt (who roſe upon that, being the third day,) was riſen before they came, and ſo the Chriſtian Sabbath was begun. To which, if we adde the long continuance of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſervice, (as hath been the practice of affection at ſome times, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. we may gather uſeful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for our ſanctifying thereof. 5. Chriſt is oft-times ſought where he is not to be found, even by thoſe who have much affection to him; for, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to finde him in his grave, and anoint him there, and ſhe <hi>ſeeth the ſtone taken away from the ſepulchre,</hi> (the Angel having rolled it away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2. not becauſe Chriſt needed that help, but to teſtifie Angels attendance upon our exalted Lord) and findeth that he is not in the grave. Her unbelief, though joyned with affection, did ſpeak but poorly of Chriſt, in that ſhe came to ſeek him in his grave, who was among the living; And thus not only do they miſſe him who ſeek him in dead and unapproven Ceremonies and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in a dead formal way; but even his own, when they ſeek him in a dead diſcouraged way under difficulties, as if he were dead and would not do for them. 6. That this is in particular marked, that <hi>ſhe ſeeth the ſtone taken away, &amp;c.</hi> which was the great difficulty they were thinking upon by the way, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.3, 4, it may ſerve to teach; partly, that difficulties may appear very great, which yet the Lords Providence may make very eaſie, as appeareth in the matter of removing this ſtone to their hand; and partly, that ſo long as we continue in unbeliefe, and in our miſtakes of Chriſt, the change of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or removal of apprehended difficulties, will not ſerve our turn, but will rather beget new ſorrows and doubts; for, their thought was, that if the ſtone were taken away, they ſhould finde Chriſt, and now it is taken away, to diſcover that they are further from finding him in their way. 7. Whatever diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments affectionate Saints meet with, by reaſon of their weakneſſe, they will finde in end that all of theſe tend to their advantage; for, ſuch was the iſſue of her diſappointment here, though it bred preſent ſolicitude, yet in the end ſhe found that ſhe was diſappointed of a dead Chriſt, that ſhe might finde him living. 8. In this Narration, this great Article of our faith is here ſuppoſed, that Chriſt is riſen from the dead; which beleevers ought to feed upon, approving him to be true God, who roſe again by his own power, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.4. as proving the Juſtification of all theſe who flee to him, (ſeeing as in his death he laid down the price, ſo in his Reſurrection he got a diſcharge in our name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. and ſo will appear the ſecond time as our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged Surety, without ſin, to our ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28) as affording matter of gloriation to Saints, againſt all the challenges of ſin and the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. as confirming and aſſuring the renovation &amp; ſanctification of all theſe who ſeek to be partakers of his Reſurrection, as to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of mortification by the efficacy of his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 6. <hi>Phil</hi> 3.10. And, as aſſuring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers of their Reſurrection and future glory, ſeeing our Head will draw all his members after him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 55, 56, 57. This great truth is here preached unto <hi>Mary, by the ſtone taken away from the ſepulchre,</hi> though as yet ſhe ſaw not ſo much in it. 9. As this great truth of the Reſurrection it ſelf, ſo alſo the way and circumſtances thereof are to be ſtudied and pondered for our uſe; Therefore here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where are theſe ſo narrowly marked: And in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we may remark here, 1. That he roſe without obſervation and witneſſes; for, albeit ſeveral felt that earth-quake, and the watch and the women ſaw that Angel which deſcended at his Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2, 3, 4, 5. yet it appears not that any of the watch ſaw him riſe, and thoſe women who came firſt, finde the ſepulchre empty; nor afterward did he appear openly to all, whereby he might have prevented that report which was ſpread abroad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. but only to his diſciples and brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. And did leave this truth to be beleeved from the Word, holding out theſe evidences and apparitions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. hereby teaching, That however Chriſt did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably witneſſe the truth of his glory and exaltation, yet he will rather have it the object of our faith then of our ſenſe, while we are within time. 2. That he roſe on the third day, and that very early, having lien only one whole day and night, (which was their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) and but a part of the firſt day, which was their preparation; and now on the third, being <hi>the firſt day of the week early, when it was yet dark</hi> he riſeth again. Hereby not only did he fulfil the type of <hi>Jonah, Mat</hi> 12.40. but did alſo prove both that he was really dead, and yet that he felt no corruption (according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.10. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31. and 13.35, 36, 37.) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lien ſo ſhort while in the grave: &amp; more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he haſted through his ſufferings to his glory, that he might make way for, and give a pledge of our ſpeedy outgates, as we need them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. 3. That he roſe on <hi>the firſt day of the week,</hi> that he might perfect the work of Redemption, and the new Creation, on the day when the firſt Creation began, and might ſanctifie and ſet apart that day to be the Chriſtian Sabbath, which therefore is called <hi>the Lords day,</hi> Rev. 1.10. and was the day of ſome of his ſolemn appearings to his diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and 26. of this Chapter, and the day obſerved by the Church for ſolemn meetings and worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 4. That the firſt evidences of his Reſurrection were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and ſuch as at firſt did increaſe their feares and perplexities, or, at moſt, but beget aſtoniſhment; for, all that <hi>Mary</hi> ſeeth is but the ſtone taken away and the empty ſepulchre, which augments her ſorrow; The

Albeit all the diſciples were preſent when <hi>Mary</hi> with the reſt of the women made their report, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.9, 10. yet it is ſaid here only, that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> becauſe they only made any uſe of her report. For the reſt accounted them but idle tales, and beleeved not, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.11. and albeit neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>John</hi> beleeved as yet (as appeareth from <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. with <hi>Luke</hi> 24.12,) yet they will go and be further informed. Conſider, 2. The greater difficulty here is, How <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is ſaid to report only that Chriſt was taken out of the grave, and yet it appeareth from, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.5, 6, 7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. that Angels had told them he was riſen, and it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.9, 10. that <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> was amongſt theſe who told the Angels tidings: This difficulty may be cleared two wayes. 1 That <hi>Mary</hi> coming with the firſt to ſee the ſepulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1. and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it empty, ſhe ran away with the ſad newes, before the Angels told theſe tydings to the reſt, and where it is ſaid, ſhe with the reſt, <hi>told theſe things, Luke</hi> 24.10. it may be thus expounded, that every one of them told their own part, <hi>Mary</hi> told of the empty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and the reſt of the women, (who came after her, and before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ran to the ſepulchre) told that they had ſeen Angels, and what they had heard from them. 2 It may, with as little violence to the text, be cleared thus, That indeed they told the Angels meſſage, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.22, 23. but ſo as they did not beleeve it, and they told alſo what is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as their own ſenſe of the matter, whatever An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſaid to the contrary. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duty of Saints, when they are in any diſtreſſe, eſpecially concerning Chriſt, to repair unto the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of his diſciples, and communicate their caſe with them, whatever be the ſucceſſe; for, whatever was <hi>Maries</hi> weakneſſe, yet it is commendable that ſhe goeth and acquainteth the diſciples with her ſad caſe. 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto Chriſt, will make ſuch as miſſe him, very active in communicating their loſſes, though oft-times ſuch haſte, joyned with unbelief, doth cauſe them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move but little; for, therefore is it marked, that <hi>ſhe runneth and cometh</hi> to the diſciples, out of her affection, though her unbelief made it be to little purpoſe. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, all who get any tidings concerning Chriſt, are bound to make uſe thereof; and it will be marked as their fault when they do not ſo, yet in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, theſe only may be ſaid to be preſent and ſpoken to, who make uſe of any ſuch tidings; and for others, what is ſpoken, may be ſaid to be in vain to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8. For this cauſe it is ſaid here only, that <hi>ſhe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to Simon Peter, and to the other diſciple whom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus loved,</hi> becauſe they made ſome uſe of her newes, as hath been cleared. It is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.24 that <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them which were with the diſciples, went to the ſepulchre,</hi> not that they were ſent, by common conſent, but they went of their own accord. 4. Such as do ſlide in an houre of tentation, ought not to lie ſtill, but recover themſelves by repentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4, 5. and being recovered, they ought to return to the ſociety of the Lords people, to keep communion with them, and to run one hazard with them; therefore we finde <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> who had repented before, returned unto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples again. 5. As back-ſliders ſhould be encouraged to return, conſidering that they have the Churches affection ready to receive them again, and confirme their love toward them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. (as here <hi>Simon Peter</hi> is admitted amongſt them) ſo, the more any have taſted themſelves of the love of Chriſt, they will be the more ready, with tenderneſſe, to welcome back-ſliders, and ſuch as do come in: Therefore it is ſpecially marked, that <hi>Simon Peter, and the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> were together, and afterward they keep together. A man ſo qualified as <hi>John,</hi> was a fit man to receive and welcome a penitent <hi>Peter.</hi> And thus alſo <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the Son of conſolation, did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.26, 27, 28. and 11.25, 26. And thus will theſe, who are indeed ſpiritual, deal with ſuch as have fallen, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. 6. Unbelief, though joyned with affection, may miſtake Gods dealing ſo far, as not only to look upon real mercies as trials, but to point out ſuppoſed trials in the blackeſt colours, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcourage a whole meeting of diſciples) and as ſadder then their real afflictions; yea, the more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there be, unbelief may abuſe it, to render their apprehenſions yet ſadder; for, affectionate <hi>Mary</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this great mercy of Chriſts Reſurrection, as ſadder then the death and burial of Chriſt; for then, though he was dead and buried, yet ſhe knew where to finde him, to tender her reſpects to his dead body; but now, ſaith ſhe, <hi>They</hi> (either ſome friends out of their reſpects, or his foes, or ſome others. See <hi>v.</hi> 15.) <hi>have taken away the Lord out of the ſepulchre, and we</hi> (I, nor any of the women who were with me) <hi>know not where they have laid him.</hi> 7. It is ſad to affectionate ſoules, when Chriſt is away from them, but much ſadder, when they know not where to ſeek or finde him; and this doth uſually follow on the other; for, both theſe concurred in <hi>Maries</hi> trial, in this particular way of finding Chriſt here: <hi>They have taken away the Lord, &amp;c. and we know

And may point out their tolerable condition unto them, who though they want, yet they know what to do, and how to come ſpeed. 8. Such is the power of unbelief and tentation, that even real encouragements will beget and feed diſcouragement and fear; for, the empty grave, which ſhould have comforted her, occaſions all this miſtake and ſorrow; <hi>They have taken away the Lord out of the ſepulchre.</hi> 9 Unbelief alſo is ſo powerful, and Gods wonderful actings do oft-times ſo overcome our weak faith, that even an Angel from heaven will not prevail to perſwade us of them, till the Lord come; for, albeit (as hath been cleared) Angels had told her, and the reſt, of Chriſts Reſurrection, yet ſhe inſiſts on this as her real thought of the buſineſſe, <hi>They have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> A lie is far more eaſily beleeved then truth, in an houre of tentation; and ſhe credits her own heart and ſenſe better then an Angels teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. 10. Whoever look upon Gods dealing, and the paſſages they meet with, without the Word, they will readily miſtake, and feed their own tentations; for, whereas the Angels had remitted them to Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to clear this paſſage, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.6, 7. the looks only to the empty grave, and judgeth according to her ſenſe: <hi>They have taken away the Lord out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</hi> 11. In all this regrate, ſhe calls him <hi>the Lord,</hi> a title proper to him in a peculiar ſenſe, and which ſhe uttered in another ſenſe here; then when ſhe gave that title to him, when ſhe ſuppoſed him to be the Gardiner, <hi>v.</hi> 15. It doth not only point out her great reſpect to him, when dead and gone, as ſhe ſuppoſed; and that indeed he was <hi>the Lord</hi> ſtill, even when dead, as ſhe ſuppoſeth him now to be. But further, this title, as it is proper to him in a peculiar ſenſe, (and ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſo) doth contain a refutation of all her miſtakes; for, his being <hi>the Lord,</hi> and that even when dead in her account, doth evince that he was not to be detained a priſoner by death, but was now riſen, the time prefixed by him, for his continuance in the grave, being expired; And ſo it may teach, 1. Even in the greateſt fits of Saints unbelief, a right diſcerner may yet reade ſome faith; as may be gathered to be in <hi>Mary</hi> from this compellation. So in the Churches complaint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>my Lord,</hi> is not only the language of affection, regrating that ſuch a one had <hi>forgotten</hi> her, but the language of faith alſo, cleaving to an intereſt in him, though ſhe diſcern it not, being over-powred with ſenſe, which ſaith he had forgotten her. 2. What Saints do ſometime beleeve in the midſt of their tentations, if it were enlarged as it ought, would refute all their unbelief; for, as her acknowledging him <hi>the Lord,</hi> doth refute her preſent diffidence and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; ſo when Saints beleeve an intereſt in God, and that he is theirs, when yet they are plunged in perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about many particulars; His being their God is ſufficient to give them comfortable ground of hope in all theſe.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular in this Narration, is, the uſe which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> make of this information, and that they went to the ſepulchre to ſee. Which being generally propounded, <hi>v</hi> 3. is more particularly ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 4. that they both ran toward the ſepulchre, and that <hi>John</hi> being more young and vigorous then <hi>Peter,</hi> did out-ſtrip him in running. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When Saints finde any intimation that Chriſt is a miſſing, they ſhould take with the alarme, and it is their duty to be ſtir themſelves to ſeek a good account of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; for, albeit there was much unbelief here, yet it was commendable, that when they heard the newes, they <hi>went forth, and came to the ſepulchre,</hi> to ſee what newes they could get. 2. Such as have freſh ſenſe of their own frailty, and of Chriſts love, will be moſt active to enquire after an abſent and miſſed Chriſt; for, it is <hi>Peter</hi> new recovered, <hi>and that other diſciple,</hi> who <hi>went forth, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Such as have fallen foully, ought not only to recover by repentance, and joyne themſelves with the ſociety of Saints; but they ought to evidence their recovery, by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and being with the firſt in teſtimonies of affection; for, ſo appeareth in <hi>Peter,</hi> who now being recovered, is with the firſt of the diſciples, who go to ſearch after Chriſt. And it may be that therefore <hi>Peter</hi> only is named in this undertaking, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.12. becauſe the fallen mans diligence and recovery was ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. 4. Diligence is required, and is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable teſtimony of affection, in diſciples enquiry, and making ſearch after Chriſt; for, <hi>they ran both together.</hi> 5. Albeit affection will put beleevers to all the diligence they can, yet every one is not to be tried by anothers meaſure of expreſſing his affection; for, one may be as affectionate as another, who yet may be retarded, and come ſhort in expreſſion of what that other attaineth unto; for, ſo appeareth in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, they ran both together,</hi> but <hi>the other diſciple did out-run Peter, and came firſt to the ſepulchre: John</hi> being young, and of a nimble body, did out-run <hi>Peter,</hi> who yet loved Chriſt as well as he, and was running as faſt as he could. And thus alſo may many be borne down in their activity in reſpect of others, by reaſon of their infirmity of body, tentations of minde, or other infirmities, whoſe affections, notwithſtanding, are as fervent toward Chriſt.</p>

That <hi>Peter</hi> coming after, went into the grave, and obſerved more diſtinctly the order how theſe linnens lay, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. and, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Peters</hi> example, went alſo in, and ſaw and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame more diſtinctly alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 8. — Unto this <hi>John</hi> ſubjoynes an account of the effect this ſight had upon him, that it perſwaded him to beleeve, <hi>v.</hi>—8. which he amplifieth from an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their common evil of not taking up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the Scriptures, which ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Concerning this beleeving of <hi>John,</hi> and his acknowledgement thereupon, of their ignorance and unbelief of the Scriptures. Conſider, 1. Albeit by ſome it be conceived that he beleeved no more then what the women had told, that Chriſts body was taken away, and that becauſe they knew not the Scriptures as yet, therefore he could beleeve no more; and albeit ſo much only be recorded as the general account of their diligence, when they returned from the grave, or, at leaſt the hearers underſtood it ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.24. yet this being recorded particularly of <hi>John,</hi> it ſeems more probable, that upon this ſight he did beleeve his Reſurrection, and that it was true which the Angels had ſaid to the women, though it was but in ſome weak meaſure, and it may be he was as eaſily ſhaken again. Nor is it needful to debate, whether their not believing upon <hi>Maries</hi> report that ſhe had ſeen Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16 9.10, 11. (which was after this, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>v.</hi> 18.) was true only of the body of them, <hi>John</hi> being excepted, or whether he ſtaggered again. Only this is beyond all contraverſie, that both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> (who went alſo with them, as appeares, <hi>v.</hi> 11) did beleeve ſo much as that his body was taken away: and therefore it needed not be remarked as any thing ſingular in him, that he beleeved ſo much. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, this interpretation helps us to put a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all theſe three who were now at the ſepulchre; <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe believes no more then ſhe did, and therefore ſtayeth ſtill about the grave, till ſhe got a ſight of Chriſt to comfort her, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>Peter,</hi> though it ſeems he goeth a further length; yet he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but only wondereth, and is aſtoniſhed at theſe things, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.12. and gets a ſight of Chriſt before the reſt of the diſciples, to clear and confirme him, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.34. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. But <hi>John</hi> doth here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and therefore needs no ſuch particular confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, till afterward that he getteth it with the reſt. Conſider, 2. This amplification and reaſon ſubjoined, <hi>v.</hi> 9. albeit, being applied generally to all, or the moſt part of them who were there, (as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expreſſed) it is true, they did not beleeve his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but only that he was taken away, or did wonder and were confounded with what they ſaw, and that becauſe they did not, even then, conſider nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Scriptures. But applying it particularly to <hi>John,</hi> it holds thus true of him, that he did believe only when he ſaw, and not before, becauſe he had not heeded nor believed the Scripture, ſpeaking of Chriſts Reſurrection, till he ſaw this accompliſhment. Whereas had he beleeved the Scripture, he might have been aſſured of this before he ſaw theſe things. And ſo <hi>John,</hi> when he gets faith, acknowledgeth his fault, recording it in this Narration, and acknowledgeth it was a common fault among them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There were ſuch clear evidences to be ſeen about Chriſts grave, as made it apparent that he was indeed riſen from the dead, and was not conveighed away, neither by friends nor foes, nor any other for their own ends; for, the <hi>lying of the linnen cloathes,</hi> ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ved by both of them, did clearly witneſſe this. Beſide, that it would have been a terrour to have handled a naked dead man; what could be the end of any party to carry away his body, and leave theſe? It is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that any friends, (could they have had acceſſe to him through the guards) would have ſo handled his bleſſed body, as to carry it away naked; nor could it have agreed with their deſigne, to carry him away by ſtealth, to take leiſure to ſtrip him. And as for his foes, or others, it is to be ſuppoſed they would rather have had the fine linnen and the ſpices then his body; and ſo would never have left theſe behind, when they carried it away; yea, the orderly lying of the linnens, and that not ſo much as a napkin was away, but orderly wrapped and laid up, (as is remarked by <hi>Peter, v.</hi> 7.) doth evidence that this was not done in haſte nor confuſion. 2. That Chriſt riſing from the dead, left his grave-cloathes behinde him, (which yet were all the cloathes he had, the ſouldiers having part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his garments) whereas <hi>Lazarus</hi> came out with his grave-cloathes, <hi>John</hi> 11.44. It may ſerve to teach us, not only what he hath purchaſed to us by his death and Reſurrection, even a reſtitution to that bleſſed eſtate through him wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocency, (when he needed no garments) though the compleat enjoyment thereof be ſuſpended till eternity, wherein we ſhall be perfected, and ſhall not only need nothing to cover our outward nakedneſſe, but ſhall leave that infirmity and corruption, which accompanieth us to the grave, behinde us, as he left his grave-cloathes. But further, it teacheth, That Chriſt roſe again not to live any more in this world, nor to die any more, but to live and reign for ever: and therefore he left his grave-cloathes, whereas with <hi>Lazarus</hi> it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he being to live in the world for a ſpace, and then to die again. 3. A little ſtand in any good courſe
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48148:209"/>
may put a man behinde even thoſe who otherwiſe were behinde him; for, <hi>John</hi> out-ran <hi>Peter</hi> in coming to the grave, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and yet ſtanding a little at the grave, <hi>Peter,</hi> who was behinde, doth get before him, and gets a more diſtinct ſight. 4. A ſincere and conſtant follower of his duty, though ſlow, may at laſt attain to caſt a copy to theſe who are more forward; for, <hi>Peter,</hi> though ſlow, yet holding on, attains to caſt <hi>John</hi> a copy who came before him. 5. A ſincerely forward man is ſo humble, as to be content to learn a leſſon, even from one who hath ſometime fallen foully, and who even now was behinde him; for, <hi>John</hi> learns this leſſon from <hi>Peters</hi> example, and <hi>went in alſo and ſaw.</hi> 6. The Lords way of working with his own is divers, and he may gift faith to one of his own, when yet another, having the ſame means, is left under the power of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief for a time; for, <hi>he ſaw, and beleeved,</hi> which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> as yet did not. 7. Faith is ſo far above the reach of nature, that it is hard to endure, even Saints, to beleeve, when they want ſatisfaction to their ſenſe; for, <hi>he ſaw and beleeved,</hi> and not till he ſaw. 8. It is our great fault, and the fruit of much ignorance, peeviſhneſſe, and averſeneſſe from the way of faith, that plain Scriptures, which might comfort us, lye beſide us unobſerved, or not beleeved and truſted; for, ſo much doth <hi>Johns</hi> acknowledgement import, when <hi>he ſaw and beleeved,</hi> and ſo got inſight in, and gave credit to the Scriptures, he acknowledgeth that <hi>as yet,</hi> or before this, he had <hi>not known the Scripture;</hi> Not that he could be ſimply ignorant, of what Chriſt had ſo often told, and the Angel had even now ſent them word of by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but that he had not heeded, or pondered and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. 9. When the Lord condeſcends to give us ſenſible ſatisfaction, for the help of our faith, it is our duty not to reſt upon ſuch a way, and alwaies to ſuſpend our beleeving, till we get the like again; But we ought rather to look on it as a reproofe for our not ſtudying or heeding, and not beleeving naked truth, and accordingly ſhould humhle our ſelves, and acknowledge our fault: Therefore <hi>John,</hi> getting this ſight, acknowledgeth his fault, that he did not before beleeve, <hi>for as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he muſt riſe again from the dead.</hi> They did not heed and ponder theſe things which were revealed in the Word, ſo as to feed upon them by faith. 10. Any evil, and particularly, the evil of ignorance or not believing the Scripture, is the more odious and grievous to a godly man, the more it be common and frequent; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> bring out this reaſon and acknowledgement in general, <hi>they knew not the Scripture,</hi> not ſo much to give reaſon why the other two beleeved not as yet, far leſſe to extenuate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to aggravate this fault which he found in himſelf, when he perceiveth it ſo common, and ſo ſad fruits of it yet in the reſt. 11. The children of God may be much in the dark, and much over-powered with unbelief, by reaſon of their ignorance and in an houre of tentation, who yet are not to be caſt off, nor is it to be deſpaired but they will recover themſelves; Therefore <hi>John</hi> only ſaith, <hi>as yet they knew not the Scripture,</hi> which yet afterward they did, and it ſeemes he himſelf now attained to know it in part.</p>

When diſciples have got ſome clearing in dark caſes, they may yet be kept under great irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oo and incertainty, by reaſon of their ignorance, and for their trial and exerciſe, till Chriſt do clear and confirme them yet more: As here, <hi>John</hi> beleeving in ſome meaſure upon what he ſaw, and <hi>Peter</hi> wondring in himſelf, they know not what to do next, but <hi>went away again to their own home.</hi>

Albeit there are, oft-times, many errours in the way of affectionate Saints, yet thoſe whom Chriſt is to manifeſt himſelf moſt and firſt unto, are ſuch as cannot want him, but muſt inceſſantly wait on till they get him; for, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the diſciples practice, <hi>v</hi> 10. it is ſubjoyned, <hi>But Mary ſtood without at the ſepulchre.</hi> Not only might ſhe ſtay there with leſſe hazard then the men; but when their irreſolution and fear ſent them away, her affection (though over-powered with more unbelief then any of them had) keeps her ſtill waiting on, and ſo, though her failings were many, ſhe gets the firſt ſight of Chriſt. 2. Albeit affectionate Saints may have much cauſeleſſe ſorrow about Chriſt; yet want, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real, or apprehended only, which yet is real to the apprehender) ſhould be evidenced by ſome expreſſions of affection, witneſſing their reſpect to what they want: for, it was in it ſelfe commendable, that ſhe <hi>ſtood weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

for a ſuppoſed dead and loſt Chriſt, though it was her miſtake to think ſo. 3.

                  <p>The ſecond particular in this Narration, is, her ſeeing of two Angels in the ſepulchre, and their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with her. Theſe appearing in ſplendent white rayment, do queſtion her concerning the cauſe of her ſorrow, and ſhe returns an account of her caſe in the ſame terms, as ſhe had done to the diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is the Lords reſpect toward affectionate mourners after Chriſt, as they ſhall not want needful comfort, albeit Angels ſhould be ſent with the meſſage; for, diſtreſſed <hi>Mary ſeeth two Angels,</hi> ſent with an uſeful meſſage to her. 2. Their appearing in <hi>white</hi> ſerved to point out their ſpotleſſe purity who are Gods conſtant attenders, and to hold out what they ſhould aime at, who look to dwell with God for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 14. and what in end they will be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.13. 3. Their poſture, <hi>ſitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jeſus had layen,</hi> ſerved not only to confirme that he was not taken away, but had indeed riſen, ſeeing they appear in and at his grave, and ſo he could not be ſtill dead whom they ſerve: But further, it pointed out, That it is through Chriſt alone, and by vertue of his death and ſufferings, that God is reconciled to ſinners, and they have acceſſe unto him upon a Mercy-ſeat: for, therefore do they <hi>fit at the head and feet, where the body of Jeſus had layen,</hi> as the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, ſate upon either end of the Mercy-ſeat, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence what his death and burial had procured unto ſinners. 4. The caſe of ſuch as are indeed ſeeking Chriſt, is ſo ſweet and ſure, that their heartleſſe and dejected ſorrow is cauſeleſſe (even themſelves, when they are in their right wits, being Judges) and worthy of reprehenſion and challenge; Therefore are they ſent with this commiſſion unto her, <hi>Woman why weepeſt thou?</hi> which is a ſpeech full of comfort, intimating that ſhe had no cauſe to weep, yet ſeaſoned with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe that ſhe ſhould weep ſo heartleſſely; and her ſelfe is put to judge (when ſhe is in a right frame) of the truth and juſtneſſe of this challenge. And indeed, it is but our low ſtature who cannot ſee a far off, which is the great cauſe of our anxiety; whereas their queſtion imports, that were ſhe elevate as they were, to ſee the truth of the matter, ſhe would not be diffidently anxious. 5. The want of Chriſt is matter of ſorrow indeed to a lover of him. The ſorrow and joy of an affectionate Saint are chiefly taken up about the enjoying or wanting of Chriſt; and when he is away (either really, or to their ſenſe) they will not eaſily be convinced of any exceſſe in ſorrow and anxiety: for, ſhe juſtifieth her challenged weeping from this, <hi>Becauſe they have taken away my Lord,</hi> as pleading that ſhe could not ſorrow enough, or too much, becauſe of this. 6. Unbelief and miſtakes, once taking place in an affectionate heart, are not eaſily rooted out; and do prove real obſtructions, hindring the minde from adverting to any thing which might cure them: for, albeit, ſince ſhe firſt vented this her miſtake to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> v. 2. ſhe had met with much which might have cleared her, (as her repeated ſight of the empty grave with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and her ſight of Angels there, and her reproofe from them,) Yet ſhe heeds none of theſe, but perſiſts in her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> 7.

                  <p>The third particular in this narration, is, <hi>Maries</hi> meeting with Chriſt, and conferring with him, before ſhe knew him: She turning about from the Angels, ſeeth Chriſt, but knew him not, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and he enquiring concerning her ſorrow, and whom ſhe was ſeeking after: She, ſuppoſing him to be the gardner, makes offer, that if he had removed his body, and would ſhew her where he had laid it, ſhe would carry him away, not to trouble him any more, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. No company will ſatisfie nor refreſh ſuch as love and are ſeeking Chriſt, when they finde not him, nor ſatisfactory news concerning him, among them: Therefore, albeit <hi>Mary</hi> enjoy the company of Angels, yet ſince ſhe ſaw not Chriſt there, and what they ſaid (whatever it was in it ſelfe, yet) did not ſatisfie her, therefore, <hi>when ſhe had thus ſaid, ſhe turned her ſelfe back.</hi> It is not needful to determine, whether ſhe did this of her own proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or whether ſome noiſe of one behind her, or ſome motion of the Angels upon Chriſts appearing, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it; But this is certain, that not finding ſatisfaction
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48148:210"/>
there, ſhe ſtayes not with them, but takes hold of all other occaſions of finding him. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.3, 4. 2. When means do not afford preſent ſatisfaction to ſeekers of Chriſt, it is not becauſe they ſhall not be ſatisfied; but becauſe Chriſt will be more immediatly (though never without the uſe, or in the neglect of means) ſoon in comforting them; for, therefore is it, that Angels did not ſatisfie her to her ſenſe, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe was to give her ſatisfaction; and Chriſt ſtops their further conference, by his appearing and cauſing her <hi>turn back,</hi> as delighting to comfort her himſelfe. 3. Chriſt is not ſo far oft as readily affectionate Saints do apprehend; but is neere at hand to manifeſt himſelfe and be found, when their hopes are loweſt, and all probable means do faile; for, now when ſhe knoweth not where they have laid Chriſt, and no mean had yet given her the comfort ſhe deſired, Chriſt is yet at her hand, <hi>ſhe turned her ſelfe back, and ſaw Jeſus ſtanding,</hi> and not dead, as ſhe ſuppoſed. 4. Chriſt is ſo conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to his affectionate people, as when they faile exceedingly in their way of ſeeking him, yet he will ſeek them in their way, and will give them, not what they deſire, but, what they need: for, albeit ſhe fail in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dead Chriſt, at or in his grave, yet, conſidering her affection and need, he cometh unto her, <hi>ſhe ſaw Jeſus ſtanding.</hi> 5. Chriſt may be very preſent and neer unto his people, when yet he is not diſcerned, by reaſon of their weakneſſe and ſhort-coming in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, <hi>ſhe ſaw Jeſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was Jeſus,</hi> not becauſe he took on a ſtrange ſhape, but becauſe ſhe was not only withheld, for a time, from knowing him as <hi>Luke</hi> 24.16, 31. but her weakneſſe and not expecting a living Chriſt, made her not to diſcern him. 6. When Chriſt appeareth, even to give ſenſible ſatisfaction to his own, he will own and approve what any ſent from him have ſaid in his name, as ſufficient to encourage them, and as a ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe that they made not uſe thereof accordingly; Therefore, doth he at firſt ſpeak the ſame thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which the Angels had ſaid, <hi>woman why weepeſt thou,</hi> &amp;c? that when ſhe came to know him ſhe might conſider, that, that meſſage had been ſent by him for her encouragement, and that there was more in it then ſhe ſaw. 7. Chriſt may, for a time, ſeem to carry himſelf ſtrangely, even toward thoſe whom he loveth dearly; That ſo he may bring out more of their affection, and more of their weakneſſe alſo, both which are uſeful for them; Therefore, doth he, at firſt ſpeak like a ſtranger. <hi>woman why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou?</hi> which though it import much, yet it is not ſo homely nor ſo clear, as he ſpeaks afterward. 8. Whatever be Saints apprehenſions concerning Chriſt, or their enjoying of him; yet he is in ſuch a caſe, and their condition ſo good, as may juſtly condemne all exceſſive ſorrow; for, ſo much doth this queſtion and challenge, <hi>why weepeſt thou?</hi> import, That however ſhe mourned for him as dead, and for her own want of him; yet he was alive and near her, and therefore ſhe had no cauſe ſo to weep. 9. People ought to take good heed how they ſet and employ their precious affections, and upon what, and for what, they pour them out liberally; for, ſo much alſo do theſe queſtions, <hi>why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou?</hi> import; that ſhe ſhould look whom ſhe ſought ſo affectionatly; And we all ought to examine whether our affections be let out upon things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are of worth in themſelves. 10. As Saints conſidering whom they ſeek, when they are ſeeking Chriſt, may help to beget affection in the purſute; ſo alſo it may hinder affection from being heartleſſe and dejected in making enquirie; for, ſo mmch further do theſe queſtions import, that however her ſeeking Chriſt might kindle her affection toward ſo deſireable an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; her very ſeeking of him portended ſo much, as might drive away all exceſſive or deſperate ſorrow. 11. As our own falſe and weak conceptions breed our miſtakes of Chriſt, (for, <hi>ſhe ſuppoſed him to be gardner,</hi> becauſe ſhe thought none other could be there ſo early;) So our miſtakes of him do lead us to emprove opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his preſence but very poorly; for, this miſtake cauſeth the force and importance of his queſtions ſink nothing in her mind, and draweth out ſo poor and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (though affectionate) an anſwer. 12. Love to Chriſt will make us ſtoop low, even to the meaneſt, if thereby we may get a fight of him, or be furthered to do him ſervice; Therefore doth ſhe, with ſo much reſpect, petition the ſuppoſed gardner in this matter, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if thou haſt bourn him hence,</hi> &amp;c. 13. Love to Chriſt will ſet him ſo high in Saints eſteem, as they will think he ſhould be ſo alſo in every bodies eyes; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith ſhe only, <hi>if thou haſt born him hence,</hi> not naming him: and this ſhe did, not only, becauſe ſhe might ſuppoſe he had heard what paſt betwixt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and her, or might know whom ſhe meant, if he had removed his body; But becauſe Chriſt was the only One in her minde, therefore ſhe thinks every one ſhould know and eſteem of him. Thus alſo doth the ſpouſe deſigne him to others <hi>Him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> Cant. 3.3. 14. Unbelief and miſtakes are ſo prevalent with Saints, in the hour of their tentation, that they are not ſoon removed, and they will ſooner apprehend any thing, then the truth concerning Chriſt; for, after all her doubts concerning the empty grave, and the taking away of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 2. ſhe now ſuppoſeth it might have been done by the gardner, <hi>if thou haſt borne him hence,</hi> not to bury him in a more ſitting place, but as troubling the garden; and that albeit <hi>Joſeph</hi> had allowed him the grave. And ſo ſhe ſuppoſeth him to be dead ſtill. 15. Affection toward Chriſt will not ſtand to conſult with ability, but with it ſelfe and its deſires, and accordingly, will undertake and endeavour to do him ſervice, though never ſo far above its ſtrength; Therefore doth a weak woman all alone, offer to bear away the body of Chriſt, to ſee it more conveniently buried, <hi>Tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth particular in this Narration, is, Chriſts making himſelfe known to <hi>Mary,</hi> which he doth with a word, to her ſatisfaction. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is the power of miſtake, that Saints may turn their back even upon a preſent Chriſt, while he is not diſcerned, as expecting no ſatisfaction nor comfort from him; and Saints may be brought very low, in their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Love in Chriſt cannot long conceal it ſelfe, nor him, from affectionate needy Saints, but will come over, even their failings to afford them comfort; for, notwithſtanding her failings, in her miſtakes of his preſence, and concerning his reſurrection, he ſpeedily makes himſelfe known. 3. <hi>A</hi> little thing, yea, even one word, when Chriſt bleſſeth it, will bring comfort to needy ſouls, and will open their eyes, and cure their diſtempers for, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but <hi>ſaith unto her, Mary:</hi> and <hi>ſhe turneth her ſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. as one now ſatisfied. 4. Chriſt hath a particular knowledge of his own, and there is a mutual knowledge betwixt Chriſt and his ſheep, that they (when their ſenſes are exerciſed,) will diſcerne and know his voice, when he ſpeaketh but a little, and that after they have miſtaken him before in their diſtempers; for, <hi>he ſaith unto her, Mary,</hi> as knowing her particularly, and though ſhe heard him ſpeak before and knew him not, yet now this word brings her to know him, and diſcern his voyce. 5. <hi>As</hi> a ſight, and the diſcerning, of Chriſt is very raviſhing to ſuch as love him; (for, ſo much is imported that ſhe can ſay no more, but <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boni</hi>) So when ever he appears to his own, they will evidence their reſpect to him, as to a Maſter and Teacher, who muſt guide and inſtruct them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth ſhe make uſe of this warm compellation, <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boni, which is to ſay Maſter,</hi> as evidencing how ſad it was to her to be left Maſterleſſe, and how ſweet it was to get a Maſter and Teacher again.</p>

                  <p>The fifth particular in this Narration, is, Chriſts direction and commiſſion to <hi>Mary,</hi> now when ſhe knoweth him. It doth appear that ſhe was about to touch and embrace Chriſt, but he prohibits her, and ſends her with a commiſſion to acquaint his diſciples with his begun exaltation; and that having now riſen from the dead, he was to aſcend unto the Father, for their comfort, and the further clearing of their intereſt in God through him. As for this prohibition to touch him; The reaſon ſubjoyned, and the matter given her in commiſſion to the diſciples concerning his aſcenſion, may ſeem to import a reproofe of her carnal diſpoſition, who doated on his bodily preſence, and delighted to be touching him; and to teach her, that (now he being riſen from the dead) he would not be tryſted with, nor enjoyed in a carnal corporal manner, as formerly, but ſhe is to expect and wait till his aſcenſion, and then ſhe and the reſt might tryſt with him and touch him, not bodily, but ſpiritually and by faith. And it is indeed true, That even the moſt affectionate Saints may be exceeding carnal in their way of, and deſires after, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of Chriſt, and, That, Chriſt being now exalted, it requires much ſpiritual converſe with him, and that we do not expect a carnal or bodily preſence: It being the woful fruit of carnal diſpoſitions, that becauſe men cannot aſcend up to Chriſt by faith, therefore they fancy a carnal and bodily preſence of Chriſt on earth with them. Yet I take not this as the only, nor chief ſcope of this ſpeech; for, however, after Chriſts aſcenſion, it is the groſſe miſtake of men to fancy or doat upon his bodily preſence (as that interpretation beareth well, agreeably to the Scriptures.) And it was <hi>Maries</hi> fault, if ſhe looked on this as the higheſt degree of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and did not expect that he was to aſcend into heaven, but to ſtay among them, as formerly: Yet we finde that many were admitted to touch him, in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their affection, and for confirmation of their own faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.9. and Chriſt invites them to it, <hi>Luke</hi> 24 39. And <hi>Thomas</hi> is reprehended, not ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for deſiring of this, but, becauſe he would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beleeve. Therefore I take up Chriſts ſcope to be, as in part, to put her in minde that he was to aſcend, and therefore ſhe was not to feed her ſelfe with any expectation of his bodily preſence to be continued with them, as formerly; So chiefly to excite her to make haſt with the good news to his diſciples, ſeeing there was yet time enough before his aſcenſion, wherein ſhe might converſe with him and touch him, ſo far as was needful for the confirmation of her faith. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do affectionate ſouls met with Chriſt, but they fall into ſome miſcarriage, and do need caution or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; for, <hi>Mary</hi> needs this prohibition, <hi>Touch me not,</hi> being ready to miſcarry through her carnal diſpoſition running in affections channel, or through ſelfiſhneſſe, and forgetting the needy diſciples. 2. Whatever Chriſt with-hold from any of his, in their doing ſervice to him, he knows how to make it up, in ſo far as is for their good; for, ſo much doth this reaſon import, <hi>for I am not yet aſcended to my Father,</hi> and therefore <hi>Mary</hi> may get time enough, after this ſervice is over, to ſatisfie her ſelfe with touching of him. 3. It is the will of Chriſt, that ſuch as have any good news of Chriſt, do publiſh it in their ſtation, to the edification of others, eſpecially of theſe who are in diſtreſſe and ſorrow; And that they do not ſelfiſhly pleaſe themſelves only; for, ſaith he, <hi>touch me not,</hi> which might ſatisfie thy ſelfe; <hi>but go to my brethren,</hi> &amp;c. who are in deep ſorrow, and know not ſo much as thou doſt. 4. Whatever we may think of our conditions, yet in Chriſts account, it is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be about ſervice for Chriſt, and doing good to others in our ſtation and generation, then to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaping our own particular content and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; for, Chriſt propounds it as better to <hi>Mary</hi> to be the meſſenger of theſe good news, then to ſtay with him ſatisfying her own ſenſes. 5. Chriſts glory and exaltation doth not diminiſh his affections toward his people, but rather the expreſſions thereof are enlarged: Therefore, after his reſurrection, his thoughts run earneſtly upon the ſorrow of the diſciples, to have it eaſed, and that under the name of Brethren (<hi>go unto my brethren, and ſay unto them,</hi> &amp;c.) whereas before, <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, little children,</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> were their uſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations. Yea, <hi>Peter,</hi> the fallen man, is not forgotten by name, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.7. 6. Chriſts moſt ſatisfactory manifeſtations within time, are not fitted to our carnal deſires and diſpoſitions, but are uſefully ſeaſoned with ſuch a degree of diſtance, as may diſappoint theſe, and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48148:211"/>
teach us to be more ſpiritual, and may train us on to long after the full enjoyment of him in heaven; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Chriſt, both in his ſpeech to <hi>Mary,</hi> and in his commiſſion to the diſciples, put them in minde of his <hi>aſcending to the Father,</hi> that their carnal hearts might not look on his reſurrection as the higheſt pitch of his glory, and ſo dream that there was no more to do, but enjoy him as formerly; But that they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſhortly to want his bodily preſence, that ſo they may ſeek to enjoy him by faith. 7. Chriſt doth very far exceed the weak deſires of his people, in affording them ground of comfort; for, whereas ſhe and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would even now have been content of a dead Chriſt, much more of a Chriſt living and riſen again, Chriſt allowes them greater newes of a Chriſt glorified in heaven, <hi>I aſcend,</hi> &amp;c. 8. Whatever carnal hearts do think of a bodily preſence of Chriſt; yet his removal and exaltation in heaven is beleevers great advantage, and the ground of their comfort; As proving their ſurety to ſtand in right tearmes with the Father, after he hath had the price to Juſtice; That it is his Father and God with whom he is to deal on their behalfe; and, That he being thus exalted, is able to do for them, and ſave them to the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Narration we have recorded, the time and way of his appearing and his ſcope in it. The time of it was that ſame day on which he aroſe, and that in the evening, when the diſciples were met together, and conferring upon what evidences they had formerly received of his reſurrection, as may be gathered from <hi>Luke</hi> 24.33, 34, 35. with 36 and the manner of his appearing was, that when they are thus cloſely met, and had ſhut the doores for fear of the Jewes, he, on a ſuddain appears in the midſt of them. Which is not to be underſtood, as if he had come in through the doore by penetrating thereof, and yet his body and the doore retaining ſtill their true quantities and dimenſions; nor yet as if his body were inviſibly every where, and did but become viſible when and where he pleaſed: for Chriſt doth often argue the truth of his reſurrection from his having the properties of a true body, amongſt which properties the having of dimenſions and extended quantity, and being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in one place at one time, are not the leaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but moſt eſſentially requiſite to a body; And it expreſſely ſaid, He <hi>came and ſtood in the midſt,</hi> and conſequently, he was not there before. Beſide, it is here marked, that <hi>the doores were ſhut,</hi> not to point out his miraculous coming through the doore, but the time when he came, that it was unexpected by them. And it is to be conceived, that he did inſenſibly, as to them, open the doores, and ſo came in, and after that ſhut them, rather then that he came through the doore: For ſo we finde the Lord hath done in other caſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 5 19. &amp; 12.10. His ſcope in appearing, is, partly, to confirme
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48148:211"/>
them in the faith of the reſurrection, <hi>v.</hi>—19, 20. and partly, to renew and confirme their calling to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. for aſſuring them of the truth of his reſurrection, he giveth two evidences that it was he who appeared to them: whereof the firſt (in this verſe) is his uſual ſalutation and allowance of peace unto them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt by his appearing <hi>that ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week,</hi> did not only begin to honour and ſanctifie that day, by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and preſence, which he had appointed for the Chriſtian Sabbath; But doth further teach us, That he is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, but his love will come and will not tarry, and he will rather prevent then prorogate his terms: And by this rule are we to correct our thoughts concerning his dealing; for, albeit he had ſet the tryſt after his reſurrection, to be in <hi>Galilee,</hi> Matth. 26.32. and the Angels had repeated the ſame to the women, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.7. yet his love will not ſtay ſo long, but he will come unto them <hi>the ſame day at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 2. It is the duty of ſcattered Saints, to gather together in times of ſtraits, and to make uſe of the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one of another, as conveniently they may; for, now the ſcattered <hi>Diſciples were aſſembled,</hi> and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one with another, and communicating what light any of them had received, as hath been cleared. See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. 3. It hath been no ſtrange thing in the Church, that Saints have been put to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent their aſſemblies with great fear, and have been forced to meet in the dark-night, and with great caution, becauſe of danger from perſecutors; for, they were met <hi>at evening, and the doores were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jewes.</hi> And this may teach us to bleſſe the Lord for our liberty. 4. The danger and hazard wherein Diſciples are, will not hold Chriſt from their company; And he can come, even when he is little expected, and many impediments are in his way: for, when they are in this caſe, and when the doores are ſhut, and they little expect him, <hi>Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt,</hi> which poſture alſo points at the manner of his preſence among his people, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. Namely, that he is very near to every one of them, and they all round about him, and that he takes not a weak liſt, nor hath a remote influence upon their way and ſociety. 5. Peace is Chriſts company and allowance to his people where he cometh; And as it is he who can command and ſpeak peace, ſo he alloweth it upon them, whatever his dealing be, or he ſpeak unto them beſide; for, by this he evidenced his preſence, that he <hi>ſaith unto them, peace be unto you,</hi> which was his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and legacy before his ſuffering, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.27. And this he alloweth upon them, however he upbraided them at the ſame time, as it is <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14. and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition alſo to any terrour they might have, by reaſon of his ſo ſuddain and unexpected appearing among them.</p>

                  <p>The next (and a more clear) evidence of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is, by ſhewing them his pierced hands and ſide, and the ſcars and wounds which he yet retained after his reſurrection, (though it be needleſſe to determine, whether he keep them to all eternity, or not.)

Chriſt will not forget how dearly his people (though worthleſſe) coſt him, that ſo, he may ſee the better to his purchaſe; Therefore alſo did he retain the print of theſe wounds (at leaſt for a time) in his begun exaltation. 4.

                  <p>The ſecond part of Chriſts ſcope and errand in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, is, to confirme and renew their calling to the Apoſtleſhip and work of the Miniſtry, who had juſt cauſe to be much ſhaken with the remembrance of their faint-heartedneſſe in his late ſufferings. It containeth three particulars; In the firſt whereof, (in this verſe) after a preface, wherein he reneweth his allowance of peace unto them, He doth in general commiſſionate and ſend them to the work of the Miniſtry, as the Father ſent him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Diſciples are ſo often eſſayed and oppoſed in their enjoying of Chriſts allowed peace, that they need to have the ſenſe thereof, and their right thereunto, often renewed and repeated unto them by Chriſt; Therefore he <hi>ſaid unto them again,</hi> (after that <hi>v.</hi> 19.) <hi>peace be unto you.</hi> 2. The ſumme of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is peace, as being ſent to publiſh the glad tidings of the Goſpel of peace, and the ſcope of their work being to bring people
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48148:212"/>
to enjoy ſound and ſolid peace in the due order: Therefore alſo doth he ſay, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Commiſſion and emploiment. 3. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel of peace have much need of Chriſts peace, both to ſupport them under the tribulation they will meet with, in diſcharge of their truſt, and to enable them experimentally to preach that peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; Therefore, further doth he ſay, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> to qualifie and encourage them for this work, and that they, having received this peace, might be fit preachers of it. 4. It pleaſed the Father to ſend his own Son into the world, cloathed with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that hereby he might give a proof of his great love unto loſt man; for, <hi>my Father hath ſent me,</hi> ſaith he. 5. Chriſt did not leave his Church deſtitute when his own Miniſtry was ended, but hath ſubſtituted a Miniſtry in his Name, till the end of the world; for, ſaith he, <hi>I ſend you,</hi> which was true of them and their ſucceſſours to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. 6. Miniſters are of Chriſts ſending and employing by his ſoveraign authority, as his Courts and Miniſters, do, miniſterially in his Name, ſend them out; they muſt not run unſent; they who want them, and would have them bleſſed to them, ſhould ſeek them of him; They who are lawfully called are to act in his Name and Authority, which is to be acknowledged by people in their diſcharge of their truſt; and ſuch meſſengers are to be looked on as a great and ſpecial gift beſtowed on the Church by her exalted Lord. All this is imported in this, <hi>I ſend you,</hi> now when he is riſen from the dead, in his begun exaltation. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. — 11. 7. This proportion and compariſon inſtitute betwixt Chriſts ſending and theirs, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you,</hi> is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood univerſally, as to all the works and ends for which Chriſt was ſent, for he was ſent to ſatisfie divine juſtice, and to do the work of Redemption, which they were not: But it is to be underſtood of the work of the Miniſtry and preaching of the Goſpel. Nor yet is there an equality to be urged here, but the proportion and diſtance is ſtill to be obſerved and kept betwixt the Lord and his ſervants, and the Bridegroom and his friends. Nor is the reſemblance only in this, that as Chriſt was immediately ſent by the Father, ſo were they (as Apoſtles) immediately ſent by him. But Chriſts being ſent by his Father, and their being ſent by him, do agree, 1. In the ſtrictneſſe of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that as Chriſt did alwayes the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo they muſt not diſpenſe with what is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their truſt, nor be the ſervants of men. 2. They agree in having the ſame promiſe of ſucceſſe &amp; bleſſing in their labours, as the Apoſtles richly found. 3. They do agree in the matter of their authority, ſo far as, however he be the Lord, and they ſervants, yet they come cloathed with the ſame authority, being in Chriſts ſtead to the people of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and Chriſt, and God in Chriſt, being deſpiſed in the affronts put upon them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42.</p>

The firſt whereof (in theſe verſes) is, the occaſion of his appearing at this time; and this is either more remote, That <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> (of whom we have already heard, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.16. and 14.5.) was not with them at their laſt meeting with Chriſt, being not as yet returned from his lurking place, <hi>v.</hi> 24.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> more near, That when the reſt of the diſciples acquaint him, (either having ſought him out, or he coming unto them) that they had ſeen the Lord, he wilfully profeſſeth he will not beleeve, unleſs he get the ſenſible ſatisfaction preſcribed by himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 25. for clearing whereof we are to conſider, that it was not his ſin ſimply that he deſired a ſight of Chriſt; nor yet that he ſought that evidence of his pierced, hands &amp; of the hole of his ſide (which it appeareth was now known to all the diſciples, though <hi>John</hi> only record that he ſaw it, <hi>chap.</hi> 19 34, 35.) ſeeing that was the ſame evidence which Chriſt himſelfe had given, <hi>v.</hi> 20. and his deſire of this did evidence his affection unto a crucified Chriſt: But it was his fault, not to beleeve the truth of Chriſts Reſurrection, till he not only ſaw this, but thruſt his hand alſo into his ſide, for further ſatisfaction. Neither was it his ſin, that ſimply he would not hearken to their report, as men, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing that is no ſure ground of faith: But it was his ſin, that he did not beleeve the Scriptures, which ſpake of Chriſts Reſurrection, and ſo did not beleeve them as Gods witneſſes, unleſſe he got ſenſible ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. They may be truly gracious, who yet are very timorous in a trial, and will not recover from their feares ſo ſoon as others; for, <hi>Thomas,</hi> a godly man, <hi>was not with them,</hi> nor had returned to the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety as yet, when the reſt had recollected themſelves, 2. Negligence in frequenting the ſociety and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the people of God, caſts men far behinde,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48148:213"/>
and prejudgeth them much; for, <hi>But Thomas one of the twelve, called Didymus,</hi> (of the ſignification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſee on <hi>chap.</hi> 11.16.) <hi>was not with them when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came,</hi> and ſo he was deprived not only of the good newes which <hi>Mary</hi> and others brought them, but of that comfortable ſight of him alſo, which they got, and he is left in many ſnares and doubtings, from which they are delivered. 3. Diſciples ought to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative in their ſtation, of what they have received; and when their hearts are refreſhed with a ſweet ſight of Chriſt, they cannot but make it known, as they have a calling and opportunity; for, <hi>The other diſciples therefore ſaid unto him, We have ſeen the Lord,</hi> which no doubt they told with all the circumſtances of it, whereof this was the ſumme, and that which moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them, and ſluck with them. 4. Chriſt ſhould be very great in his diſciples eſtimation, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him ſhould be upon the growing hand; for, now he is ſtill <hi>the Lord,</hi> v. 2. 13, 18, 20, 28 and <hi>ch.</hi> 21. 7, 12, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was a ſtile more rarely given him before. 5. Unbelief is ſtrangely rooted in the hearts of all men, yea, even of godly men and diſciples: ſo that they may frequently fall into that ſin, and be very pertinacious in it; for, ſo much doth <hi>Thomas</hi> his example teach us, <hi>I will not beleeve,</hi> ſaith he. 6. Our carnal hearts know no way, not will admit of any cure of unbelief, unleſſe they get all the objects of ſaith under the view of their ſenſes; for, ſo is it with <hi>Thomas</hi> here, he will <hi>ſee,</hi> and leſt his ſight ſhould be deluded, he will touch alſo, and <hi>thruſt his hand into his ſide.</hi> 7. It is the great ſin and weakneſſe of men, when they do not beleeve, unleſſe they get ſatisfaction to their ſenſes, ſeeing faith is <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11.1. But it is yet a greater ſin, and an height of preſumption, to be wilful in unbelief, and to be ſo bold as to ſay they will not beleeve, upon grounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and afforded by him, unleſſe they get their will; which is a limiting of the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for, this was <hi>Thomas</hi> his fault, <hi>Except I ſhall ſee, &amp;c. I will not beleeve.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond particular in this Narration is, Chriſts appearing to them again after a week, when <hi>Thomas</hi> is met with them, and that after the former manner, and with the former ſalutation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. This appearing of Chriſt among them is ſaid to be, <hi>after eight dayes,</hi> not eight dayes after <hi>Thomas</hi> his profeſſed unbelief, (though it is like the diſciples had told him the good newes ſpeedily) but after his former appearing, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and upon the firſt day of the next week. And he did then appear unto them, not only becauſe it was their uſual meeting-day, or to try the faith of the reſt, by <hi>Thomas</hi> his continuing in doubting and unbelief. But chiefly, to teach us, That however the Lord will help and cure the unbelief of his own, yet when they are wilful and peremptory in it, it is righteous with him, to let them lie under it for a time, till they feel the evil and bitterneſſe of it, and till they ſee their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to be given up to it, that ſo they may magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his mercy who cometh over it; Therefore doth <hi>Thomas</hi> meet with this correction, that he ſeeth not Chriſt till <hi>after eight dayes,</hi> and ſo had a ſad week of it. 2. The people of God ought not to forſake their mutual ſocieties and aſſembling of themſelves together, but they ſhould continue therein, as they expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed preſence of Chriſt with them; for, it is, when <hi>again his diſciples were within, that Jeſus came, the doores being ſhut, and ſtood in the midſt.</hi> 3. Whatever be the failings or unbelief of Saints: yet it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in them to be amending their other known faults and neglects: And there is ſtill hope of their caſe, ſo long as they uſe the means whereby they may be cured of their unbelief, and do not, with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, quit the uſe of means alſo; for, it is here marked, that in this meeting, <hi>Thomas was with them,</hi> though yet doubting: wherein appears, that being ſenſible of his former loſſe, he keeps the ſociety and meetings of the diſciples, to ſee what clearing he might finde; And ſo not only amended his former fault, (which yet is moſt rare to ſee) but waits on in the uſe of appointed means. 4. It is the duty of Chriſts followers, not to loſe or caſt off any, though weak and unbelieving, ſo long as they can get them along with them in any duty, and ſo long as there is any hope of their amendment, and being reclaimed; for, ſo it was commendable on the diſciples part, that <hi>Thomas was with them,</hi> and they had not caſt him off. Where this condeſcendence is wanting, many may be loſt who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be recovered. 5. Chriſt will not be wanting to come over the infirmities of his own to do them good; and he can make good uſe of their worſt things, and is ſo willing to manifeſt himſelf, that he will let no opportunity of it ſlip; for, he makes uſe, even of <hi>Thomas</hi> doubting, as an occaſion of appearing over again, as is clear from the whole tenour of this Narration, both what precedes, and what followeth. 6. Chriſt is not changeable in his love and allowance of peace to his people, but is yeſterday, and to day, the ſame for ever; Therefore, over again doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his ſalutation, <hi>and ſaid, Peace be unto you.</hi>

Chriſt perfectly knoweth, and is acquainted with the caſes and diſtempers of his people, and can tell them what aileth them, albeit they do not tell him; for, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Thomas</hi> intimateth, that without any infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he knew <hi>Thomas</hi> doubtings and unbelief. 2. Albeit Chriſts followers do provoke him by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48148:213"/>
yet he will not quit them, but will deal with them ſo much the more beyond others, as their need and weakneſſe is greater: Therefore, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth here, he dealeth only with <hi>Thomas,</hi> though moſt faulty and weak, <hi>Then ſaith he to Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Chriſt hath a great quarrel at unbelief in his people, (either when they do not beleeve and ponder the truth of what he reveals, or, make not due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to themſelves) as being exceeding injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, and obſcuring his glory, and as obſtructing their own good; for, this Chriſt reproves, and would have amended in <hi>Thomas, be not faithleſſe, but beleeving.</hi> 4. Such as have publickly ſinned to the offending of others, ſhould be publickly dealt with, to take with and amend their fault; That ſo their recovery may ſtrengthen thoſe whom their failings were ready to weaken: Therefore doth Chriſt deal with, and ſeek to reclaim <hi>Thomas,</hi> in preſence of all the diſciples, to whom he had profeſſed his wilful unbelief. 5. Chriſts offering this ſatisfaction to <hi>Thomas,</hi> preſcribed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is not a warrant to every unbeliever and tempter of him, to ſeek and expect this or the like ſignes of their own preſcribing, for helping of their faith, For Chriſts reproof, inſinuate with his offer, and expreſſed after <hi>Thomas</hi> confeſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 29. doth point it out as a ſin, and ſhould teach all beleevers their duty, that they be warned by his example to be humbled that any ſuch preſumption ſhould enter their hearts, and to reject the firſt motions of it. And indeed, ſuch ſignes not being promiſed by God, it is a limiting of him, and an high preſumption, to preſcribe them unto him; and it ſpeaks their proud deſpiſing and contemning of the means appointed by God, ſo to do; And whatever effect this offer had upon <hi>Thomas,</hi> yet there is no promiſe that any of theſe ſignes preſcribed ſhould work faith, when we beleeve not the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29, 30, 31. and therefore it were to no purpoſe to grant them. Yet this procedure with <hi>Thomas</hi> may teach us, 1. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is ſo hateful to Chriſt in his people, and he is ſo ſenſible of the prejudice they ſuſtain thereby, that he is very careful and earneſt to have it removed and cured; for, ſo much doth his offering him, even his will, to amend his fault, teach us. 2. Chriſt is very conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to his people in their infirmities, and doth oft-times yield very much to their weakneſſe and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſſe, which yet it is their fault to ſeek, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imitate them in it; for, ſo much alſo doth this inſtance of his condeſcendence to <hi>Thomas,</hi> teach us. 3. Chriſt may deny that to a beleever, which he will grant to a weak beleever; and yet the beleever is more approven, though kept at diſtance, then the unbeleever who is ſo dealt with; for, believing <hi>Mary</hi> gets not ſo much as leave to touch him, <hi>v.</hi> 17. when unbelieving <hi>Thomas</hi> gets an offer both to ſee and touch, but with a check. 4. Unbelievers can limit Chriſt to no proof of his love, which implieth not a contradiction, but, if he ſaw it fitting, he could give it; ſo that it is not for want of power, that ſuch tempters are not ſatisfied, but becauſe he will not learne them to ſleight his Word, on which they ought to build; for, here, by offering unto <hi>Thomas</hi> all he deſired, he gives proof how eaſie it were for him, to ſatisfie the like unreaſonable deſires.</p>

                  <p>The fourth particular in this Narration, is, the uſe which <hi>Thomas</hi> makes of this offer. It ſeems he did not preſume to touch Chriſt, or thruſt his hand into his ſide, but contented himſelf with <hi>ſeeing</hi> Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 29. as abhorring his own folly in ſo preſcribing. But, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he ſaw, and upon the conſideration of Chriſts condeſcendence and his weakneſſe, he gives a faire confeſſion concerning Chriſts Deity, and cloſeth with him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Great mountains of unbelief, which ſeem inſuperable unto Saints, will eaſily flow down and evaniſh at Chriſts preſence; for, <hi>Thomas</hi> his wilfulneſſe is now cured without making uſe (as appeareth) of all that he required. 2. It is the duty of ſuch as have offended others by their failings, to be eminent and exemplary in their recovering of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And God may, oft-times, make the laſt to be firſt, in their out-ſtripping others who were before them; for, here <hi>Thomas</hi> who had miſcarried ſo far, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a fairer confeſſion then any of the reſt had done. 3. When Chriſt is well ſeen, and the way of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and his condeſcendence to his people are well conſidered, he will be undeniably ſeen to be God; for, <hi>Thomas,</hi> now perſwaded of his Reſurrection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his dealing with him, crieth out that he is <hi>God,</hi> ſeeing no man could riſe ſo as he did, but he who is God alſo, which his tender kindneſſe to himſelf did further confirme. 4. Chriſt being looked upon in his glory, and as God, it may and ſhould allure hearts to cloſe with and embrace him: and they who indeed conſider him to be ſuch a one, cannot but claim to an intereſt in him: Therefore <hi>Thomas</hi> calls him <hi>my God.</hi> 5. Such as finde the ſweetneſſe of an intereſt in Chriſt as their God, it will perſwade their hearts to allow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a dominion and Lordſhip over them, to guide and diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure; for, <hi>Thomas</hi> here conjoyneth theſe, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi>

                  <p>The laſt particular in this Narration, is, Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of <hi>Thomas,</hi> now when he is recovered; wherein he extenuates his beleeving now, and not till now, and commends and bleſſeth all theſe who ſhall beleeve, though they ſee not. As all they do, who embrace and cloſe with Chriſt crucified and riſen again, as he is held out in the Goſpel, as all theſe alſo who beleeved before his Incarnation, though they were not eye-witneſſes thereof. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though Chriſt be tender and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to cure the unbelief of his people, and though they may recover out of their fits, and give a faire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith; yet he would not have them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the evil of their unbelief, to reprove and judge themſelves for it; Therefore, now when <hi>Thomas</hi> is beleeving, yet he will rebuke him for his weakneſſe. 1. Chriſt is a skilful and tender Phyſitian, who allows
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48148:214"/>
not, nor intends that we ſhould be put away, or our faith weakned, by his reproofs; Therefore, he will not reprove, except in an indirect way, <hi>v.</hi> 27. till firſt he beleeve and be ſtrengthened. 3. To ſuſpend our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving upon our ſight is reproof-worthy, and in ſome ſort extenuates that faith, in Chriſts account: And ſuch as get ſatisfaction to their ſenſe to cure their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, ought yet to conſider that Chriſt hath a quarrel at them, whereof they ought to be ſenſible and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, by way of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</hi> Where he doth not condemn the reſt of the diſciples, who both beleeved and ſaw, but only his ſuſpending his faith on his ſeeing. 4. It is a great bleſſedneſſe and mercy to beleeve and get faith, as put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them who get it, in a bleſſed and ſweet eſtate of calmneſſe and aſſurance, and furniſhing them with a ſhield, whereby to ward off many fiery darts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pledge and fore-runner of ſweet manifeſtations and performances from the Lord; for, <hi>bleſſed are they that have beleeved.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 1.45. And this holds true of all beleevers, even of <hi>Thomas</hi> his own faith, though ſome ſhare more in it then others. 5. The leſſe ſenſible evidence there be of the object of faith, (provided it be revealed in the Word) there is the greater bleſſedneſſe in beleeving thereof; and ſuch faith will be the more excellent and commendable in Chriſts ſight, as participating more of the nature of faith, and giving more glory to him; for, <hi>bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have beleeved.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22.—28. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.8.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt part of this Chapter, <hi>John</hi> being about to cloſe this Evangel, and many other things coming into his minde which Chriſt had done after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he (ſo to ſay) draweth pen from paper, confeſſing there were many ſuch like, which he was not directed to write, (not only becauſe ſome of them were recorded by the reſt, but) in regard what he had written, was ſufficient to faith and ſalvation, and to clear what Chriſt was, and confirme that ſalvation is to be had through faith in him. For clearing of this purpoſe, Conſider, 1. That theſe things which <hi>John</hi> confeſſeth to have omitted here, are particularly ſuch things as were done by Chriſt after his Reſurrection; for, theſe were done <hi>in the preſence of his diſciples,</hi> whereas theſe things he did before his death, were done generally before all; Though it be alſo true of theſe his other acts, that they were not all recorded by him nor by the reſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.25. 2. What <hi>John</hi> propounds <hi>v.</hi> 31. as his end in writing theſe things, is indeed the ſcope of all this Hiſtory of the Goſpel written by him, and ſo doth relate to all he hath formerly written. But it doth particularly relate to theſe ſignes formerly mentioned, which in their own kinde, and in the way of miracles influence, were ſufficient, (without adding any more) to confirme the doctrine all along delivered, concerning the perſon of the Meſſiah, and the way of obtaining ſalvation through him. 3. <hi>John</hi> doth omit the writing of theſe ſignes, and tells of it, not to give occaſion of ſlandering the Scriptures as imperfect, nor to curious men to enquire after them, and obtrude them upon the Church. For what he omits, is not points of doctrine, but only particular ſignes of the ſame nature and kinde with theſe recorded; and what he records, is ſufficient to ſalvation, in ſo far as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are props to faith, as he cleareth, <hi>v.</hi> 31. Beſide, How ſhall any know infallibly that the miracles they alledge to be Chriſts, are truly ſuch, ſeeing the Word doth not point them out particularly? And if any think Scripture is imperfect, becauſe it hath not all theſe ſignes, how can they aſſert they have indeed marked <hi>all,</hi> ſeeing they are many and innumerable, <hi>chap,</hi> 21.25. and ſo, by their own principles, the Church ſhall be at a loſſe ſtill. 4. Albeit theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>John,</hi> be ſufficient for the ends recorded by him, yet we are not to think that Chriſts doing of theſe he omitted, was uſeleſſe, though it was not needful he ſhould write them; for not only was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the time, that they ſhould be multiplied, to confirme the doubting diſciples in the faith of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but it is needful for us to know he did ſo many, though we know not in particular what they were. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It ſpeaks out Chriſts great praiſe and glory, that beſide the many glorious acts recorded to be done by him, particularly after his Reſurrection, we may be perſwaded that he did many more, and that he is one, whoſe glorious acts it were an endleſſe task to publiſh; for, this end, and that we may have high thoughts of Chriſt doth <hi>John</hi> record, that, <hi>many other ſignes truly did Jeſus in preſence of his diſciples, which are not written in this book.</hi> And this ſpeaks his praiſe more, then if <hi>John</hi> had recorded many more particulars. 2. The Lord would have his people not doating too much on ſignes and miracles, which are only extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and remote props of faith; but would have them acquieſcing in what he works or records of theſe: Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> omit the Narration of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which the diſciples ſaw, to the Church, in after-ages, that they might learn not to reſt much on theſe, but to faſten upon the Word, which is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by what is recorded. 3. The Scriptures are not intended mainly for recording multitudes of ſignes and miracles, for the ſatisfaction of curioſity, or which might induce idle men to reade them for recreation or putting oft time. But the great ſcope of the Scriptures is, to direct men how to know Chriſt, and ſave their own ſoul; Therefore <hi>John</hi> doth omit theſe ſignes enough, being recorded in ſubſerviency to the great end of the Scriptures, <hi>that ye might beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> And this ſhould be the trial, how we reade Scriptures, and how we profit thereby. 4. No imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can be faſtened upon Scripture, in matters of faith or neceſſary to ſalvation, nay, nor in affording ſufficient ſignes for confirming the doctrine held out therein; even albeit it be clear, that particular things done by Chriſt, are not recorded therein? for, <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:48148:214"/>
grants this, and yet aſſerts the perfection of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>But theſe are written, that ye might beleeve,</hi> &amp;c. See 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16, 17. 5. The great ſcope of the Scripture is, in the firſt place to direct us to know and take up Chriſt rightly, who is the kernel and marrow of all the Scriptures, to whom the law and all the Prophets bear witneſſe, and who is the great ſubject of the Goſpel; for, ſo is here held out, <hi>Theſe things are written that ye might beleeve that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Chriſt is only ſavingly known and taken up by faith; there is no coming to the treaſures of the Scriptures, nor to ſtudy him in them, but by faith, and no reſpective beſide will be tranſparent; for, <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might beleeve,</hi> &amp;c. 7. The great point concerning Chriſt, to be known and beleeved from the Scriptures, is; That Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the only promiſed Meſſiah, and anointed of the Father, He in whom all the law types and ſhaddows are accompliſhed, and in whom the promiſes are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> And, That the ſame Jeſus is alſo, in unity of perſon, the Son of God by eternal generation, one in eſſence, and equal in power and glory with the Father; for, this is the great point to b <hi>beeleeved, that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of God;</hi> which is a large and needful ſtudy 8. The Scriptures are alſo written to point out that there is an eternal life, only worthy of the name of life, and which otherwiſe, is hid from the world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. And to point out how this life may be attained; for, ſo is held out in the next place, as his end of writing, <hi>that ye might have life.</hi> 9. The Scriptures do point out no way of attaining ſalvation but only through faith in Chriſt, and that <hi>in his name,</hi> or as he hath revealed himſelfe; And it doth hold out the way and due order wherein ſinners ought to flee to him, and how they ought to abide in him, and doth promiſe eternal life to all who do ſo; for, the ſubject and doctrine of the Scriptures, is, <hi>that beleeving ye might have life through his name.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. 10. As it is a part of our way to heaven, to be found in the faith and knowledge of Chriſt; So a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, as he is revealed in the Scriptures, and hath confirmed and evidenced the ſame by his miracles, is a ſpecial mean to excite men to ſeek after him, and ſalvation through him, and to encourage them to rely on him for attaining of ſalvation; Therefore is the one ſubjoyned as following on the other, that beleeving <hi>Jeſus to be Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> as the Word holdeth out, and he hath made good by theſe ſignes, they will ſeek life with him, and through him, and will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>beleeve,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>have life through his name.</hi>

                     <hi>John,</hi> in the cloſe of the former Chapter having ſhewed that Chriſt, after his reſurrection, did many ſignes in preſence of his Diſciples which he had not written; He doth in this Chapter give a notable proofe thereof, by recording one notable appearing of Chriſt, wherein many ſignes concurred. This he propoundeth generally, in this verſe undertaking to deſcribe it in its circumſtances, and mentioning the place where it was done; Namely, at and beſide ſome part of the Lake <hi>Genezareth,</hi> which here gets the name from the City <hi>Tiberias,</hi> (which was built upon the ſide of that Lake) and is elſewhere called the ſea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> Joh. 6.1. Chriſt had wrought ſome miracles before in this lake, and in the Towns of <hi>Galilee</hi> about it he had preached and wrought many miracles, and now he doth appear there after his reſurrection (as his ſolemne meeting with the Diſciples was in <hi>Galilee</hi> alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.16, 17.) that he may bring to their remembrance what had paſt there formerly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is needful we be much confirmed in the faith of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, as being a truth not eaſily beleeved indeed, and being beleeved, is full of rich comfort, and a ſure pledge that all Chriſts and his peoples ſufferings, though even unto death, will end in glory; Therefore, <hi>after theſe things,</hi> (and Chriſts ſhewing himſelfe ſo often in the former chapter) <hi>Jeſus ſhewed himſelfe again,</hi> to confirme their faith, who had yet ſome ſcruples, as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>v.</hi> 12. 2. Such as are to publiſh the truths of Chriſt unto others, ought to be ſolidly perſwaded of them themſelves, and do need much from Chriſt for that effect, that ſo they may publiſh them from a ſure perſwaſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. Therefore did he <hi>ſhew himſelf again to the Diſciples,</hi> who were, moſt part (if not all) of them, to publiſh theſe glad tidings throughout the

Chriſts preſence, and manifeſtations of himſelfe, are not reſtricted to any one place; but where ever his people are, there he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as they need; for, <hi>Jeſus ſhewed himſelfe to the Diſciples at the Sea of Tiberias,</hi> as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whence they were now returned, for reaſons to be after mentioned. 4. The particular paſſages and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Chriſts manifeſting of himſelfe to his people ought to be narrowly obſerved and taken notice of, as being full of rich uſe and inſtruction; Therefore doth <hi>John,</hi> who was an eye-witneſſe, undertake here to deſcribe them, <hi>and on this wiſe ſhewed he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>In theſe verſes, the antecedents of his ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe are recorded, That theſe ſeven Diſciples being together, they do upon <hi>Peters</hi> motion, go a fiſhing, wherein they labour all night without any ſucceſſe. As for theſe ſeven, four of them were called to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſo it may be, were the two, who are not named; As for <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> (of whom <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 45, &amp;c.) we do not finde him to be one of them, unleſſe under another name, (as ſome ſuppoſe he was called <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi>) but only a Diſciple and follower of Chriſt. And as for their ſociety and being together at this time, rather then others of the Apoſtles, we need not curiouſly enquire concerning it. It is ſufficient to know that theſe named were countrey-men of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and ſo may we judge of the other two, and ſo they had occaſion to be more frequently together, and are now met at this time, and that, as would appear at <hi>Peters</hi> houſe, who makes the motion of following his trade. It is alſo to be marked, that this overture, propounded by <hi>Peter,</hi> and embraced by the reſt, of returning to their former cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, did not proceed from their diſtruſt and quitting of their miniſterial calling, for we are not ſo to conceive of them who were already endowed with the Holy Ghoſt in ſome meaſure, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.22. But the true cauſe was, that being only deſigned, not yet actually employed, nor fully endowed for that calling, till the Spirit was more fully poured forth upon them, and theſe fourty dayes after the reſurrection of Chriſt, being ſet apart for their confirmation in the faith of his reſurrection, by his frequent appearing unto them, and for their further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by Chriſt, in the matters of the Kingdome of God, which they were afterward to publiſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. And they, at this time being returned from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Galilee,</hi> to keep that meeting which Chriſt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in <hi>Galilee,</hi> of which <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.7, 16, 17. they did lawfully go about their ordinary employment, till the day of the meeting came. However, Chriſt took occaſion of this to manifeſt himſelfe. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The moſt ſpecial and remarkable manifeſtations of Chriſt to his people, are given them when they are together; for, <hi>There were together, Simon Peter,</hi> &amp;c. And albeit <hi>Peter</hi> made a motion for himſelfe, <hi>I go a fiſhing,</hi> which might have ſeparated them, yet providence keeps and ſends them along together, till this manifeſtation come. 2. It is a commendable duty, in theſe who are made ſenſible of their loſſe by being abſent from the ſocieties of Saints, to attend them more conſtantly afterwards; for, here we finde <hi>Thomas</hi> conſtantly continuing in the company of the reſt of the Diſciples. 3. Chriſt doth not eſteem of men, nor deal with them, according as they are of note among others, providing they be honeſt and Diſciples indeed; for, it is marked to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>two other of his Diſciples,</hi> that they <hi>were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> with the reſt, and Chriſt ſheweth himſelfe to them as to the reſt, though their names be not expreſſed, as the reſts are. 4. It is the will of Chriſt, that his followers do not neglect their lawful calling, (though never ſo baſe) as they may overtake it; And in going about their lawful callings, they may expect ſpecial manifeſtations of Chriſt; for, it is commendable in them, that they caſt not off their mean calling, but <hi>Peter ſaith, I go a fiſhing,</hi> and <hi>they ſay unto him, we alſo go with thee,</hi> and <hi>they went forth, and entred into a ſhip immediately.</hi> And it is while they are about this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that Chriſt ſheweth himſelfe to them. 5. The children of the Lord are ſubject to the ſame difficulties, of earning their daily bread, and of hazard, toile and difficulties in their calling, with others; That ſo they may know they are by nature of <hi>Adams</hi> ſtock as well as others, and may not expect ſingular lots in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: for, his Diſciples are put to earn their bread by <hi>fiſhing,</hi> and they are put to work at it all <hi>night,</hi> not for fear, but becauſe it was the fitteſt ſeaſon; and they work ſo hard, as they muſt ſtrip themſelves almoſt naked (as appeareth <hi>v.</hi> 7.) through heat; And all this for their livelyhood, and oft-time with little profit, as after followeth. 6. It may pleaſe the Lord, oft-times, to deny his people ſucceſſe in their lawful employments; And that either, when their hearts are too eager and keen upon the world, he doth juſtly croſſe them, to teach them mortification and ſobriety: Or, becauſe if ſucceſſe were conſtant, God would not be ſo clearly ſeen in his bounty, and therefore he croſſeth, that we may acknowledge him more; Or, becauſe he is to appear eminently for his people, therefore he makes way for his appearing, by denying ſucceſſe upon their endeavours: As here, skilled fiſhers, well acquaint with this lake, and the way of ſpeeding in it, do <hi>that night catch nothing.</hi>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:48148:215"/>
And this maketh way for his after proſpering of them in a miraculous manner.</p>

As for not knowing of him, I will not determine, whether it was becauſe of the darkneſſe, (it being but yet morning) together with their diſtance from Chriſt, being about two hundred cubits, <hi>v.</hi> 8. or by reaſon of ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reſtraining of their ſight and diſcerning for a time: But it may teach us, that Chriſt is not alwaies diſcerned when he is preſent, and it is one mercy to enjoy his company, and another to know indeed that it is he: for, <hi>Jeſus ſtood on the ſhore: but the diſciples knew not that it was Jeſus,</hi> and they after conferre with him as with a ſtranger. 3.

It is commendable in neighbours, or theſe who have occaſion to converſe and traffick together, that they entertain a good correſpondence, by courteous, familiar, and diſcreet expreſſions one to another; Therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Children, have ye any meat?</hi> And he uſeth this compellation here, not as one made known to them, to point out his familiar reſpects unto, and care of them, as a Father hath of his little children; but as the courteous and familiar expreſſions of neighbours in theſe places.</p>

                  <p>The third branch of this Narration contains the way how he came to make himſelfe known unto them. He, having drawn out a confeſſion of their want and ill ſucceſſe, adviſeth them where to caſt out the net, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them ſucceſſe: which they obey (not becauſe they knew him as yet, but becauſe they are not willing to neglect any opportunity or counſel, or poſſibly becauſe they have ſuppoſed him to have skill) and get a great draught, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And by this he is firſt diſcerned by <hi>John,</hi> and by him <hi>Peter</hi> is informed, <hi>v</hi> 7.—which is not to be underſtood as ſecluding the reſt, (for they come alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 8.) but he ſpeak it in audience of all to <hi>Peter</hi> as being neareſt him, or <hi>Peter</hi> is only marked to be ſpoken to, becauſe of his ſingular fact upon this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Chriſt our Mediatour is true God, and hath a providence over all the creatures; even the fiſh of the ſea are under his feet, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where they ſwim, and can command and bring them to his peoples hands, when he pleaſeth; for, he knoweth where the fiſhes are to be found, as having brought them (as appears) from ſome other part of the lake, to the place where they ſo long ſought and found none. <hi>Caſt the net on the right ſide of the ſhip and ye ſhall finde.</hi> 2. When Chriſt is about to do great things for his people, yet he will not have them neglecting means and endeavours; for, though he bring the fiſh to their hand, yet he will not caſt them into the ſhip, but commands them to <hi>caſt the net.</hi> 3. Theſe to whom the bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe of their toile is bleſſed, they will become tractable thereby, and will be ready to hearken to counſel; for, the Diſciples, toiled with labour and bad ſucceſſe all night, do hearken to the counſel of a ſuppoſed ſtranger, <hi>They caſt therefore.</hi> 4. Chriſt ſuffered no decay of his power by his ſufferings and death, but is as able to work wonders, and do for his people, as ever; for, as before he had wrought ſuch a wonder as this, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5, 6. ſo here again, after his reſurrection, <hi>and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fiſhes.</hi> 5 Chriſt is not only a God near hand, but a God a far off alſo, and can do as much for his people at a diſtance, as when he is nearer hand them; for, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. he wrought the like miracle when he was with them, now he works this when he is upon the ſhore, and they in the ſhip. 6. Chriſt did afford this miraculous ſucceſſe, beyond any thing they not only met with, but could expect in their ordinary diligence; Not to give his people any ground of expecting conſtantly ſuch allowances in outward things; but, as to confirme by this (as by other proofes) that he is true God, and to perſwade them that his allowances and workings are liberal, like himſelfe; So alſo, to teach his people, by this and the like inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he could wonderfully provide outward things for them, if it were for their good. As here, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples finde, <hi>they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fiſhes.</hi> And this ſhould teach beleevers to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the ordinary allowances which their wiſe and al-ſufficient Lord carveth out unto them. 7. As
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48148:216"/>
Chriſt will not alwaies keep himſelfe as a ſtranger, but will be known to his people; So he takes pleaſure to make himſelfe known unto his people by a good turn done for them; for, at laſt he makes himſelfe known, and it is by this miraculous allowance, compared with the like miracle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. that <hi>John</hi> knew him. 8. Chriſts working will ſpeak for it ſelfe; and a right diſcerner will know him by his working, though he ſhould never ſpeak one word, to tell what he is; for, <hi>Therefore that diſciple ſaid, it is the Lord,</hi> though he had not told ſo much. 9. Love to Chriſt and feeding on the ſenſe of his love, will help a Diſciple to diſcern and know him, as ſoon as any; for, it is <hi>that diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> who firſt knew, <hi>it is the Lord.</hi> 10. What ever ſingular excellency there be in any diſciples, it floweth not from any thing in themſelves, but from Chriſts love to them; for, it was becauſe he was <hi>that diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> that it is given him to love, and know the Lord. 11. Such as are dignified with any ability to diſcern Chriſt, ought to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof, for the good of others; for, <hi>that diſciple ſaid unto Peter, it is the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>In the fourth branch of this Narration, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar effects and conſequents following upon this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Chriſt, before his conference with <hi>Peter,</hi> are recorded, to <hi>v.</hi> 14. together with <hi>Johns</hi> account of the number and order of this manifeſtation, <hi>v.</hi> 14. The firſt effect of Chriſts manifeſtation, is their coming to land to him, after they knew it was he, <hi>Peter,</hi> waiting for nothing but that he come not naked, doth caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the ſea, to come to Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> — 7. The reſt come ſo faſt as they can, without neglecting the benefit conferred upon them by Chriſt. Therefore, they make haſt to come in a little ſhip, (which it ſeems ſtood beſide the other,) ſeeing it would come ſooner then the greater veſſel, and do drag the net with fiſhes after them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. As for <hi>Peters</hi> coming, we are not to conceive that he came walking miraculouſly on the ſea, for we are not to multiply miracles needleſly: Nor yet that he could wade, ſeeing they were at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, and the ſea ſo deep as to carry a ſhip with all thoſe men and their fiſhing inſtruments: But that he caſt himſelf into the Sea, to come ſwimming. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. A ſight of Chriſt is inviting and alluring, and will make theſe who know him, come to him; As here, they all come when they know him. 2. In the Church of Chriſt, and even among Diſciples and Apoſtles, there is great variety of tempers and diſpoſitions and endowments; Every one hath not alike perfectione in the ſame degree, nor is it to be expected that all will be alike, though all may be ſincere and approved; for, here, <hi>John</hi> is moſt eminent in diſcerning Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> is moſt forward in zeal, and yet all do willingly come to Chriſt. 3. One Diſciple may outſtrip another in expreſſions of forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and zeal, who yet cometh not behinde him, either in knowledge or ſolide love; for, here <hi>John</hi> is eminent in knowledge, and was a true lover of Chriſt, and yet <hi>Peter</hi> outſtrips him in this expreſſion of affection; which flowed, partly, from his natural diſpoſition, and, partly, from the ſenſe of his late fall. 4. The ſhorteſt cut will ſeem far about, if a nearer could be had, to a ſoul filled with zeal and deſire to be at Chriſt; for, ſo did appear in <hi>Peter,</hi> who could not ſtay on a ſhip, though he could come but little ſooner by ſwimming. 5. Zeal will make a man, when he ſeeth Chriſt, forget and quit all, to be at him; for, <hi>Peter</hi> waits not upon the draught of fiſhes, but <hi>when he heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fiſhers coat to him (for he was naked) and did caſt himſelfe into the ſea.</hi> He only ſtayed that he might not come naked, and girt his coat to him that it might not hinder him, nor he loſe it, in ſwimming. 6. To ſwim through deep ſeas (if it were of blood) to be at Chriſt, is a ſweet way to a zealous man, if it ſhould bring him a moment ſooner then another mean; for, therefore did <hi>Peter</hi> willingly <hi>caſt himſelfe into the ſea.</hi> 7. Affection unto Chriſt doth not warrant men needleſly to caſt away his benefits, or neglect his bountiful providence in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, providing, they omit no diligence to come to Chriſt; for, ſo much doth the practice of the reſt of the Diſciples teach, who indeed <hi>came,</hi> but <hi>dragging the net with the fiſhes.</hi> And this their carriage is juſtified both by Chriſts command, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and <hi>Peters</hi> own practice, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and albeit both he be commendable in his way, and they in theirs, and yet in ſome circumſtances they are contrary to other: Yet theſe may be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, if we mark theſe particulars. 1. Chriſt doth approve of all who ſincerely endeavour to come to him, and who lay no impediments in their own way, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their lawfull employments for a by-end, albeit all be not alike ſpeedy and forward; for, both are approved that they <hi>come,</hi> and they alſo though they come not ſo ſoon as <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe they make no wilf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll delay, but take <hi>a little ſhip</hi> that they might come the ſooner, ſeeing they might hazard in it, being <hi>not far from land,</hi> &amp;c. And their aime in bringing the net with them, was not ſo much to enrich themſelves, as that they might not loſe what providence had brought unto them. 2. The ſincerity, and deſire of Saints to be at Chriſt, is not to be meaſured, by what at ſome-time themſelves or others attain unto; for, this was an extraordinary gale of affection in <hi>Peter,</hi> not at all times attained by himſelfe, and therefore it doth not defame them, who follow the ordinary way of expreſſing affection unto Chriſt in ſuch caſes. 3. Some may the more warrantably expreſſe their affection to Chriſt, by neglecting at ſome time all other affairs, that they have others to do them for them, and ſo they do not miſcarry through their laying them by; for, <hi>Peter</hi> might the more ſafely leave all and come to Chriſt, that there were others ſufficient to bring the draught to land. Otherwiſe it had not been commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him to leave them, and it had been their ſin, if all had done as <hi>Peter</hi> did. Though this alſo muſt be added, that however men have others to do affairs for them, yet that will not warrant them alwaies to neglect a worldly calling, (if that be their ſtation) though at ſometimes
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48148:216"/>
it may. 4. It were ſafe for us to conjoyne both theſe practices, as pointing out our duty, in relation to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and to make <hi>Peters</hi> practice of leaving all, our rule in extraordinary caſes and times, and when we are called to forſake all: As <hi>Peter</hi> had ſome reaſon to be forward now above the reſt, becauſe of his foule fall. And to make their practice our rule in ordinary caſes, and ſo to follow duty and have a care of worldly affairs, as they do not ſinfully retard us from coming unto Chriſt. 5. In our ordinary walking alſo the conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe practices would make compleat Chriſtians; to be like <hi>Peter</hi> in our affections, above, (as no doubt they alſo were) and undervaluing theſe temporary things about which we muſt (notwithſtanding) be neceſſarily taken up, and being ready to abandon and forſake them when called ſo to do, as he did. And to be like them in our outward carriage, conſcientiouſly following duty in obedience to a command.</p>

                  <p>The next conſequent recorded here, is, his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their dineing with him, which they obſerved, when they came to land, and which it ſeems he did by miracle. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt can afford wonders on all hands, where he is, to his people; And it is no ſtrange thing, where he cometh, to ſee wonders and mercies heaped one upon another: for, here, after a miracle at ſea, they meet another mercy miraculouſly provided at land: <hi>Aſſoone then as they were come to land, they ſaw a fire of coales there, and fiſh laid thereon, and bread.</hi> 2. Chriſt delights to prove and manifeſt his God-head and power, in ſhewing kindeneſſe, and letting out needful favours upon his people; for, being to prove his God-head, he chooſeth to give a proofe of it, by giving them food, which now they needed, rather then by any other extraordinary work. 3. Chriſt hath a very tender reſpect to the meaneſt neceſſities of his people, to ſee to the ſupply thereof; Therefore hath he <hi>fiſh and bread</hi> ready for them, who had been at hard labour all night. 4. Albeit Chriſt binde us to the uſe of lawful means; Yet he hath given abundant proofe that he needs none of our diligence to provide for us, but can do it without us; that ſo we may not ceaſe to truſt him, when either we are debarred from the uſe of means, or they do not ſucceed with us: Therefore, albeit he tied them to fiſhing, yet when they come to land, he lets them ſee he can feed them without any of their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>They ſaw a fire of coals there, and fiſh laid thereon, and bread.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third conſequent recorded, is, the diſcovery of the reality and greatneſſe of the miracle wrought for them: Chriſt, before he dine with them, will have the Diſciples (who had come to him, and left net and all ſo ſoon as they got it ſo near the ſhore, as the ſea could not take it away) to bring of the fiſhes they had caught, which they obeying, do finde there were a great many fiſhes, and yet the net not broken, as formerly it had been in the like caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.6. Chriſts end in bidding bring of the fiſhes, was not chiefly for their preſent eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (ſeeing he had already provided for them, <hi>v.</hi> 9.) though it may be, alſo, he allowed this, that their taſt of the fiſh, as well as the ſight of the multitude thereof, might confirme and aſſure them it was a real miracle, and the original Word, here rendred <hi>fiſh,</hi> is not againſt that ſenſe. But his chief end was to feed their mindes with a ſight of the greatneſſe and reality of the miracle, before he fed their bodies; for ſo much doth their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>v.</hi> 11. point out to us. And while this <hi>going up</hi> (to wit, into the ſhip, that he might come at the net) <hi>and drawing the net to land,</hi> is aſcribed unto <hi>Peter</hi> only, it is not to be underſtood, as if he alone did it, but he only is mentioned, becauſe of his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to give obedience, as he had been formerly forward to come to Chriſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give evidence how well he approves of his peoples following of a lawful calling, and that they have a care of their outward enjoyments, in their own place; for, here, his command juſtifieth them who brought the net along with them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. in that when all have left it, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> he bids them <hi>bring of the fiſh;</hi> And <hi>Peter,</hi> by his obedience to the command, doth alſo clear, that he accounted it no cauſe of reproach, that they left it out formerly, as he did. 2. Chriſt is a great eſteemer of peoples diligence and uſing of means, and of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will aſcribe all that he doth for them to their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; that ſo they may be encouraged (not to conceit of it, but) to continue in it; for, albeit he gave them theſe fiſh by miracle, yet in regard of their caſting out the net, and dragging it to land, he aſcribes it all to them, <hi>Bring of the fiſh, which ye have now caught.</hi> 3. When Diſciples have ſeen much of Chriſt in his working, they need yet a more particular obſervation thereof, that they may ſee and conſider his glory more diſtinctly, and they may be affected of new with it, and it may take more deep impreſſion in their mindes: Therefore, albeit they had ſeen and known Chriſt already by this miracle, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. yet for theſe cauſes will he have them <hi>bring of the fiſh,</hi> that they may look again, and more diſtinctly and narrowly upon the miracle. 4. To be taken up with the ſerious and diſtinct obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſts working, is more uſeful and refreſhful to right diſcerners, then to enjoy his bodily preſence, and then bodily refreſhment to hungry men; Therefore, now, when they are in Chriſts company, and are going to dine who (it ſeems) had faſted long, yet Chriſt ſent them away for a time, from himſelfe, and from their meat, to go obſerve the miracle, <hi>Bring of the fiſh, which ye have now caught.</hi> 5. True love, which draws diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to haſten to be at Chriſt, will alſo make them prompt and nimble in obeying his commands; for, as <hi>Peter</hi> was eminent in his haſt to be at Chriſt; ſo now he is noted as eminent in going about what is enjoyned: and therefore he is only named, <hi>Simon Peter went up,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48148:217"/>
and drew the net to land.</hi> 6. As affection to Chriſt will elevate diſciples mindes above the world and the things of it; ſo in their following of a calling, the chief and greateſt beauty that they will ſee in it, is that Chriſt hath commanded it, and therefore they will follow it, but with their heart above it; for, ſo much may we learn from this practice of <hi>Peter,</hi> conjoyned with his former practice, <hi>v.</hi> 7. In the firſt, he gave proof, how far his heart was above theſe things, and here he gives proof how beautiful that ſervice is when commanded by Chriſt. 7. Moſt ſtrict obſervation and enquiry about Chriſts working, will never dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his glory, but will contribute to ſet out more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the greatneſſe of his power and liberality; for, before they only found the net full, ſo that they could not draw it, <hi>v</hi> 6. now they finde diſtinctly that it was <hi>full of great fiſhes,</hi> and not of other traſh, which might have fallen into the net; and particularly, that there were <hi>an hundred and fifty and three.</hi> 8. The more diſtinctly men do conſider Chriſts works, they will only finde them the more wonderful, but they will finde a wonder in a wonder in them; for, beſide the great number of fiſh, it is marked as a new wonder, <hi>and for all there were ſo many, yet was not the net broken,</hi> as it had been in the like caſe formerly, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.6. though the Original word, being the ſame here and there, doth evidence that it was a net of the ſame kinde. Only it is to be marked, that as there the greatneſſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is pointed out by the breaking of the net; ſo here it is amplified from this new wonder, that the net brake not; to teach us, that Chriſt manifeſts his power, ſometime one way, and ſometime another, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and that he will not be limited by us in the way of his working.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Conſequent recorded, is, his inviting them to dine, with their going about it; betwixt which there is interlaced, the Diſciples reverencing of him, who, albeit they had yet ſome ſcruples concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this his ſhewing of himſelf, which his ſpeaking to them, and aſſuring them that it was he, would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have removed; Yet, being perſwaded they were but groundleſſe ſcruples, and that indeed it was the Lord; they do ſo reverence him, as they are aſhamed to trouble him with ſuch queſtions. <hi>Whence learn</hi> 1. Chriſt is very tender even of the bodies of his people, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, (not pampering, but) that they ſhould have a ſober and moderate care of them, as being the Tabernacles of his own Spirit; Therefore is he the firſt motioner of their refreſhing their bodies, <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, Come and dine;</hi> and albeit he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their dinner, till they had ſecured their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and had obſerved their miracle, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 11. yet now he will conferre none with them, till they had dined, <hi>v.</hi> 15. 2. Albeit it be not expreſly ſaid here, that Chriſt did eat with them, as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.42, 43. yet it is implied in this invitation, not <hi>go,</hi> but <hi>Come and dine;</hi> not that he needed meat now, but thereby he would confirme the truth of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; And, as by the former miracle, he proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf true God; ſo by this he would prove that he was true man ſtill, and ſo doth teach us; That our exalted High Prieſt continueth our Kinſman, and bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, ſtill; and that he was going in our nature to take poſſeſſion for us in heaven. 3. Albeit alſo it be not expreſſed that he bleſſed the meat, or gave thanks, yet it is to be underſtood, as his ordinary practice, not only before, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.11. but even ſince his Reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.30, 35. Only it is clear here, that he <hi>giveth it</hi> ſtill, to teach us that our daily bread, and the bleſſing thereof cometh from him, and is to be ſought from him continually. 4. Weak beleevers will not get their doubts and ſcruples ſoon overcome, even when they know they are wrong; for, they <hi>knew, it was the Lord,</hi> and yet they had ſome doubts which would have put them to enquire, <hi>who art thou?</hi> 5. Chriſt is ſo condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to judge of his people by their better part, and to account them knowers and beleevers, who yet have ſome ignorance and doubtings, providing they approve not thereof; for, ſo doth <hi>John</hi> record them, as <hi>knowing that it was the Lord,</hi> though they had theſe doubts. 6. Albeit the beſt way to refute and remove the meaneſt doubt be, to lay it before Chriſt; yet it is a commendable duty, and a teſtimony of reverence to Chriſt, when theſe who get many proofes of his love, are aſhamed to own their unbelief, or to bring it out as a real doubt, when it aſſaults them; but do either ſuppreſſe it, or complain of it as unreaſonable; for, <hi>knowing that it was the Lord, none of the diſciples durſt ask him, Who art thou?</hi> They are aſhamed to own it as a real doubt, but do ſuppreſſe it; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, however they might have complained of it, as their weakneſſe unto Chriſt, yet it had been their ſin, to have given any conſent or way unto it, as this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion would import they had.</p>

                  <p>In the fifth branch of this Narration, Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Peter</hi> is recorded, and that both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, to <hi>v.</hi> 20. and concerning <hi>John, v.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. That which concernes <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, ſeems to have been his ſpecial end in ſhewing himſelf at this time, (as his general end was, to confirme the truth of his Reſurrection;) but that which concerneth <hi>John,</hi> was only occaſionally drawn out by <hi>Peters</hi> curioſity. Chriſts conference concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> conſiſts of two parts. In the firſt whereof, (in theſe verſes) <hi>Peter,</hi> upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his love unto Chriſt, is reſtored unto, and confirmed in his Apoſtolick office and former dignity, which he had forfeited by his foule and groſſe fall. Chriſts threefold queſtion concerning <hi>Peters</hi> love, tends only to draw out a threefold anſwer from <hi>Peter,</hi> and that his profeſſed repentance might be as frequent as his denial. And conſequently, we are not to look upon Chriſts threefold injunction to <hi>Peter,</hi> to feed his lambs and ſheep, as three diſtinct commands, enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers things, but only as one command thrice repeated, upon occaſion of his threefold anſwer. And therefore I ſhall take them together in drawing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, this whole purpoſe, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance thereof upon what precedes, may teach in general, 1. Apoſtacie and denial of Chriſt, though even out of weakneſſe in a time of ſtrait, is a matter full of hazard, and brings diſciples to a loſſe not eaſily recovered; for, <hi>Peter,</hi> by reaſon of his fall, needs a kinde of reſtitution, and a confirmation of new in his office and dignity. And albeit not only he had wept bitterly immediately after his fall, but Chriſt; after his Reſurrection, and before this time, had cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remember him in particular, in that meſſage to the diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.7. and had appeared to him alone, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.34. yea, and had confirmed him in his office with the reſt, when he appeared to all of them, <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22. yet here again he is brought publickly on a ſtage, to teſtifie his repentance before them all. 2. When Chriſt doth put his people on ſervice, and calls for evidences of their love to him, he firſt prevents them with proofes of himſelf, his power, love and care to engage them to their duty; for, this enquiry after <hi>Peters</hi> love, and his engaging him to ſervice, was not till after he had given proof of himſelf by the miracle, and <hi>when they had dined,</hi> and after their bodies were refreſhed by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſts queſtion unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the thrice repeating, and way of propounding it, may teach, 1. Love to Chriſt is the Chriſtians badge, and he is a Run-away who deſerts that Standard; for, by this Chriſt trieth <hi>Peter, Simon, ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me?</hi> 2. Miniſters who are called to take charge of Chriſts children and ſtock, had need of much love to him; no ſervice about them being approven, if it flow not from this, but be undertaken for by-reſpects; and there being no poſſibility without this love, to endure the many blaſts they will meet with from without in their calling, nor the much toile they will have, even with, and from the flock themſelves; Therefore is the enquiry concerning this premitted, <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> as a needful qualification for diſcharge of the truſt committed to him. 3. Whatever love men may warrantably profeſſe they have unto Chriſt, yet it doth not allow them to ſwell in their own eyes becauſe of it, or becauſe of any dignity conferred upon them as lovers of Chriſt; And, Saints in their repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their failings, ſhould look back to the low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from whence Chriſt raiſed them, that they may ſee their ingratitude the more, in back-ſliding or forſaking him; Therefore doth he guard all theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions with this deſignation, <hi>Simon,</hi> not <hi>Peter,</hi> which was the name he gave him, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.42, and, <hi>ſonne of Jonas,</hi> a poor fiſherman, that now he might, in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingt his repentance and renewed love, affect his hear with thoughts of his low eſtate from whence he was exalted, and to which Chriſt might juſtly debaſe him again, and leave him as he found him, <hi>Simon ſon of Jonas:</hi> And that in profeſſing his love, and embracing this charge, he might ſtill remember his Original. 4. The ſenſe of the Lords peoples back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings ſhould be a whet-ſtone to ſharpen their love to Chriſt, and to make them not content to return to a formal way of profeſſion after their foule ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ps, unleſs there be a new edge upon them, to recover their loſſes, and prevent the like failing in time to come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth he enquire particularly at <hi>Peter, loveſt thou me?</hi> as one, who, if he were truly recovered, ought to be eminent in love, and have it more deeply rooted in his heart, that he ſlide not again, and in teſtimony of his ſenſe of Chriſts kindneſſe, who looked upon him after his fall. 5. True repentance ought, and will, not
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48148:218"/>
only be ſincere and real, but as eminent in the effects thereof, as ſinners fall hath been; Therefore doth he poſe him thrice concerning his love, to try if he was real in his Profeſſion, and might indeed ſtand to it, and that his threefold profeſſion of love might be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his threefold denial. 6. Such as have fallen groſſely in an houre of tentation, and have through mercy recovered again, ought yet ſtill to be jealous and ſuſpitious of themſelves, as having groſſely given the lie to their former profeſſions; for, ſo much alſo doth the repetition of theſe queſtions teach, that he would have <hi>Peter</hi> not eaſily truſt himſelf in the like profeſſion, conſidering how well he had ſaid before, when yet he he had done ſo ill. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> takes it, being grieved that it is the third time propounded, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and that he was now become a ſuſpected man, 7. Chriſt at laſt propounds this queſtion with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative qualification, <hi>loveſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> (that is more then any of the reſt do love me,) not ſo much pointing out, that a fallen and reſtored man (as alſo every Saint) ſhould ſtrive to out-ſtrip another in this grace; as reflecting upon his former conceit of himſelf, and his ſingular undertaking, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33. and it may be, alſo, reflecting upon his late forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in coming out of the ſhip, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and trying if, becauſe of that, he would boaſt of any ſingular love to him. And ſo, with the offer of accepting his ſincere love, and his calling for it, he rips up his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of himſelf: and ſo it teacheth, partly, That the evil of Saints apoſtaſies and defections will never be throughly cured, by any returning out of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evil courſe, unleſſe the fountain, cauſe and root of their evils be cured, and continually abhorred and watched over; Therefore Chriſt preſents that to him which had occaſioned his former fall to ſee what he thinks of it, and if it did continue with him; and partly. That Chriſt alloweth his people to ſeaſon their bitter thoughts of their own evils, with the offer of his love and acceptance of what is good and ſincere in them; for, he ſo propounds this indirect challenge, as he guards it with an ofter of his preſent acceptance of his love, which is implied in the queſtion. 8. In the ſecond and third queſtions, <hi>Peter,</hi> having in his anſwer modeſtly declined to make any compariſons, Chriſt omits this qualification, and propounds the queſtion ſimply, <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> To teach, that he covereth and paſſeth by infirmities, when he ſeeth us convinced of them</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as for <hi>Peters</hi> threefold anſwer to theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, we need not curiouſly diſtinguiſh betwixt the word in the queſtion whereby Chriſt expreſſeth love to himſelf, as ſignifying a greater degree of love, and the word uſed by <hi>Peter</hi> in his anſwer, as ſignifying a leſſer degree, and that as he would not compare with others, ſo he would not boaſt of the meaſure of his own love, but profeſſeth ſincere love, though weak. For Chriſt in his third queſtion uſeth that ſame word, wherein <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers. And if any diſtinction ought to be made betwixt the expreſſions, Chriſt by uſing both in his enquiries would teach us, That he takes notice of, and is willing to accept of leſſer degrees of ſincere love, as well as of greater; for, he interrogates concerning both, implying his acceptance of either; and, that even ſuch as are ſober and dare not profeſſe an eminent meaſure of love to Chriſt, but only ſome weak degree of it, had yet need to examine if they be ſincere and real, even in that they profeſſe; and therefore Chriſt, after <hi>Peter</hi> hath changed the word he had uſed into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in the two former Anſwers, will the third time poſe him, if he dare avow the ſincerity and reality of what he profeſſeth. And upon this, it ſeems, <hi>Peter</hi> was grieved, <hi>v.</hi> 17. that not only he had enquired the <hi>third time,</hi> but had alſo called in queſtion that weak meaſure of love he had profeſſed. However it be, as to the force and ſignification of theſe words; yet we may from his Anſwers, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is very poſſible for fallen Saints to recover their feet, and attain to love again; as here <hi>Peters</hi> experience doth teſtifie. 2. A lover of Chriſt indeed may humbly avow his love before him, as often as he enquireth concerning it; as here <hi>Peter</hi> doth thrice, <hi>Yea, Lord, I love thee.</hi> 3. A ſincere lover of Chriſt will, by his falling, be taught ſobriety, and not to boaſt of himſelf above others: for, <hi>Peter</hi> makes no compariſons in anſwer to Chriſts firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſimply ranks himſelf among lovers of him, <hi>Lord, I love thee.</hi> 4. They who would prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lovers of Chriſt indeed, muſt not only ſatisfie and pleaſe themſelves in the matter, but ſhould appeal to his knowledge, and be ſure that he knowes and approves of them as ſuch; for, ſaith he, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> 5. Such as would approve themſelves unto Chriſt, ought to look upon him as knowing all things, and that therefore he will not be deceived with any ſhewes; for, ſo much doth <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſe in his third Anſwer, <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> 6. Our ſight of the grace of God in us, after our back-ſlidings, ſhould be joyned with the ſenſe of out falling; for, the third time, <hi>Peter was grieved,</hi> whereby (not to ſpeak of any failing in him, by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at what Chriſt did) Chriſt would put him in minde how his former ſliding had juſtly rendred him ſuſpected, that his profeſſion of love might be joyned with ſenſible thoughts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſts charge put upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and thrice repeated, may teach, 1. Chriſt may make good uſe of Saints who fall foully in an houre of tentation, and may raiſe them up again, to do him eminent ſervice in their generation; for, fallen <hi>Peter</hi> is again entruſted with the charge of his <hi>ſheep and lambes.</hi> 2. Saints love to Chriſt cannot extend to him, but he aſſignes it all to his people, that who ſo love him, may ſhew kindneſs to them in their ſtation; for, upon <hi>Peters</hi> profeſſion of love to him, he enjoynes him, <hi>feed my lambs,</hi> as the notable proof of it, and as reckoning that it ſhould be a great evidence of love to him, to have a care of them. 3. Miniſters ought to look upon Chriſts peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as very ſeriouſly recommended to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould very ſeriouſly mind their work about them; for, therefore is this charge thrice laid on <hi>Peter,</hi> that he may minde it much. 4. Such as would be faithful in a Miniſterial charge, ought to look upon the people of their charge, as Chriſts in a near relation, loved of him, committed to their charge by him, and to be gained to him; Therefore doth he in this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on call them, <hi>my lambs, my ſheep.</hi> 5. Miniſters ought alſo to look upon the variety of tempers, and degrees of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48148:218"/>

It is a great part of Miniſters work, to feed Chriſts people with ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine; and ſo to diſpenſe it, as to condeſcend to the capacity of the weakeſt; for, in the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he is to <hi>feed,</hi> or afford food, and that even to the <hi>lambs.</hi> 7. It is not ſufficient that Miniſters be able to feed, unleſſe they alſo govern and rule the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, and do every other duty of a a good ſhepherd unto them; And even the ſtrongeſt ought to ſubject themſelves unto this Government; for, in the ſecond repetition of the charge it is, <hi>feed,</hi> or <hi>govern,</hi> and <hi>play the ſhepherd</hi> (for the word is different from the former) and that even to the <hi>ſheep.</hi> 8. The ſtrongeſt of profeſſours will not, within time, attain that height of perfection and ſanctity, as to out-grow Ordinances or a Miniſtry, or not to need them; and Miniſters are bound to deal with them accordingly; Therefore, in the third repetition of the charge, he uſeth the word firſt uſed, <hi>feed,</hi> or provide and afford food, and that even to <hi>my ſheep,</hi> as well as to lambs.</p>

                  <p>In the next part of Chriſts conference with <hi>Peter,</hi> he warnes him of his future ſufferings, promiſing that he ſhould prove more ſtout then in his former trial. This he propounds more darkly, <hi>v.</hi> 18. and alluding to the cuſtome of theſe Eaſterne people, who, wearing long garments, did gird them up by binding their loines when they went to a journey; and to the cuſtome of binding malefactours, when they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from place to place, or to the place of execution) He ſheweth a great difference that ſhould be betwixt his caſe in youth and in old age. In his youth, he girded up his loines, and walked at his own pleaſure, but in his old age, others ſhould binde him, and carry him, whether his natural inclination did not lead him. And in <hi>v.</hi> 19. he explains this, ſhewing that he ſpake of his violent death, ſweetning it with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that hereby he ſhould glorifie God, and commanding him preſently to follow him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Love to Chriſt muſt be evidenced, not only by active doing of duty, but by ſuffering alſo unto death, if we be called unto it; And Miniſters eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when they undertake the charge of Chriſts flock, ought to lay their account for ſuch a lot: Therefore is this prediction joyned with the former injunction, as another proof of <hi>Peters</hi> love to Chriſt. 2. The matter of ſuffering would not be lightly thought upon, but we ſhould have grave and ſerious thoughts of it, that afflictions in ſome meaſure abide us, that it is our duty to reſolve for the worſt, and that ſuffering will indeed try us, and therefore we ſhould be laying up for ſuch a ſtrait; for theſe cauſes doth he begin this doctrine with a grave aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> 3. There will be great difference betwixt a Saint truſting in his own ſtrength, and the ſame Saint leaning upon, and ſupported by God; he who before durſt not look a damoſel in the face, will in the other caſe, dare to look death in the face; for, ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Peter,</hi> of whom Chriſt foretels this, when he is minding him of his former failing. 4. As it is the duty of Saints alwayes to look on ſuffering for Chriſt as their great honour, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. ſo in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, when a Saint is indeed penitent for his ſhifting of ſuffering, and ſliding in a time of trial, it will be his great comfort to know that he ſhall have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſuffer, and be born through in it; that (ſo to ſay) he may be avenged on trial for his two eyes; for, here it is held out for <hi>Peters</hi> encouragement, that Chriſt will employ him, who had proven ſo weak, yet to ſuffer unto death for his Name; as a ſouldier who is ſhamefully beaten, deſires nothing ſo much as another day, wherein he may ſhew his valour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his credit. 5. As nature hath an antipathy at death, and particularly, a violent death; ſo Saints have not an inclination to ſuffering, ready to let out at their pleaſure, till God give them victory and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; Therefore is his ſuffering called <hi>anothers gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, him, and carrying him whither he would not;</hi> not only ſhewing that naturally he would be averſe from it, or, that he would have no hand in his own ſuffering and death, but that, take him in his own reſolutions and inclinations, and he would decline ſuch a lot, though grace made him ſubmit, and <hi>ſtretch out his hands,</hi> that they might gird him, and this ſheweth, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is that the moſt reſolute of men do ſeek willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from Chriſt, leſt their natural inclinations prevail; And, that even where there is a natural antipathy and fear of death and ſuffering, yet Chriſt may make emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and reſolute Martyrs of them, they depending on him, as many Martyrs who have been long exerciſed with the feare of death, have found in experience. 6. The thing which nature, eſpecially while men are young and in vigour would ſtill be at; is to be their own Maſters, not ſubject to the Law of God, nor to the toſſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences about the world: for, this was <hi>Peters</hi> way, and what he delighted in then, <hi>when thou waſt young, thou girded thy ſelf, and walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt:</hi> He was his own man, and delighted to walk as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and at randome and liberty. 7. Men may expect ſtrange changes in their lots and exerciſes, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turnes of their life, before they go off the world; and particularly, when men engage themſelves in Chriſts ſervice, they may expect a ſtrange change to follow on it; Not only will their conſciences within them curb their extravigant and lawleſſe walking, but whereas there were none before to trouble them, now there muſt be nothing but bonds and death for them. So much doth this oppoſition betwixt <hi>Peters</hi> lot, in his youth, and old age, teach us. <hi>When thou waſt young, thou girdedſt
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48148:219"/>
thy ſelf, &amp;c. But when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy bands, &amp;c.</hi> 8. That Chriſt promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he ſhall not ſuffer till he be <hi>old;</hi> He teacheth, partly, that the timing of his peoples ſuffering is in his hand, and he can, when he pleaſeth, give them a faire time, wherein to ſerve him, before he call them to ſeal the truth by their ſufferings; for, <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>old</hi> before they <hi>gird him, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31, 32. and partly, That Chriſt may call his people to ſuffer, when their viſible ability is leaſt, that ſo the power car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them through may be ſeen to be of him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth he ſuffer when he is <hi>old,</hi> when albeit old age might quench many luſts in him, and experience and time might ſettle him, yet his natural vigour was decayed; and feares, uſually accompanying old age, might retard him. 9. Chriſt would have his doctrine diſtinctly taken up and underſtood by hearers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood this well enough, ſo <hi>John</hi> explains it for our uſe, ſhewing that Chriſt ſpake of <hi>Peters death,</hi> in theſe termes. 10. The ſufferings of Saints do contribute to ſet out the glory of God; the glory of the truth of the Word, when they are ready to ſeal it with their blood, and to ſtand to the defence thereof unto death; The glory of the truth, and riches of his promiſes, and of eternal life held out therein, when they hazard on the enmity and oppoſition of all, and on death it ſelf, in the faith and hope thereof, and do look on eternal life as ſufficient to compenſe all their loſſes; and, The glory of his excellency and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, when they count all things but vanity and loſſe, that they may pleaſe him, and ſo they proclaim their faith to be richly made up in him; therefore, ſaith he, that by <hi>his death he ſhould glorifie God.</hi> 11. The conſideration that God is glorified by any lot, ſhould put a lovely face upon it, were it even ſuffering a violent death to Saints; Therefore is this propounded as the lovely ſight of his ſuffering, that hereby <hi>he ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 12.28. 12. Saints ought to give proof of their ſincere reſolutions for ſufferings, by their cloſe following of Chriſt in their preſent ſervice; Therefore doth Chriſt ſubjoyne, <hi>And when he had ſpoken this, he ſaith unto him, Follow me.</hi> Where it appears from <hi>v.</hi> 20. that Chriſt roſe from the reſt of the company, and went away, when he gave this command. And this he did, not ſo much for any preſent journey, as by calling him to obey this preſent command, to leave all his enjoyments and company, and follow him whereever he goeth, he takes proof of his ſincerity, and whether he is reſolved indeed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in ſuffering, when he ſhall be called to it, and would have him begin to practiſe that leſſon in time, that he might be the more fit for it, when it came to a puſh: and ſo we will finde it made uſe of, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 13. It is the duty of ſuch as would either ſerve or ſuffer for Chriſt, to make him their pattern and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in what is imitable; and it is their encouragement, and may ſweeten their way, that he hath gone before them: Therefore alſo bids he him, <hi>follow me,</hi> to point out, not ſo much his duty of preſent going after him, as thereby to ſignifie his duty to imitate Chriſt in all his actions, particularly, in his care of his ſheep, and reſolution for ſuffering; and to hold out this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and how it might be ſweet to follow him.</p>

                  <p>In theſe verſes we have Chriſts conference with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> concerning <hi>John</hi> the beloved diſciple: wherein is recorded, that after Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> had left the reſt of the company, <hi>John</hi> of his own accord did follow on; which <hi>Peter</hi> turning back and obſerving, he enquires at Chriſt, (who had foretold of his own ſufferings) what ſhould become of <hi>John.</hi> For which he is checked by Chriſt, as medling with that which concerned him not, and he ſheweth him, that although it ſhould pleaſe him, not only to exempt <hi>John</hi> from ſuffering death, but to continue him alive till his own ſecond coming, it ought not at all to retard him in his reſolutions, and therefore he commands him to follow him, and cleave to his duty, which by this means he had neglected. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Much love to Chriſt, and much of the ſenſe of his love, will make a man an earneſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer after Chriſt, and to cleave to him, even when Chriſt ſeemes to take no notice of him; Therefore <hi>John</hi> followed, when Chriſt had bidden only <hi>Peter</hi> follow him, and when it ſeems the reſt did not ſtirre; and in this he is deſcribed to be <hi>the diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> one who had been very familiar with Chriſt, and <hi>leaned on his breaſt at ſupper,</hi> and very inquiſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſts ſafety, <hi>and ſaid, Lord, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</hi> (of all which, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 13.23.) and therefore he could not ſtay behinde. 2. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord are ſubject to many diſtractions and interruptions in following their Chriſtian courſse, and do often look, or turn aſide, and intermit their earneſt eyeing of their mark and prize; for, when <hi>Peter</hi> is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den follow Chriſt at this time, hereby to teach him, cloſely to follow his calling, and ſet his heart and eye upon it, and what he was to meet with, (as the check and repetition of that command in this verſe doth teach us) he <hi>turned about,</hi> to look to ſomewhat behind him, and that either meerly of his own accord, or becauſe he had heard ſome noiſe of one following. See <hi>Luke</hi> 9.62. 3. Albeit the intermiſſions of the children of God in their duty may ſeem very little and ſmall; yet oft-times it caſts them upon ſnares and tentations, which are ready to catch and detain them more, and ſo draw out reproofs from Chriſt; for, <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>turning about, ſeeth the diſciple whom Jeſus loved, following,</hi> and this occaſions his curious queſtion, and draweth out a reproof, not only for his looking back, but for his curioſity. 4. Chriſt abhorreth curioſity in his people, and that when they have ſo much needful exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their hands, yet they ſhould meddle more with what concerneth them not ſo much; for, when <hi>Peter</hi> propounds this queſtion, <hi>and what ſhall this man do?</hi>
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:48148:219"/>
or, <hi>and what this man?</hi> that is, what ſhall become of him, (as Chriſts anſwer makes it clear) he gets this anſwer, <hi>what is that to thee? follow thou me,</hi> Not that Chriſt condemnes ſollicitude for our brethren, which floweth from charity, but that he is ill pleaſed with his idle curioſity, when now he had received a ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to follow him. 5. It is a ſin to be anxious, or too much careful about what Chriſt will do with his beloved people; for, ſo much alſo doth Chriſts reproofe of his enquiry concerning the beloved diſciple, import, that it was weakneſſe in <hi>Peter</hi> to be any way troubled concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. 6. Chriſt hath ſoveraigne authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his own, and to keep them longer or ſhorter time in the world, and give them eaſe or trouble, as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, without giving an account of his dealing to any; for, ſaith he, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> Wherein there is no hint given that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not ſuffer, and that he ſhould live long, and till Chriſt ſhould come by his judgements againſt the Nation of the Jewes (though theſe proved true in the event) but it is only an abſolute ſuppoſition, that if Chriſt pleaſed to preſerve him alive, even till his ſecond coming, or otherwiſe diſpoſed of him at his pleaſure, Neither <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other, had any thing to ſay to it. 7. As Chriſt will come again, ſo the ſweet notion under which Saints ſhould take up the laſt and dreadful day, is, that Chriſt will then come again unto them; for, ſo doth Chriſt here point out that day, <hi>I come,</hi> See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17. 8. It is the duty of Saints, not to compare the Lords dealing with themſelves and others, ſo as to be thereby withdrawn from, or diſcouraged in, their own duty and lot; for, whereas <hi>Peter</hi> might think it ſtrange if he only were called to ſuffering, Chriſt takes him off looking to his dealing with <hi>John,</hi> and bids him minde his own work, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</hi> Such compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (however ſometime they may ſharpen us, and afford matter of praiſe, yet) do oft-times breed many inconveniences. For we are naturally inclined to be diſcontent with our own condition, and to think that beſt which we want, and ſo will more readily be grieved if we got a harder lot then others; whereas Chriſt hath variety of ſervices, and may lay them on as he pleaſeth: And beſide, Such compariſons may, oft-times, tempt men to ſit up from duty, when they ſee the ſecurity of others. 9. Such as would avoid curioſity, and much needleſſe and vain exerciſe, ought cloſely to follow their own work and calling; Therefore, doth Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from all theſe enquiries, by bidding him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>follow thou me.</hi>

pleaſed the Lord not to overcharge the Church with an infinite Narration, which he expreſſeth in an hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke tearme, which imports this much, that the books which might be written of this ſubject would burthen and overcharge the world, and mens judgements and memories could not overtake or retain the Narration of all particular paſſages. This acknowledgement of <hi>John, that there are many other things which Jeſus did,</hi> and yet are not written, being extended generally to paſſages in his whole miniſtry, is to be underſtood with the Rules, and according to the caveats, mentioned on <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.30, 31. and as nothing derogatory to the perfection of Scriptures in the matters of faith and manners, which is there aſſerted, notwithſtanding theſe things are omitted. For albeit a great many of Chriſts miracles in the courſe of his miniſtry (which properly are to be underſtood <hi>by things that Jeſus did</hi>) be not recorded; yet neither will that argue that any point of doctrine is omitted, nor yet that the doctrine is not ſufficiently confirmed to us by the miracles that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and by their declaring that there were yet many moe. Yea, ſuppoſe it be granted that many particular conferences and Sermons which Chriſt had in the courſe of his Miniſtry, are not written, yet it will not follow that the ſumme of theſe, and of all his doctrine, is not recorded in what is written. But on the contrary, the wiſdome of God chooſed to comprehend all that was needful, in a brief ſumme, (even of the Sermons that are recorded) for the eaſe and benefit of the Church. And as for them, who upon theſe expreſſions would gather that many things needful to ſalvation are not to be found in Scriptures, but to be ſought out of unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions; I would have them, before they aſſert ſuch a thing, reſolve theſe queſtions, for the ſatisfaction of the Church, in this great article ſo nearly concerning her. 1. If the pen-men of the Spirit of God have taken pen from paper, accounting that ſufficient which they have written, how dare they undertake that task which thoſe have given over? 2. If theſe things not written be alike neceſſary with what is written, what reaſon can be given to any unbyaſſed perſon, why the Lord ſhould cauſe write the one, and yet leave the other to uncertain Tradition, and the fraile and corrupt memories of men? 3. If the Lord was not pleaſed to write them, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them by Tradition, (as they do not only aſſert, but pretend grave and weighty reaſons why the Lord did ſo) Upon what ground do they preſume at all to ſtuffe their writings with them, and do not leave them as he left them? 4. If all theſe be neceſſary to ſalvation, and yet <hi>the world could not contain the books that ſhould be written</hi> of them, were they written, how ſhall they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct that they have marked them all? and how will they ſatisfie the Church that ſhe hath yet a perfect rule, of Scripture and all the Traditions they have recorded, being put together? 5. With what face can they, upon this pretext, obtrude Traditions upon the Church which are not only beſide, but clearly contrary unto the written Word of God, as if the Spirit of God did contradict himſelfe? The truth is, <hi>John</hi> cloſeth with this, becauſe what he had written was ſufficient, and the reſt not poſſible to be overtaken, nor yet neceſſary to be recorded for the uſe of the Church in all ages, though they were neceſſary for the time, and it be uſeful for us to know there were many ſuch things, though they be not particularly recorded; as is marked on <hi>chap.</hi> 20.31, 32.</p>
                  <p>From this purpoſe, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. This Goſpel was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, who being employed by Chriſt as a meet pen-man of ſuch ſublime doctrine, did out of love and duty write ſo ſweetly of Chriſt; and hereby gives us occaſion to try what love, ſuch a meſſage, by ſuch a pen-man, doth produce; for, <hi>This is the Diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things.</hi> 2. All this Narration is of divine truth, whatever we think of it, and whatever many do eſteem of it and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Yet it wants not witneſſes who were eye and ear witneſſes, and fully perſwaded, to aſſert the truth of it; for, ſaith he, <hi>we know,</hi> (ſpeaking of himſelfe in the plural number, or of himſelfe with the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) <hi>that his teſtimony is true.</hi> 3. It is the duty of Miniſters to aſſert the truth of their doctrine, and to ſet to (as it were) their Meſſengers ſeal to Chriſts truth which they publiſh, for their own exoneration, and for the encouragement of beleevers, and as a witneſſe againſt all who receive it not; Therefore, doth <hi>John</hi> call all his doctrine, <hi>his teſtimony,</hi> and aſſerts that <hi>we know that his teſtimony is true.</hi> 4. It is impoſſible to get all ſaid which might be ſaid of Chriſt, and to his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, ſo doth <hi>John</hi> aſſert, that <hi>if the things which Jeſus did, ſhould be written, every one, even the world it ſelfe could not contain the books which ſhould be written.</hi> And this may not only point out his excellency and the weakneſſe of our judgements and memories, but whereas our curioſity is ſtill deſirous to hear and know more, this breaking off may call us back rather to ſee how we practice what it hath pleaſed him to record. 5. The Lord, in writing Scripture, hath been pleaſed only to give us a ſhort ſumme of the doctrine preached by Chriſt, and his ſervants, and an account of a part only of the miracles wrought by Chriſt; That ſo he might ſhew his reſpect to our infirmity and weakneſſe, and might take away all excuſe from the lazie and negligent, by compriſing his minde and will in ſo little bulk; for, therefore is <hi>John</hi> directed only to record this much, and to omit the reſt which could not be overtaken. 6. This whole Goſpel is divine truth, worthy to be embraced and received by faith, and that we ſet our ſeal to the truth of it, and feed upon it accordingly; Therefore doth <hi>John</hi> cloſe all, ſetting his <hi>Amen</hi> to this doctrine. <hi>Unto him that loved us, and waſhed us, from our ſins in his blood and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Rev. 1.5, 6,</p>
