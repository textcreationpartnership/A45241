1. AN EXPOSITION Of the GOSPEL of Jeſus Chriſt According to JOHN

    _ The ARGUMENT.
Verſe 1. IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.In the firſtVer. 2. The ſame was in the beginning with God.John doth here repeat and conjoyne the two firſt aſſeVer. 3. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.John havinVer. 4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.A further manifeſtation of Chriſt, and prVer. 5. And the light ſhineth in darkneſſe, and the darkneſſe comprehended it not.A further proof ofVer. 6. There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was John.7. The ſame came for a witneſſe, to beareVer. 8. He was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſſe of that light.9. That was the true lighVer. 10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.11. He came Ver. 12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſonnes of God, even to theVer. 14. And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us (and we beheld his glory, as the glory ofVer. 15. John bare witneſſe of him, and cried, ſaying, This was he of whom I ſpake, He that cometh aVer. 16. And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.In the next branch of this comVer. 17. For the Law was given by Moſes; but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.In the third brancVer. 18. No man hath ſeene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the boſome of the Ver. 19. And this is the record of John, when the Jewes ſent Prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem, to Ver. 22. Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou, that we may give an anſwer to them that ſent us? WhaVer. 24. And they which were ſent were of the Phariſees.25. And they asked him, and ſaid unto him, WVerſe 28. Theſe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.Unto this teſtVerſe 29. The next day John ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him, and ſaith, Behold, the Lamb of God, which tVer. 30. This is he, of whom I ſaid, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was Ver. 31. And I know him not: but that he ſhould be made manifeſt unto Iſrael, therefore am I come baVer. 32. And John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven like a dove, and it aVer. 35. Again the next day after, John ſtood, and two of his diſciples.36. And looking upon Jeſus aVer. 37. And the two Diſciples heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus.38. Then Jeſus turned and ſaVer. 40. One of the two which heard John ſpeak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.4Ver. 43. The day following, Jeſus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and ſaith unto hiVerſe 45. Philip findeth Nathaneel, and ſaith unto him, We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law aVerſe 47. Jeſus ſaw Nathaneel coming to him, and ſaith of him, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom iVerſe 50. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-treeVer. 1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jeſus was thereVer. 3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jeſus ſaith unto him. They have no wine.4. Jeſus ſaVer. 5. His mother ſaith unto the ſervants, Whatſoever he ſayth unto you do it.Secondly; by way of pVerſe 6. And there were ſet there ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of theVerſe 9. When the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence iVerſe 11. This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22. When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1. THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewes.2. The ſame came toVer. 3. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne agaVer. 4. Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond timeVer. 5. Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be borne of water and of the SpVer. 6. That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.ChVer. 7. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again.8. The winde bloweth where it liſtetVerſe 9. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?10. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid uVerſe 11. Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17. For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world througVerſe 18. He that beleeveth on him is not condemned, but he that beleeveth not is condemned already,Verſe 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

darkneſſe Verſe 20. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, left his deedsVerſe 22. After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: fromVerſe 13. Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt again.14Verſe 15. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, nor come hither to dVerſe 16. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come hither.17. The woman anſwered, and ſaiVer. 19. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.20. Our fathers worſhippeVerſe 21. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mouVerſe 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jewes.In theVerſe 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37. And herein is that ſaying true: One ſoweth, and another reapeth.38. I ſent you to reap thaVerſe 39. And many of the Samaritanes of that City beleeved on him for the ſaying of the woman, whicVerſe 43. Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares.6. When Jeſus ſVer 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk.9. And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22. For the Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne.A ſecond inVerſe 23. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth noVerſe 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me,Verſe 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear tVerſe 26. For as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſeVerſe 27. And hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.To coVerſe 28. Marvel not at this: for the houre is coming, in the which all that are in the graves, ſhalVerſe 30. I can of mine own ſelf do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is juſt, becauſe I Verſe 31. If bear witneſſe of my ſelf, my witneſſe is not true.Followeth to the end of the chapter tVerſe 32. There is another that beareth witneſſe of me, and I know that the witneſſe which he witneſVerſe 33. Ye ſent unto John, and he bare witneſſe unto the truth.The firſt particular witneſſe produVerſe 34. But I receive not teſtimony from man: but theſe things I ſay that ye might be ſaved.Unto tVerſe 35. He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his lVerſe 36. But I have greater witneſſe then that of John; for the works which the Father hath given mVerſe 37. And the Father himſelfe which hath ſent me, hath borne witneſſe of me. Ye have neither heaVerſe 39. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which Verſe 40. And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.Unto theſe teſtimonies Chriſt ſubjoynethVerſe 41. I receive not honour from men.Leſt they ſhould think that in commending himſelf, and chaleVerſe 42. But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.A ſecond fault (and a cauſe of thVerſe 43. I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receive me not: if another ſhall come in his own nameVerſe 44. How can ye beleeve, which receive honour one of another; and ſeek not the honour that comeVerſe 45. Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father: there is one that accuſeth you, even MoVerſe 46. For had ye beleeved Moſes, ye would have beleeved me, for he wrote of me.Chriſt confirmethVerſe 47. But if ye beleeve not his writings, how ſhall ye beleeve my words?Chriſt cloſeth this chalVerſe. 1. AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him.9. There is a lad here wVerſe 10. And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſſe in the place. So the men Verſe 11. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, Verſe 12. When they were filled he ſaid unto his Diſciples, gather up the fragments that remaine, thVerſe 14. Then thoſe men when they had ſeene the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth thVerſe 15. When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take

him by force, to make him a Verſe 16. And when even was now come, his diſciples went down unto the Sea.17. And entred into a ſhiVerſe 19. So when they had rowed about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking oVerſe 21. Then they willingly received him into the ſhip, and immediately the ſhip was at the land wVerſe. 22. The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that theVerſe 26. Jeſus anſwered them, and ſaid; Verily, verily I ſay unto you, Ye ſeek me, not becauſe ye ſVerſe 27. Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſtingVerſe 28. Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might worke the workes of God?29. JeſusVerſe 30. They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee, and beleeve tVerſe 32. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread fVer. 33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.InVerſe 34. Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36. But I ſaid unto you, that ye alſo have ſeen me, and beleeve not.In this ver. Chriſt doth ſVerſe 37. All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wVerſe 38. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.39.Verſe 41. The Jewes then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaveVerſe 43 Jeſus therefore anſwered, and ſaid unto them, murmure not among your ſelves.44. No man can Verſe 45. It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God. Every man therefore thVer. 46. Not that any man hath ſeen the Father, ſave he which is of God, he hath ſeen the Father.In Verſe 47. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that beleeveth on me, hath everlaſting life.Chriſt haviVerſe 48. I am the bread of life.Next, Chriſt repeats his former doctrine, and confirmes the former Verſe 49. Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56. He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.A ſecond motiVerſe 57. As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo, he that eateth me, even hVerſe 58. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eate Manna and areVer. 60. Many therefore of his diſciples, when they had heard this, ſaid, This is an hard ſaying, whVerſe 61. When Jeſus knew in himſelfe that his diſciples murmured at it, he ſaid unto them, Doth thiVerſe 62.What and if ye ſhall ſee the Sonne of man aſcend up where he was before.In this and the folVerſe 63. It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1. AFter theſe things, Jeſus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jury, becauſe the JeweVerſe 2. Now the Jewes feaſt of Tabernacles was at hand.3. His brethren therefore ſaid unto him, DepVerſe 6. Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is alway ready.7. The worVerſe 10. But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16. Jeſus anſwered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.Followeth Chriſts replyVerſe 17. If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whetheVerſe 19. Did not Moſes give you the Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law? Why go ye about to kiVerſe 20. The people anſwered and ſaid, Thou haſt a devil, who goeth about to kill thee?Chriſt is inVerſe 21. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.22. Moſes therVerſe 24. Judge not according to the appearance; but judge righteous judgement.Unto this argument ChVerſe 25. Then ſaid ſome of them of Hieruſalem, is not this he whom they ſeek to kill?26. But loe, hVerſe 28. Then cryed Jeſus in the Temple as he taught, ſaying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence IVerſe 30. Then they ſought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet cVer. 31. And many of the people beleeved on him and ſaid, When Chriſt commeth, will he do moe miraclVerſe 32. The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him: And the PhariſeesVerſe 33. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go unto him that ſVer. 35. Then ſaid the Jewes among themſelves, Whither will he go, that we ſhall not finde him? WillVerſe 37. In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus stood, and cried, ſaying, If any man tVer. 38. He that beleeveth on me as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of lVerſe 39. (But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him, ſhould receive, For the Ver. 40. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this ſaying, ſaid, Of a truth this is the ProVerſe 45. Then came the officers to the chiefe Prieſts and Phariſees, and they ſaid unto them, Why hVerſe 47. Then anſwered them the Phariſees, Are ye alſo deceived?48. Have any of the Rulers, or of tVer. 50. Nicodemus ſaith unto them, (He that came to Jeſus by night, being one of them.)51. Doth ourVerſe 52. They anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Art thou alſo of Galilee? Search and look: for out of GaVer. 1. JEſus went unto the mount of Olives:2. And early in the morning he came againe into the TempVerſe 3. And the Scribes and Phariſees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery, and when they hadVer. 6.—But Jeſus ſtooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them notVerſe 10. When Jeſus had lift up himſelfe, and ſaw none but the woman, he ſaid unto her, Woman, wherVerſe 12. Then ſpake Jeſus again unto them, ſaying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth mVerſe 13. The Phariſees therefore ſaid unto him, thou beareſt record of thy ſelf, thy record is not Verſe 15. Ye judge after the fleſh, I judge no man.Before Chriſt produce any farther proof of the trVer. 16, And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſentVerſe. 19. Then ſaid they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jeſus anſwered, Yee neither know me nor my Ver. 20. Theſe words ſpake Jeſus in the treaſury, as he taught in the Temple, and no man laid hands Ver. 21. Then ſaid Jeſus againe unto them, I go my way, and ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall die in your Ver. 22. Then ſaid the Jews; will he kill himſelfe? becauſe he ſaith, Whither I go ye cannot come.InVerſe 23. And he ſaid unto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world: I am noVerſe 25. Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou? And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Even the ſame that I ſaidVerſe 26. I have many things to ſay, and to judge of you: but he that ſent me is true: And I ſpake uVer. 27. They underſtood not that he ſpake to them of the Father.28. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them. WhenVer. 30. As he ſpake thoſe words, many beleeved on him.31. Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jewes which beleVerſe 33. They anſwered him, We be Abrahams ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man, how ſayeſt tVerſe 34. Jeſus anſwered them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Whoſoever committeth ſinne, is the ſeVer. 37. I know that ye are Abrahams ſeed, but ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my word hath no place in Verſe 39. They anſwered and ſaid unto him, Abraham is our father. Jeſus ſaith unto them, If ye were Verſe 41. — Then ſaid they to him, we be not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God.The JVerſe 42. Jeſus ſaid unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, anVerſe 43. Why do ye not underſtand my ſpeech? even becauſe ye cannot heare my word.This chalenge mayVerſe 44. Ye are of your father the devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do: he was a murdereVer. 45. And becauſe I tell you the truth, ye beleeve me not.Here Chriſt doth confirme his aſſertionVer. 46. Which of you convinceth me of ſin? And if I ſay the truth, why do ye not beleeve me?In the Ver. 47. He that is of God, heareth Gods words: ye therefore heare them not, becauſe ye are not of GVerſe 48. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, anVer. 49.

When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſate down in the judgeVerſe 16. — And they took Jeſus, and led him away.17. And he bearing his Croſſe, went forth into a pVerſe 19. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the Croſſe, And the writing was, JESƲS OF NAZARETHVerſe 23.

This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22.

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27.

He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37.

Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5.

Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8.

And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18.

Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20.

And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68.

Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16.

The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him: And the PhariſeesVerſe 33. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go unto him that ſVer. 35.

Many of the people therefore, when they heard this ſaying, ſaid, Of a truth this is the ProVerſe 45.

That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.ChVer. 7. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again.8. The winde bloweth where it liſtetVerſe 9. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?10. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid uVerſe 11. Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17. For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world througVerſe 18. He that beleeveth on him is not condemned, but he that beleeveth not is condemned already,Verſe 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: fromVerſe 13. Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt again.14Verſe 15. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, nor come hither to dVerſe 16. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come hither.17. The woman anſwered, and ſaiVer. 19. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.20. Our fathers worſhippeVerſe 21. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mouVerſe 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jewes.In theVerſe 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37. And herein is that ſaying true: One ſoweth, and another reapeth.38. I ſent you to reap thaVerſe 39. And many of the Samaritanes of that City beleeved on him for the ſaying of the woman, whicVerſe 43. Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares.6. When Jeſus ſVer 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk.9. And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22. For the Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne.A ſecond inVerſe 23. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth noVerſe 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me,Verſe 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear tVerſe 26. For as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſeVerſe 27. And hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.To coVerſe 28.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him.9. There is a lad here wVerſe 10. And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſſe in the place. So the men Verſe 11. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, Verſe 12. When they were filled he ſaid unto his Diſciples, gather up the fragments that remaine, thVerſe 14. Then thoſe men when they had ſeene the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth thVerſe 15. When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take

So when they had rowed about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking oVerſe 21. Then they willingly received him into the ſhip, and immediately the ſhip was at the land wVerſe. 22. The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that theVerſe 26.

Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might worke the workes of God?29. JeſusVerſe 30. They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee, and beleeve tVerſe 32. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread fVer. 33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.InVerſe 34. Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36.

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.39.Verſe 41. The Jewes then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaveVerſe 43 Jeſus therefore anſwered, and ſaid unto them, murmure not among your ſelves.44. No man can Verſe 45.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16.

And this is the record of John, when the Jewes ſent Prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem, to Ver. 22. Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou, that we may give an anſwer to them that ſent us? WhaVer. 24. And they which were ſent were of the Phariſees.25. And they asked him, and ſaid unto him, WVerſe 28. Theſe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.Unto this teſtVerſe 29. The next day John ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him, and ſaith, Behold, the Lamb of God, which tVer. 30.

And John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven like a dove, and it aVer. 35. Again the next day after, John ſtood, and two of his diſciples.36. And looking upon Jeſus aVer. 37. And the two Diſciples heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus.38. Then Jeſus turned and ſaVer. 40. One of the two which heard John ſpeak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.4Ver. 43. The day following, Jeſus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and ſaith unto hiVerſe 45. Philip findeth Nathaneel, and ſaith unto him, We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law aVerſe 47. Jeſus ſaw Nathaneel coming to him, and ſaith of him, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom iVerſe 50. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-treeVer. 1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jeſus was thereVer. 3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jeſus ſaith unto him. They have no wine.4. Jeſus ſaVer. 5. His mother ſaith unto the ſervants, Whatſoever he ſayth unto you do it.Secondly; by way of pVerſe 6. And there were ſet there ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of theVerſe 9. When the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence iVerſe 11. This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22. When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1. THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewes.2. The ſame came toVer. 3. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne agaVer. 4. Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond timeVer. 5. Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be borne of water and of the SpVer. 6. That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.ChVer. 7. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again.8. The winde bloweth where it liſtetVerſe 9. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?10. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid uVerſe 11. Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17. For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world througVerſe 18. He that beleeveth on him is not condemned, but he that beleeveth not is condemned already,Verſe 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: fromVerſe 13. Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt again.14Verſe 15. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, nor come hither to dVerſe 16. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come hither.17. The woman anſwered, and ſaiVer. 19. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.20. Our fathers worſhippeVerſe 21. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mouVerſe 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jewes.In theVerſe 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37. And herein is that ſaying true: One ſoweth, and another reapeth.38. I ſent you to reap thaVerſe 39. And many of the Samaritanes of that City beleeved on him for the ſaying of the woman, whicVerſe 43. Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares.6. When Jeſus ſVer 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk.9. And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22. For the Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne.A ſecond inVerſe 23. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth noVerſe 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me,Verſe 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear tVerſe 26. For as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſeVerſe 27. And hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.To coVerſe 28. Marvel not at this: for the houre is coming, in the which all that are in the graves, ſhalVerſe 30. I can of mine own ſelf do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is juſt, becauſe I Verſe 31.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him.9. There is a lad here wVerſe 10. And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſſe in the place. So the men Verſe 11. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, Verſe 12. When they were filled he ſaid unto his Diſciples, gather up the fragments that remaine, thVerſe 14. Then thoſe men when they had ſeene the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth thVerſe 15. When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take

So when they had rowed about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking oVerſe 21. Then they willingly received him into the ſhip, and immediately the ſhip was at the land wVerſe. 22. The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that theVerſe 26.

Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might worke the workes of God?29. JeſusVerſe 30. They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee, and beleeve tVerſe 32. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread fVer. 33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.InVerſe 34. Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36.

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.39.Verſe 41. The Jewes then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaveVerſe 43 Jeſus therefore anſwered, and ſaid unto them, murmure not among your ſelves.44. No man can Verſe 45.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16. Jeſus anſwered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.Followeth Chriſts replyVerſe 17. If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whetheVerſe 19.

And there were ſet there ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of theVerſe 9. When the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence iVerſe 11. This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22. When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1.

Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17.

And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8.

But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37.

Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5.

And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3.

And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22.

And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8.

AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5.

Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20.

And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22.

Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20.

When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1. THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewes.2. The ſame came toVer. 3. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne agaVer. 4. Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond timeVer. 5. Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be borne of water and of the SpVer. 6. That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.ChVer. 7. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again.8. The winde bloweth where it liſtetVerſe 9. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?10. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid uVerſe 11. Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17. For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world througVerſe 18. He that beleeveth on him is not condemned, but he that beleeveth not is condemned already,Verſe 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: fromVerſe 13. Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt again.14Verſe 15. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, nor come hither to dVerſe 16. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come hither.17. The woman anſwered, and ſaiVer. 19. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.20. Our fathers worſhippeVerſe 21. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mouVerſe 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jewes.In theVerſe 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37. And herein is that ſaying true: One ſoweth, and another reapeth.38. I ſent you to reap thaVerſe 39. And many of the Samaritanes of that City beleeved on him for the ſaying of the woman, whicVerſe 43. Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares.6. When Jeſus ſVer 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk.9. And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22. For the Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne.A ſecond inVerſe 23. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth noVerſe 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me,Verſe 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear tVerſe 26. For as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſeVerſe 27. And hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.To coVerſe 28.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him.9. There is a lad here wVerſe 10. And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſſe in the place. So the men Verſe 11. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, Verſe 12. When they were filled he ſaid unto his Diſciples, gather up the fragments that remaine, thVerſe 14. Then thoſe men when they had ſeene the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth thVerſe 15. When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take

So when they had rowed about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking oVerſe 21. Then they willingly received him into the ſhip, and immediately the ſhip was at the land wVerſe. 22. The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that theVerſe 26.

Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might worke the workes of God?29. JeſusVerſe 30. They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee, and beleeve tVerſe 32. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread fVer. 33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.InVerſe 34. Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36.

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.39.Verſe 41. The Jewes then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaveVerſe 43 Jeſus therefore anſwered, and ſaid unto them, murmure not among your ſelves.44. No man can Verſe 45.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16. Jeſus anſwered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.Followeth Chriſts replyVerſe 17. If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whetheVerſe 19.

That was the true lighVer. 10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.11. He came Ver. 12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſonnes of God, even to theVer. 14. And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us (and we beheld his glory, as the glory ofVer. 15. John bare witneſſe of him, and cried, ſaying, This was he of whom I ſpake, He that cometh aVer. 16. And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.In the next branch of this comVer. 17. For the Law was given by Moſes; but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.In the third brancVer. 18. No man hath ſeene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the boſome of the Ver. 19. And this is the record of John, when the Jewes ſent Prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem, to Ver. 22. Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou, that we may give an anſwer to them that ſent us? WhaVer. 24. And they which were ſent were of the Phariſees.25. And they asked him, and ſaid unto him, WVerſe 28. Theſe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.Unto this teſtVerſe 29. The next day John ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him, and ſaith, Behold, the Lamb of God, which tVer. 30. This is he, of whom I ſaid, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was Ver. 31. And I know him not: but that he ſhould be made manifeſt unto Iſrael, therefore am I come baVer. 32. And John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven like a dove, and it aVer. 35. Again the next day after, John ſtood, and two of his diſciples.36. And looking upon Jeſus aVer. 37. And the two Diſciples heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus.38. Then Jeſus turned and ſaVer. 40. One of the two which heard John ſpeak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.4Ver. 43. The day following, Jeſus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and ſaith unto hiVerſe 45. Philip findeth Nathaneel, and ſaith unto him, We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law aVerſe 47. Jeſus ſaw Nathaneel coming to him, and ſaith of him, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom iVerſe 50. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-treeVer. 1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jeſus was thereVer. 3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jeſus ſaith unto him. They have no wine.4. Jeſus ſaVer. 5. His mother ſaith unto the ſervants, Whatſoever he ſayth unto you do it.Secondly; by way of pVerſe 6. And there were ſet there ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of theVerſe 9. When the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence iVerſe 11. This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22. When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1. THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewes.2. The ſame came toVer. 3. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne agaVer. 4. Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond timeVer. 5. Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be borne of water and of the SpVer. 6. That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.ChVer. 7. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again.8. The winde bloweth where it liſtetVerſe 9. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?10. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid uVerſe 11. Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17. For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world througVerſe 18. He that beleeveth on him is not condemned, but he that beleeveth not is condemned already,Verſe 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27. John anſwered, and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.FolVerſe 28. Ye your ſelves bear me witneſſe, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent befoVerſe 29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroome: but the friend of the bridegroome, which ſtandeVerſe 30. He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.A third difference betwixt Chriſt and John, is, thatVerſe 31. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speakethVerſe 32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony.AVer. 33. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8. FoVerſe 10. Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaiVerſe 11. The woman ſaith unto him,

Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: fromVerſe 13. Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt again.14Verſe 15. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, nor come hither to dVerſe 16. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come hither.17. The woman anſwered, and ſaiVer. 19. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.20. Our fathers worſhippeVerſe 21. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mouVerſe 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jewes.In theVerſe 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37. And herein is that ſaying true: One ſoweth, and another reapeth.38. I ſent you to reap thaVerſe 39. And many of the Samaritanes of that City beleeved on him for the ſaying of the woman, whicVerſe 43. Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight yeares.6. When Jeſus ſVer 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk.9. And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22. For the Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne.A ſecond inVerſe 23. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth noVerſe 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me,Verſe 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear tVerſe 26. For as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſeVerſe 27. And hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.To coVerſe 28. Marvel not at this: for the houre is coming, in the which all that are in the graves, ſhalVerſe 30. I can of mine own ſelf do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is juſt, becauſe I Verſe 31.

AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias:This hVerſe 2. And a great multitude followed him, becauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them thatVerſe 3. And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſate with his diſciples.Followeth another aVerſe 4. And the Paſſeover, a feast of the Jewes was nigh.In this verſe the circumſtance of the timeVerſe 5 When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto PhiliVerſe 8. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him.9. There is a lad here wVerſe 10. And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſſe in the place. So the men Verſe 11. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, Verſe 12. When they were filled he ſaid unto his Diſciples, gather up the fragments that remaine, thVerſe 14. Then thoſe men when they had ſeene the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth thVerſe 15. When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take

So when they had rowed about five and twenty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking oVerſe 21. Then they willingly received him into the ſhip, and immediately the ſhip was at the land wVerſe. 22. The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that theVerſe 26.

Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might worke the workes of God?29. JeſusVerſe 30. They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee, and beleeve tVerſe 32. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread fVer. 33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.InVerſe 34. Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36.

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.39.Verſe 41. The Jewes then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaveVerſe 43 Jeſus therefore anſwered, and ſaid unto them, murmure not among your ſelves.44. No man can Verſe 45.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16. Jeſus anſwered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.Followeth Chriſts replyVerſe 17. If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whetheVerſe 19.

Then they ſought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet cVer. 31. And many of the people beleeved on him and ſaid, When Chriſt commeth, will he do moe miraclVerſe 32. The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him: And the PhariſeesVerſe 33. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go unto him that ſVer. 35.

And there were ſet there ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of theVerſe 9. When the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence iVerſe 11. This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22. When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this uVerſe 23. Now when he was in Hieruſalem at the Paſſeover in the feaſt day, many believed in his NameVerſe 1.

Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,Verſe 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve if I tell you Verſe 13. And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Sonne oVer. 14. And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifVer. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whoſever beleeveth Verſe 17.

And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27.

He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.The receiving Verſe 34. For he whom God hath ſent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaVerſe 35. The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into his hand.A ſixth difference, iVerſe 36. He that beleeveth on the Sonne hath everlaſting life, and he that beleeveth not the Sonne,Verſe 1. WHen therefore the Lord knew, how the Phariſees had heard, that Jeſus made and baptized moeVerſe 4. And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8.

But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpiVerſe 25. The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is cVerſe 27. And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35. Say not ye, there are yet foure moneths, and then cometh harveſt? Behold I ſay unto you, LVerſe 36. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he Verſe 37.

Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeve.Chriſt wilVerſe 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.50. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go Verſe 51. And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy ſonne livethVerſe 54. This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into GalileVerſe 1. AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5.

And immediately the man was made whoVerſe 10. The Jewes therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath, It is not lawful for Verſe 14. Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole,Verſe 17. But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.In the third part of the CVerſe 18. Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22.

This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22.

After theſe things came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarriVerſe 25. Then there aroſe a queſtion, between ſome of Johns diſciples and the Jewes about purifyingVerſe 27.

And he muſt needs go thorow Samaria.5. Then cometh he to a City of Samaria, which is calledVerſe 7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink.8.

And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man Verſe 31. In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eate.32. But he ſaid unto themVerſe 35.

Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee.44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifVerſe 46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a ceVerſe 48.

AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jewes, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.Several circumſtVerſe 2. Now there is at Hieruſalem by the ſheep-market, a poole which is called in the Hebrew tonguVerſe 5.

Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20. For the Father loveth the Sonne, and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth: and he wilVerſe 21. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Sonne quickeneth wVerſe 22.

This beginning of miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory, aVerſe 12. After this he went down into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciVerſe 13. And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18. Then anſwered the Jewes, and ſaid unto him, What ſigne ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that tVerſe 20. Then ſaid the Jewes, Fourty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reareVerſe 22.

Therefore the Jewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the SabbatVerſe 19. Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, The Sonne can do nVerſe 20.

And the Jewes Paſſeover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Hieruſalem.14. And found in the Verſe 17. And his diſciples remembred, that it was written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me upVerſe 18.

Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.Chriſts commending of this breaVerſe 35. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger:Verſe 36.

Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and are dead.50. This is the bread which coVerſe 51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Verſe 52. The Jewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his fleſh Verſe 53. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Verſe 54. Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up atVerſe 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.To confirme the certainty of thiVerſe 56.

When Jeſus knew in himſelfe that his diſciples murmured at it, he ſaid unto them, Doth thiVerſe 62.What and if ye ſhall ſee the Sonne of man aſcend up where he was before.In this and the folVerſe 63. It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpake untoVerſe 64. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they weVerſe 66. From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.Followeth anotVer. 67. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away?Upon this ſad event and defection of Ver. 68. Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal liVerſe 70. Jeſus anſwered them, Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?71. He ſpake Ver. 1.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but aVer. 11. Then the Jewes ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he?12. And there was much murmurVerſe 14. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the Temple, and taught.Followeth the Verſe 15. And the Jewes marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?FollowVerſe 16.

The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him: And the PhariſeesVerſe 33. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go unto him that ſVer. 35.

Many of the people therefore, when they heard this ſaying, ſaid, Of a truth this is the ProVerſe 45.
